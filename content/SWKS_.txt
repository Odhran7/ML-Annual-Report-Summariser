 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

named executive officers 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during our fiscal year ended october 1 2021 “fiscal year 2021” as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2021 our named executive officers were 

• liam k griffin chairman chief executive officer and president 

• kris sennesael senior vice president and chief financial officer 

• carlos s bori senior vice president sales and marketing 

• robert j terry senior vice president general counsel and secretary and 

• karilee a durham senior vice president human resources 

engagement with stockholders regarding executive compensation 

in evaluating and establishing our executive compensation policies and programs our compensation committee values and actively considers the opinions expressed by our stockholders through the “sayonpay” advisory vote at each annual stockholder meeting as well as through our ongoing stockholder engagement efforts in order to better understand the lack of broad stockholder support for the “sayonpay” proposal at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders the chairman of our compensation committee ms king took a leading role in our formal postmeeting stockholder outreach in which we solicited feedback on our fiscal year 2020 compensation program from more than thirty of our largest institutional stockholders representing approximately 51 of the company’s shares outstanding our company management held subsequent engagement meetings with stockholders representing approximately 39 of the company’s shares outstanding including eight of our ten largest stockholders with ms king joining more than a dozen meetings with stockholders representing approximately 34 of the company’s shares outstanding 

during these conversations our institutional stockholders generally expressed support for the company’s strategy performance and management with most stockholders who had voted against the “sayonpay” proposal noting that such opposition had been primarily in response to the onetime stockbased compensation awards made to the named executive officers in november 2019 to address significant retention concerns many stockholders while supporting the majority of the company’s compensation policies nonetheless suggested modifications to specific plan designs including to the metrics and performance periods under the company’s longterm stockbased compensation program after considering this input from our stockholders as well as evaluating practices related to executive compensation by public companies generally and our peer group specifically our compensation committee committed to several key responsive changes to the company’s compensation program the following changes were adopted after the conclusion of the company’s fiscal year 2021 which is described in this “ compensation discussion and analysis ” section and therefore generally apply beginning with the company’s fiscal year 2022 compensation program 



approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which we compete for executive talent and to link the compensation of our named executive officers to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

• ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

• providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

• providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving company financial performance targets 

• providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders by rewarding them for longterm increases in stockholder value and 

• ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to our employees 

retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairman and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest company management also purchases published compensation and benefits surveys from aonradford and on occasion engages certain affiliates of aon 

radford in various jurisdictions for services unrelated to executive compensation and benefits engagements for which the company’s management has not sought the compensation committee’s approval the fees paid to aonradford and its affiliates in fiscal year 2021 for these surveys and additional services did not exceed 120000 

use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and each of the other named executive officers with “comparator group” data for each position and uses this comparison data to help inform its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” for fiscal year 2021 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii data from the group of 16 publicly traded semiconductor companies listed below our selected peer group for fiscal year 2021 remained unchanged from that used by the compensation committee for the prior fiscal year the peer group includes many business competitors as well as certain larger semiconductor companies with which we compete for executive talent 



 

1 for the company’s fiscal year 2022 compensation program we made adjustments to our peer group to improve comparability specifically we removed applied materials broadcom and nvidia all of which are significantly larger than the company as measured by multiple factors including market capitalization and annual revenue and added western digital and nxp semiconductors both of which are more comparable in size to the company 

the compensation committee generally seeks to make decisions regarding each named executive officer’s compensation that are competitive within the comparator group with consideration given to the executive’s role responsibility performance and length of service after reviewing the comparator group data and considering the input of aonradford the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and stockbased compensation for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2021 aonradford advised the compensation committee that such components of executive compensation for fiscal year 2021 were competitive for chief executive officers and other executive officers at companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer for fiscal year 2021 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining and incentivizing a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the length of our chief executive officer’s service to the company our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation 

the compensation committee considered the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations were based on an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also took into account internal factors such as scope of role and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives and health and welfare benefits for fiscal year 2021 the compensation committee sought to make decisions that would result in each named executive officer’s target total direct compensation being competitive within the comparator group with consideration given to the executive’s role responsibility performance and length of service 

base salary 

the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford in order to provide flexibility in consideration of differences in individual executives’ scope of responsibilities length of service and performance the compensation committee did not target a specific percentile of the comparator group for executive officer salaries however the salaries of the executive officers were generally near the median of the comparator group the base salary for fiscal year 2021 for each named executive officer as reflected in the table below increased on average 45 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2020 with increases ranging from 39 to 57 salary increases were based on the marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford as well as recommendations by the chief executive officer for named executive officers other than himself 

 

shortterm incentives 

overview 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee and is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total cash compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally one year or less in duration the fiscal year 2021 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” adopted by the compensation committee on december 14 2020 was based on the company’s achievement of corporate performance goals established on a semiannual basis during fiscal year 2021 

consistent with the plan structure from the prior fiscal year the incentive plan was established with two sixmonth performance periods the compensation committee determined that semiannual performance periods remained appropriate for fiscal year 2021 in light of continued uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic as with the prior year this approach proved to be appropriate for fiscal year 2021 as the performance goals set by the compensation committee for the second performance period as discussed below reflected a significantly improved business outlook that resulted from greaterthanexpected increases in overall demand for our wireless connectivity products 

incentive opportunities 

for each executive officer shortterm incentive compensation at the “target” level is designed to be near the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group after reviewing comparator group data the 

compensation committee determined that the target incentive under the incentive plan as a percentage of base salary for each of the named executive officers should not be changed as compared to the target incentives under the prior year’s shortterm incentive plan 

the following table shows the range of shortterm incentive compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2021 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 

 

performance goals 

in december 2020 and may 2021 the compensation committee established performance goals for the applicable semiannual performance period with each executive eligible to earn up to half of his or her annual shortterm incentive compensation with respect to each sixmonth period under the incentive plan any unearned amounts with respect to the first performance period were to be forfeited and could not be earned later based on performance during the second performance period or fullyear performance payments under the incentive plan were based on achieving revenue and nongaap ebitda performance goals each of which was weighted at 50 for each respective performance period ebitda for purposes of the nongaap ebitda performance goal was calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to the company’s nongaap operating income as publicly reported in the company’s earnings release for the applicable period 

the target level performance goals were established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan after reviewing the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results relative to peers and were designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the threshold level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan in each case exceeded the company’s actual performance during the corresponding performance period during the prior fiscal year the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded the performance goals established for the second half of fiscal year 2021 were based on the company’s outlook in may 2021 for the remainder of the fiscal year which included expectations for revenue and nongaap ebitda that were significantly higher than the company’s original operating plan resulting in an upward adjustment to the metrics from the preliminary metrics discussed in december 2020 

the performance goals established under the incentive plan for fiscal year 2021 were as follows 



the incentive plan stipulated that payouts to executives following the end of the fiscal year under either of the performance metrics were conditioned upon the company achieving fullyear nongaap operating income of 650 million which is increased from the 500 million threshold that applied for the prior fiscal year nongaap operating income for purposes of the incentive plan is based on the company’s publicly disclosed nongaap operating income—which is calculated by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles settlements gains losses and impairments restructuringrelated charges and certain deferred executive compensation—after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan 

calculation of incentive plan payments 

under the incentive plan upon completion of the first six months of the fiscal year the compensation committee determined the extent to which the company’s performance goals for the first performance period were attained reviewed the ceo’s recommended payouts under the incentive plan and approved the awards to be made under the incentive plan with respect to the first performance period upon completion of the fiscal year the compensation committee completed the same process with respect to the second performance period payments with respect to the first performance period were capped at 100 of the first half target level attributable to the applicable metric with amounts over the target level held back and paid after the end of the fiscal year upon certification that the company had achieved its nominal level of nongaap operating income for the fiscal year 

achievement under the performance goals at the “threshold” “target” or “maximum” level corresponds to payment under the incentive plan at the “threshold” “target” or “maximum” percentage as applicable with such percentage multiplied by the executive’s base salary for the sixmonth period and then multiplied by the weighting assigned to that performance goal the payout for achievement under the performance goals between either the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels would be based on linear interpolation between the two relevant amounts 

each executive’s payment under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible incentive payment earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts the compensation committee retained the discretion to make payments upon consideration of recommendations by the chief executive officer even if the threshold performance metrics were not met or if the nominal level of nongaap operating income was not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeded the maximum metrics while the compensation committee believed it was appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive compensation awards in appropriate extraordinary circumstances no such adjustments were actually made 

fiscal year results 

for the first half of fiscal year 2021 the company’s revenue and nongaap ebitda achieved were 2682 million and 1226 million respectively resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer with respect to such performance period equal to his or her maximum payment level or 200 of the target payment level a payment of the target amount was made to each named executive officer in may 2021 with the remainder held back for potential payment following the completion of the fiscal year for the second half of fiscal year 2021 the company’s revenue and nongaap ebitda achieved were 2367 million and 1050 million respectively resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer with respect to such performance period equal to his or her maximum payment level or 200 of the target payment level in determining the company’s performance for the second half of fiscal year 2021 the company excluded all impacts to revenue and nongaap ebitda resulting from the acquisition in july 2021 of silicon labs’ infrastructure and automotive business  in november 2021 upon certifying that the nominal level of nongaap operating income had been achieved for the fiscal year the compensation committee approved payment of the shortterm incentive achieved with respect to the second performance period as well as payment of the remaining portion of the shortterm incentive achieved with respect to the first performance period which had been held back the compensation committee did not exercise discretion either upward or downward to executives’ payments under the incentive plan 

the following table shows the company’s achievement under the incentive plan 



longterm stockbased compensation 

overview 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over periods of time greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2021 the compensation committee made an annual stockbased compensation award to each of the named executive officers on november 11 2020 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting 

fiscal year 2021 stockbased compensation awards 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2021 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group grant data by executive position the compensation committee used that data to inform its determination of a target dollar value for the longterm stockbased award for each executive officer as set forth in the table below targeting awards for fiscal year 2021 that were competitive within the comparator group each executive officer was granted a performance share award “psa” and a restricted stock unit “rsu” award equivalent to sixty percent 60 and forty percent 40 respectively of the dollar value of the executive’s fiscal year 2021 stockbased award calculating the number of shares subject to each award using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of our stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics and we believe the compensation committee’s decision to award a portion of the psas subject to performance metrics measured over a multiyear performance period more closely aligns the executive’s interests with those of our stockholders 



 

1the grant date fair values of these stockbased awards as disclosed further below in the “summary compensation table” and the “grants of planbased awards table” differ from the values stated above due to the grant date fair value of the psas being computed using a monte carlo simulation to value the portion of the award related to tsr percentile ranking in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 

2reflects the dollar value of the award divided by 14387 per share which was the closing price of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market on november 11 2020 

after setting award levels by position and evaluating our business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees as well as internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees the compensation committee also reviewed the comparator group data to set the aggregate number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards to eligible nonexecutive employees of the company as a percentage of the total number of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock 

fy21 psas 

the psas granted on november 11 2020 the “fy21 psas” have both “performance” and “continued employment” conditions that must be met in order for the executive to receive shares underlying the award 

the “performance” condition of the fy21 psas compares the company’s performance under three distinct performance metrics during the applicable performance period against a range of preestablished targets as follows 



 

1 the emerging revenue growth metric measures the company’s yearoveryear revenue growth in certain key product categories each of which represents an identified longerterm growth market for the company 

2 the design win metric measures the success of the company in achieving specific product design wins with a key customer 

3 the tsr percentile ranking metric measures the company’s percentile ranking achieved with respect to its peer group the peer group for purposes of the tsr percentile ranking metric includes each of the companies in the philadelphia semiconductor index as of november 11 2020 but excludes any such company that during the threeyear performance period is acquired by or merged with or enters into an agreement to be acquired by or merged with another entity 

the semiconductor industry generally and in particular many of the markets into which the company sells its connectivity products are characterized by constant and rapid technological change continuous product evolution and short product life cycles including annual product refreshes in some cases recognizing that strong longterm financial performance depends largely on the company’s ability to identify and respond to rapid market changes by introducing new and enhanced products and technologies on a timely basis the compensation committee determined that half of the target value under the fy21 psas should be measured based on oneyear performance periods consistent with the psa design from the prior year 

more specifically the compensation committee retained emerging revenue growth and key customer design wins as oneyear metrics appropriate for focusing our management team on longterm value creation given that revenue growth over the next several years is highly dependent on executing in certain highergrowth product categories as well as on continued success with a key customer that typically leads the market in the adoption of new technologies and maintains an annual sales cycle as in prior years the remaining half of the target value under the fy21 psas was based on threeyear tsr percentile ranking which the compensation committee believed provides an appropriate balance to the oneyear measurement periods 

the specific preestablished targets under the emerging revenue growth and tsr percentile ranking metrics are as follows   

1 given both the company’s contractual confidentiality obligations and the proprietary nature of the specific goals the company cannot publicly disclose the specific threshold target and maximum levels of performance established with respect to the design win metric 

as with the incentive plan the preestablished targets under the fy21 psas were established by the compensation committee after reviewing the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results relative to peers and were designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company 

• emerging revenue growth metric the target level was set at 15 representing abovemarket annual growth the maximum level was set at 30 which the compensation committee believed represented outstanding performance that would be difficult to achieve and the threshold level was set at 0 as a result of continued market uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic 

• design win metric the compensation committee increased the threshold target and maximum levels of performance by 32 15 and 11 respectively from the corresponding levels set for the prior year in order to incentivize a significant increase over the prior year’s performance 

• tsr percentile ranking metric the compensation committee increased the target percentile to the 55 th percentile of the peer group in order to further incentivize abovemedian performance and in response to stockholder feedback received in 2020 

the number of shares issuable under the fy21 psas corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals as follows subject to linear interpolation for amounts between “threshold” and “target” or “target” and “maximum” 



the “continued employment” condition of the fy21 psas provides that to the extent that the performance metrics are met the shares earned under such metrics would vest as follows provided in each case that the executive remains employed by the company through each such vesting date 



 

1 in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability the holder of an fy21 psa or the holder’s estate would receive any earned but unissued shares that would have been issuable thereunder during the remaining term of the award 

during fiscal year 2020 the base period against which fiscal year 2021 emerging revenue performance was measured the company achieved revenue in the specified key product categories of 442 million during fiscal year 2021 the company achieved revenue in the specified key product categories of 996 million representing emerging revenue growth of 125 exceeding the “maximum” level of performance and resulting in achievement with respect to such metric of 200 of the target level of shares in calculating emerging revenue for fiscal year 2021 the company excluded all revenue resulting from the acquisition in july 2021 of silicon labs’ infrastructure and automotive business consistent with the terms of the fy21 psa which required exclusion of the impacts on this metric of any acquisition made by the company during the performance period  performance under this metric significantly exceeded the company’s annual operating plan primarily as a result of strongerthanexpected demand for the applicable products 

also during fiscal year 2021 the company achieved design wins with the specified customer at a level exceeding the “maximum” level of performance resulting in achievement with respect to such metric of 200 of the target level of shares the level of actual achievement under this metric represented a significant increase from the prior year’s performance accordingly upon the compensation committee’s certification of the performance results in november 2021 the company issued 50 of the shares earned by each named executive officer under the fy21 psas with respect to the emerging revenue growth and design win performance metrics the remaining shares earned under such metrics will be issued in november 2022 provided that the named executive officer meets the continued employment condition 

outstanding psas at the end of fiscal year 2021 

as summarized in the table below of the annual psa grants made to named executive officers since fiscal year 2018 the first year in which the compensation committee awarded psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period achievement of the tsr percentile ranking performance metric under the fy21 psas which is subject to a threeyear performance period will be determined following the conclusion of the company’s fiscal year 2023 during the threeyear performance period under the fiscal year 2019 psas comprising the company’s fiscal years 2019 2020 and 2021 the company achieved a tsr of 105 resulting in its ranking in the 448 th percentile against the applicable peer group accordingly the company issued 741 of the “target” level of shares as earned by each named executive officer under the fiscal year 2019 psas with respect to the tsr percentile ranking metric 



 

1 as of january 21 2022 performance under this metric during the applicable performance period is between the “threshold” and “target” levels of performance 

2 as of january 21 2022 performance under this metric during the applicable performance period is below the “threshold” level of performance 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with our objective of having compensation programs that are considered fair to our employees executive officers are eligible to participate in the company’s medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans as well as the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other benefitseligible employees we do not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as we do not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees 

we offered executives the opportunity to participate in a reimbursement program for fiscal year 2021 providing up to an aggregate of 20000 to each executive for the purchase of financial planning services estate planning services personal tax planning and preparation services andor an executive physical no tax grossup was provided for such reimbursements in fiscal year 2021 each of the named executive officers with the exception of ms durham received reimbursement in connection with such services 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by nonsolicit covenants for a period of twelve 12 months after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to 

severance benefits if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the chief executive officer’s changeincontrol agreement the level of each named executive officer’s cash severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his or her annual base salary and shortterm incentive amounts 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his or her employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company

ceo pay ratio 

following is an estimate prepared under applicable sec rules of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees for fiscal year 2021 

• the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer was 16150421 

• the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was 17409 

• based on the foregoing we estimate that our chief executive officer’s total annual compensation was approximately 928 times that of our median employee 

to determine the median of the annual total compensation of our employees we applied the following methodology and material assumptions 

• we did not use the de minimis exception to exclude any nonus employees we have a globally diverse workforce with total headcount of approximately 11000 as of october 1 2021 of which approximately 77 are located outside the united states primarily in locations employing large direct labor forces such as mexico and singapore where wages are significantly lower than in the united states as permitted under sec rules we excluded from our headcount approximately 340 employees who became employees of the company during fiscal year 2021 due to our acquisition of silicon labs’ infrastructure and automotive business the median employee within our employee population was identified consistent with prior years as of the last day of our fiscal year or october 1 2021 and is a fulltime employee in our mexicali mexico facility 

• to identify the median employee we used a consistently applied compensation measure that included total taxable earnings paid to our employees in the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions this included base salary overtime pay shift premiums recognition bonuses annual cash incentive awards and longterm stockbased incentive awards we annualized the compensation of permanent fulltime and parttime employees who were hired after the beginning of the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions 

• using this consistently applied compensation measure we identified an employee at the median and calculated such employee’s total compensation for fiscal year 2021 in accordance with item 402c2x of regulation sk 

• we did not use any costofliving adjustments in identifying the median employee 

• the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer is the amount reported in the “total” column of our summary compensation table for fiscal year 2021 

we believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with item 402u of regulation sk the sec rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions as a result the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies exclusions estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

named executive officers 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during our fiscal year ended october 2 2020 “fiscal year 2020” as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2020 our named executive officers were

• kris sennesael senior vice president and chief financial officer 

• carlos s bori senior vice president sales and marketing 

• robert j terry senior vice president general counsel and secretary and 

• karilee a durham senior vice president human resources 

approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162m of the internal revenue code “irc” solely for purposes of administering any equity awards that may qualify as grandfathered performancebased compensation and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent and to link the compensation of our named executive officers to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

• ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

• providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

• providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving company financial performance targets 

• providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders by rewarding them for longterm increases in stockholder value and 

• ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to our employees 

retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairman and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest company management also purchases published compensation and benefits surveys from aonradford and on occasion engages certain affiliates of aonradford in various jurisdictions for services unrelated to executive compensation and benefits engagements for which the company’s management has not sought the compensation committee’s approval the fees paid to aonradford and its affiliates in fiscal year 2020 for these surveys and additional services did not exceed 120000 

use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and each of the other named executive officers with “comparator group” data for each position and uses this comparison data to help inform its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii data from the group of 16 publicly traded semiconductor companies listed below the company’s selected peer group remained unchanged from that used by the compensation committee for the prior fiscal year the peer group includes many business competitors as well as certain larger semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



the compensation committee generally seeks to make decisions regarding each named executive officer’s compensation that are competitive within the comparator group with consideration given to the executive’s role responsibility performance and length of service after reviewing the comparator group data and considering the input of aonradford the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and stockbased compensation for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2020 aonradford advised the compensation committee that such components of executive compensation for fiscal year 2020 were competitive for chief executive officers and other executive officers at companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining and incentivizing a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the length of our chief executive officer’s service 

to the company our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation 

the compensation committee considered the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations were based on an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also took into account internal factors such as scope of role and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives and health and welfare benefits for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee sought to make decisions that would result in each named executive officer’s target total direct compensation being competitive within the comparator group with consideration given to the executive’s role responsibility performance and length of service 

base salary 

the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford in order to provide flexibility in consideration of differences in individual executives’ scope of responsibilities length of service and performance the compensation committee did not target a specific percentile of the comparator group for executive officer salaries however the salaries of the executive officers were generally near the median of the comparator group the base salary for fiscal year 2020 for each named executive officer as reflected in the table below increased on average 58 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2019 with increases ranging from 50 to 61 salary increases were based on the marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford as well as recommendations by the chief executive officer for named executive officers other than himself 



shortterm incentives 

overview 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee and is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total cash compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally one year or less in duration the fiscal year 2020 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” adopted by the compensation committee on december 17 2019 was based on the company’s achievement of corporate performance goals established on a semiannual basis during fiscal year 2020 

the compensation committee moved to sixmonth performance periods for fiscal year 2020 as opposed to an annual performance period as in previous years as a result of market uncertainty that existed in late 2019 related to the uschina trade war including restrictions on the company’s ability to do business with huawei technology co ltd and certain of its affiliates the “trade war” and its potential impacts on the company’s financial results for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee concluded that establishing performance goals on a semiannual basis in light of these uncertainties would best enable the compensation committee to establish meaningful and appropriate goals for each half of the year this approach proved to be particularly appropriate for fiscal year 2020 as the performance goals set by the compensation committee for the second performance period as discussed below also reflected additional uncertainty in the company’s business outlook that had arisen as a result of the covid19 outbreak 

incentive opportunities 

for each executive officer shortterm incentive compensation at the “target” level is designed to be near the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group after reviewing comparator group data the compensation committee determined that the target incentive under the incentive plan as a percentage of base salary for each of the named executive officers should not be increased as compared to the target incentives under the prior year’s shortterm incentive plan 

the following table shows the range of shortterm incentive compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2020 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



performance goals 

in december 2019 and may 2020 the compensation committee established performance goals for the applicable semiannual performance period with each executive eligible to earn up to half of his or her annual shortterm incentive compensation with respect to each sixmonth period under the incentive plan any unearned amounts with respect to the first performance period were to be forfeited and could not be earned later based on performance during the second performance period or fullyear performance payments under the incentive plan were based on achieving revenue and nongaap ebitda performance goals each of which was weighted at 50 for each respective performance period ebitda for purposes of the nongaap ebitda performance goal was calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to the company’s nongaap operating income as publicly reported in the company’s earnings release for the applicable period 

the target level performance goals were established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan after reviewing the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results relative to peers and were designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company to achieve them the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded the performance goals established for the second half of fiscal year 2020 were based on the company’s outlook in may 2020 for the remainder of the fiscal year and reflected the significant economic uncertainty associated with the covid19 outbreak including an expectation of revenue for the second half of fiscal year 2020 lower than the company’s original operating plan for the fiscal year 

the performance goals established under the incentive plan for fiscal year 2020 were as follows in millions 



the incentive plan stipulated that payouts to executives following the end of the fiscal year under either of the performance metrics were conditioned upon the company achieving a nominal level of fullyear nongaap operating income of 500 million nongaap operating income for purposes of the incentive plan is based on the company’s publicly disclosed nongaap operating income—which is calculated by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles settlements gains losses and impairments restructuringrelated charges and certain deferred executive compensation—after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan

under the incentive plan upon completion of the first six months of the fiscal year the compensation committee determined the extent to which the company’s performance goals for the first performance period were attained reviewed the ceo’s recommended payouts under the incentive plan and approved the awards to be made under the incentive plan with respect to the first performance period upon completion of the fiscal year the compensation committee completed the same process with respect to the second performance period payments with respect to the first performance period were capped at 100 of the first half target level attributable to the applicable metric with amounts over the target level held back and paid after the end of the fiscal year upon certification that the company had achieved its nominal level of nongaap operating income for the fiscal year 

achievement under the performance goals at the “threshold” “target” or “maximum” level corresponds to payment under the incentive plan at the “threshold” “target” or “maximum” percentage as applicable with such percentage multiplied by the executive’s base salary for the sixmonth period and then multiplied by the weighting assigned to that performance goal the payout for achievement under the performance goals between either the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels would be based on linear interpolation between the two relevant amounts 

each executive’s payment under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible incentive payment earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts the compensation committee retained the discretion to make payments upon consideration of recommendations by the chief executive officer even if the threshold performance metrics were not met or if the nominal level of nongaap operating income was not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeded the maximum metrics while the compensation committee believed it was appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive compensation awards in appropriate extraordinary circumstances no such adjustments were actually made 

fiscal year results 

for the first half of fiscal year 2020 the company’s revenue and nongaap ebitda achieved were 1662 million and 729 million respectively resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer with respect to such performance period equal to his or her maximum payment level or 200 of the target payment level a payment of the target amount was made to each named executive officer in may 2020 with the remainder held back for potential payment following the completion fiscal year for the second half of fiscal year 

2020 the company’s revenue and nongaap ebitda achieved were 1694 million and 728 million respectively resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer with respect to such performance period equal to 200 of his or her target payment level in november 2020 upon certifying that the nominal level of nongaap operating income had been achieved for the fiscal year the compensation committee approved payment of the shortterm incentive achieved with respect to the second performance period as well as payment of the remaining portion of the shortterm incentive achieved with respect to the first performance period which had been held back the compensation committee did not exercise discretion either upward or downward to executives’ payments under the incentive plan 

longterm stockbased compensation 

overview 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over periods of time greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee made an annual stockbased compensation award to each of the named executive officers on november 5 2019 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting at the same meeting the compensation committee also approved the grant of a onetime nonrecurring stockbased compensation award to each of the named executive officers in order to address retention concerns further discussed below and to align the longterm compensation opportunity for each named executive officer with those of peer companies 

fiscal year 2020 stockbased compensation awards 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2020 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group grant data by executive position the compensation committee used that data to inform its determination of a target dollar value for the longterm stockbased award for each executive officer as set forth in the table below targeting awards for fiscal year 2020 that were competitive within the comparator group each executive officer was granted a performance share award “psa” and a restricted stock unit “rsu” award equivalent to sixty percent 60 and forty percent 40 respectively of the dollar value of the executive’s fiscal year 2020 stockbased award calculating the number of shares subject to each award using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics and we believe the compensation committee’s decision to award a portion of the psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period more closely aligns the executive’s interests with those of the company’s stockholders

2 reflects the dollar value of the award divided by 9872 per share which was the closing price of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market on november 5 2019 

after setting award levels by position and evaluating the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees as well as internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees the compensation committee also reviewed the comparator group data to set the aggregate number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards to eligible nonexecutive employees of the company as a percentage of the total number of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock 

fy20 psas 

the psas granted on november 5 2019 the “fy20 psas” have both “performance” and “continued employment” conditions that must be met in order for the executive to receive shares underlying the award 

the “performance” condition of the fy20 psas compares the company’s performance under three distinct performance metrics during the applicable performance period against a range of preestablished targets as follows 



 

1 the emerging revenue growth metric measures the company’s yearoveryear revenue growth in certain key product categories each of which represents an identified growth market for the company 

2 the design win metric measures the success of the company in achieving specific product design wins with a key customer 

3 the total stockholder return or tsr percentile ranking metric measures the company’s percentile ranking achieved with respect to its peer group the peer group for purposes of the tsr percentile ranking metric includes each of the companies in the philadelphia semiconductor index as of november 5 2019 but excludes any such company that during the threeyear performance period is acquired by or merged with or enters into an agreement to be acquired by or merged with another entity 

the specific preestablished targets under the emerging revenue growth and tsr percentile ranking metrics are as follows 



 

1 given both the company’s contractual confidentiality obligations and the proprietary nature of the specific goals the company cannot publicly disclose the specific threshold target and maximum levels of performance established with respect to the design win metric the compensation committee established the design win goals such that performance at the target level would exceed the company’s performance relative to the prior year’s performance 

2 for the fy20 psas related to tsr percentile ranking the compensation committee changed the threshold percentage at which the award begins to become earned—to the 25th percentile from the 40th percentile as in prior years—after reviewing the practices of peer companies 

the number of shares issuable under the fy20 psas corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals as follows subject to linear interpolation for amounts between “threshold” and “target” or “target” and “maximum” 



the “continued employment” condition of the fy20 psas provides that to the extent that the performance metrics are met the shares earned under such metrics would vest as follows provided in each case that the executive remains employed by the company through each such vesting date 



 

1 in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability the holder of an fy20 psa or the holder’s estate would receive any earned but unissued shares that would have been issuable thereunder during the remaining term of the award 

during fiscal year 2019 the base period against which fiscal year 2020 emerging revenue performance was measured the company achieved revenue in the specified key product categories of 199 million during fiscal year 2020 the company achieved revenue in the specified key product categories of 442 million representing emerging revenue growth of 122 exceeding the “maximum” level of performance and resulting in achievement with respect to such metric of 200 of the target level of shares also during fiscal year 2020 the company achieved design wins with the specified key customer at a level exceeding the “maximum” level of performance resulting in achievement with respect to such metric of 200 of the target level of shares accordingly upon the compensation committee’s certification of the performance results in november 2020 the company issued 50 of the shares earned by each named executive officer under the fy20 psas with respect to the emerging revenue growth and design win performance metrics the remaining shares earned under such metrics will be issued in november 2021 provided that the named executive officer meets the continued employment condition 

outstanding psas at the end of fiscal year 2020 

as summarized in the table below of psas granted since fiscal year 2018 the first year in which the compensation committee awarded psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period achievement of the tsr percentile ranking performance metric under the fy20 psas which is subject to a threeyear performance period will be determined following the conclusion of the company’s fiscal year 2022 

during the threeyear performance period under the fiscal year 2018 psas comprising the company’s fiscal years 2018 2019 and 2020 the company achieved a tsr of 44 resulting in its ranking in the 28 th percentile against the applicable peer group as a result of failing to achieve the threshold tsr percentile ranking metric no shares were earned by the named executive officers with respect to such performance metric and all psas with respect to such performance metric were cancelled 



 

1 as of january 22 2021 performance under this metric during the applicable performance period is below the “threshold” level of performance 

2 as of january 22 2021 performance under this metric during the applicable performance period is between the “target” and “maximum” levels of performance 

onetime nonrecurring stockbased awards 

the compensation committee also granted each executive officer a onetime nonrecurring stockbased award at its meeting on november 5 2019 the purpose of these awards was to address significant executive retention concerns that came to light during the compensation committee’s planning for fiscal year 2020 compensation more specifically the compensation committee reviewed analyses prepared by aonradford showing that potential future payouts to the executive officers under the company’s longterm incentive program were below the compensation opportunities an executive could expect upon leaving the company and commencing similar employment at a company in the peer group in addition the potential future payouts were below both the median of the peer group and aonradford’s recommended level of potential longterm equity payouts the compensation committee noted that due to aggressive metric setting under the company’s longterm incentive programs—as well as the occurrence of external events beyond the company’s control including the trade war—actual payouts under the company’s longterm incentive program had also lagged behind peer companies in recent years including when adjusting for historical performance at the same time the compensation committee recognized that competition for executive talent had increased significantly in the semiconductor industry as a result of its analysis of these various factors the compensation committee determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to enhance retention by making onetime nonrecurring stockbased awards 

for mr griffin the company’s chief executive officer the onetime nonrecurring stockbased award consisted of a psa that like the fy20 psas has both “performance” and “continued employment” conditions that must be met in order for him to receive shares underlying the award as follows 



 

1 reflects the dollar value of the award divided by 9872 per share which was the closing price of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market on november 5 2019 

the “performance” condition of the psa award measures the company’s nongaap ebitda margin achieved relative to the 16 peer companies listed above during a twoyear performance period comprising the company’s fiscal years 2020 and 2021 with half of the total award available to be earned with respect to each fiscal year within the performance period for purposes of the award nongaap ebitda margin is calculated by dividing nongaap ebitda by revenue for the applicable fiscal year where nongaap ebitda is defined as nongaap operating income plus depreciation and amortization for the applicable fiscal year with respect to the company and each peer group company nongaap ebitda and revenue are calculated based on publicly reported financial information for the applicable fiscal year which for the peer companies consists of the fourquarter period that ends closest to but not later than the end of the company’s applicable fiscal year when calculating the company’s nongaap ebitda margin the impact of any acquisition or disposition occurring within the applicable fiscal year is excluded if the revenue attributable to such acquisition or disposition exceeds 50 million during such period the specific preestablished targets under the psa award are as follows subject to linear interpolation for amounts between “threshold” and “target” or “target” and “maximum” 



the “continued employment” condition of the psa award provides that none of the shares earned based on performance would vest until the second anniversary of the grant date and would vest in full on such second anniversary only if mr griffin remains employed by the company 

during fiscal year 2020 the company achieved a nongaap ebitda margin of 43 which put the company in the 88 th percentile of the peer group resulting in achievement with respect to such metric of 200 of the target level of shares with respect to fiscal year 2020 with such shares to be issued in november 2021 provided that mr griffin meets the continued employment condition 

for the other named executive officers the onetime nonrecurring stockbased award consisted of an rsu award that vests in two equal installments with half of the underlying shares vesting on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date provided the named executive officer remains employed by the company on the applicable vesting date as follows

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with our objective of having compensation programs that are considered fair to our employees executive officers are eligible to participate in the company’s medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans as well as the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as such benefits are 

offered to other benefitseligible employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees 

the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in a reimbursement program for fiscal year 2020 providing up to an aggregate of 20000 to each executive for the purchase of financial planning services estate planning services personal tax planning and preparation services andor an executive physical no tax grossup was provided for such reimbursements in fiscal year 2020 each of the named executive officers received reimbursement in connection with such services 

engagement with stockholders regarding executive compensation 

at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 89 of the votes cast approved our “sayonpay” proposal—the annual advisory vote regarding the compensation of the company’s named executive officers we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations for fiscal year 2019 and that they were generally pleased with the company’s enhanced disclosure of performance metrics and achievement in response to input from our stockholders following our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders at which our “sayonpay” proposal was approved by only approximately 72 of the votes cast nonetheless following the 2020 annual meeting we engaged in formal stockholder outreach soliciting feedback from approximately thirty institutional stockholders representing approximately 53 of the company’s shares outstanding institutions representing approximately 38 of the company’s shares outstanding including twelve of our largest twenty stockholders responded to our outreach and our subsequent conversations covered a variety of governance and compensationrelated topics during these conversations most institutional stockholders expressed approval of the company’s strategy performance and management in addition most stockholders indicated support for the company’s compensation policies and plan designs in general with some stockholders suggesting that going forward the company modify the metrics and performance period duration for certain longterm stockbased awards after considering this input from our stockholders as well as evaluating practices related to executive compensation by public companies generally and our peer group specifically our compensation committee determined that in general its existing executive compensation policies and plan designs remained appropriate and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by nonsolicit covenants for a period of twelve 12 months after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the chief executive officer’s changeincontrol agreement the level of each named executive officer’s cash severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his or her annual base salary and shortterm incentive amounts 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his or her employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our named executive officers are each required to hold the lower of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the applicable multiple of such executive’s current base salary or b the applicable number of shares each as set forth in the table below all of our named executive officers are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines as of the date hereof 



 

1 for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the common stock is not then traded on such market such other market on which the common stock is traded for the twelve 12 month period ending with the determination date 

compliance with internal revenue code section 162m 

for fiscal year 2020 with the exception of compensation grandfathered pursuant to certain transition rules the company will be unable to deduct compensation in excess of 1 million paid to certain executive officers including the chief financial officer as specified under section 162m of the irc the compensation committee uses its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the limit when the compensation committee believes such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders

ceo pay ratio 

following is a reasonable estimate prepared under applicable sec rules of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees for fiscal year 2020 

• the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer was 21800439 

• the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was 17148 

• based on the foregoing we estimate that our chief executive officer’s total annual compensation was approximately 1271 times that of our median employee 

to determine the median of the annual total compensation of our employees we applied the following methodology and material assumptions 

• we did not use the de minimis exception to exclude any nonus employees we have a globally diverse workforce with total headcount of approximately 10000 as of october 2 2020 of which approximately 7900 are located outside the united states primarily in locations employing large direct labor forces such as mexico and singapore where wages are significantly lower than in the united states the median employee identified within this employee population as of october 2 2020 is a fulltime employee in our mexicali mexico facility 

• to identify the median employee we used a consistently applied compensation measure that included total taxable earnings paid to our employees in the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions this included base salary overtime pay shift premiums recognition bonuses annual cash incentive awards and longterm stockbased incentive awards we annualized the compensation of permanent fulltime and parttime employees who were hired after the beginning of the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions 

• using this consistently applied compensation measure we identified an employee at the median and calculated such employee’s total compensation for fiscal year 2020 in accordance with item 402c2x of regulation sk 

• we did not use any costofliving adjustments in identifying the median employee 

• the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer is the amount reported in the “total” column of our summary compensation table for fiscal year 2020 

we believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with item 402u of regulation sk the sec rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions as a result the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies exclusions estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2019 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2019 our named executive officers were 

 response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2019 annual meeting 

at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 72 of the votes cast approved our “sayonpay” proposal—the annual advisory vote regarding the compensation of the company’s named executive officers although we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2019 we also noted that iss recommended a vote against our sayonpay proposal and that our proposal received lower stockholder support than in prior years 

in response to these voting results we engaged in formal stockholder outreach following the 2019 annual meeting soliciting feedback from our top 25 institutional stockholders not including brokerage firms and quantitative funds who have previously indicated that they do not engage in individual conversations with companies representing approximately 54 of the company’s shares outstanding including a significant portion of those stockholders who we believed had voted “against” the 2019 sayonpay proposal stockholders told us that they appreciated the opportunity to engage with management and conversations covered a variety of governance and compensationrelated topics during our conversations most of these institutional stockholders expressed approval of the company’s strategy performance and management as well as support for the company’s compensation policies plan designs and performance metrics however nearly all of the stockholders who had voted against the sayonpay proposal as well as several of the stockholders who had supported the proposal indicated a strong preference that the company provide additional disclosure regarding its performance metrics and achievement against those metrics some of the stockholders also noted that their votes had been influenced by iss’s report which recommended against the sayonpay proposal and highlighted concerns about our disclosure of performance metrics and achievement 

after considering this input from our stockholders and reviewing the disclosure of several of our peer companies the company has enhanced its disclosure of performance metrics and achievement providing additional quantitative disclosure regarding our shortterm and longterm incentive award programs 

approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162m of the internal revenue code “irc” solely for purposes of administering any equity awards that may qualify as grandfathered performancebased compensation and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance 

and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

 retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairman and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations in fiscal year 2019 aonradford received 188430 for survey data and compensation consulting services to the compensation committee 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest company management has separately engaged aon risk solutions an affiliate of aonradford for risk management and insurance brokerage services the company paid 259925 to aon risk solutions in fiscal year 2019 for those services additionally company management has engaged certain affiliates of aonradford in various jurisdictions for consulting and brokerage services unrelated to executive compensation and benefits for which the company paid a total of 23904 in fiscal year 2019 the company’s management did not seek the compensation committee’s approval for such engagements with affiliates of aonradford 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as scope of role and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 14 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 16 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2019 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the incentive targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the length of our chief executive officer’s service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary shortterm incentive target opportunity performance metrics and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2019 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives and health and welfare benefits for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee sought to make decisions regarding each named executive officer’s base salary shortterm incentive opportunity and longterm stockbased incentive award that were competitive within the comparator group with consideration given to the executive’s role responsibility performance and length of service consistent with our objective of having compensation programs that are considered fair to our employees the named executive officers are eligible to participate in the company’s medical dental vision insurance and retirement plans under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other benefitseligible employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability in order to attract and retain their services in a competitive market the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford in order to provide flexibility in consideration of differences in individual executives’ scope of responsibilities length of service and performance the compensation committee did not target a specific percentile of the comparator group for executive officer salaries however the salaries of the executive officers were generally near the median of the comparator group the base salary for fiscal year 2019 for each named executive officer as reflected in the table below increased on average 69 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2018 with increases ranging from 20 to 89 salary increases were based on the marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford as well as recommendations by the chief executive officer 



shortterm incentives 

overview 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee adopted the fiscal year 2019 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards for fiscal year 2019 for certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of corporate performance goals established at the beginning of the fiscal year shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total cash compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally one year or less in duration pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee set a range of shortterm incentive compensation that could be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals 

incentive opportunities 

for each executive officer shortterm incentive compensation at the “target” level is designed to be near the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group after reviewing comparator group data the compensation committee increased the target incentive as a percentage of base salary for the chief financial officer from 90 for fiscal year 2018 to 100 for fiscal year 2019 and for the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer and chief financial officer from 70 for fiscal year 2018 to 80 for fiscal year 2019 the target incentive as a percentage of base salary for the chief executive officer was not increased 

the following table shows the range of shortterm incentive compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2019 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



performance goals 

in november 2018 the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2019 based on achieving certain revenue and nongaap operating income performance metrics each of these two performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward payments under the incentive plan the nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the company’s publicly disclosed nongaap operating income—which is calculated by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles settlements gains losses and impairments restructuringrelated charges and certain deferred executive compensation—after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company to achieve them the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded 

the performance goals established under the incentive plan for fiscal 2019 were as follows in millions 



the incentive plan stipulated that any payouts to executives under either of the performance metrics were conditioned upon the company achieving a nominal level of nongaap operating income of 1305 million 

calculation of incentive plan payments 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm incentive compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal specifically the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm incentive compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 



each executive’s payment under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible incentive payment earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts the compensation committee retained the discretion to make payments upon consideration of recommendations by the chief executive officer even if the threshold performance metrics were not met or if the nominal level of nongaap operating income was not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeded the maximum metrics the compensation committee believed it was appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances

the company’s revenue and nongaap operating income achieved in fiscal year 2019 were 3377 million and 1166 million respectively resulting in the company’s failure to meet either the revenue or nongaap operating income goals at the “threshold” level or to meet the nominal level of nongaap operating income under the incentive plan these financial results reflected the adverse impact of the uschina trade war the “trade war” during fiscal year 2019 in connection with the trade war not only did the company experience an overall reduction in customer demand for its products but the us bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce also placed huawei and certain of its affiliates on the bureau’s entity list in may 2019 the “huawei ban” the huawei ban resulted in significantly reduced shipments to and revenue from huawei during the remainder of the fiscal year the negative effects of the trade war had not been anticipated by the compensation committee when it originally established performance targets for fiscal year 2019 

in november 2019 following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determined that the adverse impact of the trade war as described above was outside of management’s control given the extraordinary and unexpected nature of such impact the compensation committee waived the condition under the incentive plan that the company achieve a nominal level of nongaap operating income and made adjustments to the revenue and nongaap operating income metrics of the incentive plan specifically after considering a detailed analysis of multiple effects of the trade war on the company’s financial results the compensation committee adjusted the company’s performance metrics for purposes of calculating payments under the incentive plan to account for 564 million and 285 million in estimated revenue and nongaap operating income lost by the company during fiscal year 2019 respectively as a result of the trade war the company’s revenue and nongaap operating income achieved in fiscal year 2019 under the incentive plan as adjusted equated to achievement of 777 and 513 of the target level respectively and resulted in a payment to each named executive officer equal to 645 of the named executive officer’s target incentive 

with respect to the company’s nonexecutive incentive plans—which originally had performance goals that were depending on the business unit either equivalent to or based on the performance goals established under the incentive plan—the compensation committee elected in february 2019 to make a downward adjustment to the respective performance goals in order to account for the initial impacts of the trade war on the company’s financial performance these midyear goal adjustments together with later adjustments related to the huawei ban resulted in incentive payments to nonexecutive employees equal to on average 78 of the employees’ target incentives the incentive plan awards paid to the named executive officers were lower as a percentage of the target incentive than the average shortterm incentive awards paid to nonexecutive employees of the company for fiscal year 2019 

longterm stockbased compensation 

overview 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over periods of time greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers on november 6 2018 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting 

fiscal year 2019 stockbased compensation awards 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2019 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group grant data by executive position the compensation committee used that data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer targeting awards for fiscal year 2019 that were competitive within the comparator group after setting award levels by position and evaluating the company’s business 

needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees as well as internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees the compensation committee also reviewed the comparator group data to set the aggregate number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards to eligible employees of the company as a percentage of the total number of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock 

sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value of each executive officer’s longterm equitybased award served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” to award to the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the remaining forty percent 40 of the dollar value equivalent served as the basis for determining a number of restricted stock units “rsus” to award to the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics and we believe the compensation committee’s decision to award a portion of the psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period more closely aligns the executive’s interests with those of the company’s stockholders 

fy19 psas 

the psas granted on november 6 2018 the “fy19 psas” have both “performance” and “continued employment” conditions that must be met in order for the executive to receive shares underlying the award 

the “performance” condition of the fy19 psas compares the nongaap ebitda growth achieved with respect to 50 of the shares underlying the psa award and the total stockholder return or tsr percentile ranking achieved with respect to our peer group with respect to the other 50 of the shares underlying the psa award during the applicable performance period against a range of preestablished targets as follows 



the performance period with respect to the nongaap ebitda growth metric was the company’s fiscal year 2019 and the performance period with respect to the tsr percentile ranking metric is the threeyear period comprising the company’s fiscal years 2019 2020 and 2021 the peer group for purposes of the tsr percentile ranking metric includes each of the companies in the sp semiconductor select industry index as of november 6 2018 but excludes any such company that during the threeyear performance period is acquired by or merged with or enters into an agreement to be acquired by or merged with another entity 

the number of shares issuable under the fy19 psas corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals as follows 



performance in between either the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels results in the issuance of an interpolated number of shares between the number of shares issuable under the fy19 psas at respectively the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels 

the nongaap ebitda growth performance goal is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to the company’s nongaap operating income as publicly reported in the company’s earnings release for the applicable period after making certain adjustments if necessary to account for certain qualifying acquisition or disposition activities 

the “continued employment” condition of the fy19 psas provides that to the extent that the nongaap ebitda growth performance metric was met 50 of the total shares earned under such metric would vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50 of the total shares earned under such metric would vest on the second anniversary of the grant date and to the extent that the tsr percentile ranking performance metric was met 100 of the total shares earned under such metric would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided in each case that the executive remains employed by the company through each such vesting date in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability the holder of an fy19 psa or the holder’s estate would receive any earned but unissued shares that would have been issuable thereunder during the remaining term of the award 

during fiscal year 2018 the base period against which fiscal year 2019 performance was measured the company achieved nongaap ebitda of 1728 million during fiscal year 2019 the company achieved nongaap ebitda of 1494 million failing to achieve the threshold nongaap ebitda growth performance goal although the company’s nongaap ebitda for fiscal year 2019 was negatively affected by the trade war the compensation committee elected not to make an adjustment to the nongaap ebitda growth performance metric for the fy19 psas as a result no shares were earned by the executives with respect to the nongaap ebitda growth performance metric and all fy19 psas with respect to such performance metric were cancelled 

in february 2019 the compensation committee authorized a supplemental rsu grant to nonexecutive employees who had received fy19 psas which were granted on the same terms as fy19 psas awarded to the named executive officers in recognition that the threshold nongaap ebitda growth performance goal under the fy19 psas was unlikely to be met as a result of the initial impacts of the trade war the company’s executive officers did not receive this supplemental rsu grant 

currently outstanding psas 

as summarized in the table below of psas granted since fiscal year 2018 the first year in which the compensation committee awarded psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period achievement of the tsr percentile ranking performance metric under the fy19 psas which is subject to a threeyear performance period will be determined following the conclusion of the company’s fiscal year 2021 



 other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other benefitseligible employees executive officers are also permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other benefitseligible employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees 

in previous years the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through a thirdparty firm at a cost of up to approximately 19000 per executive paid by the company the compensation committee replaced this benefit for fiscal year 2019 with a reimbursement program providing up to an aggregate of 20000 to each executive 

for the purchase of financial planning services estate planning services personal tax planning and preparation services andor an executive physical no tax grossup was provided for such reimbursements in fiscal year 2019 messrs griffin sennesael gammel and terry received reimbursement in connection with such services 

international assignment agreement with mr gammel 

in connection with his relocation to japan the company and mr gammel entered into an international assignment agreement the “international assignment agreement” pursuant to which mr gammel received a tax equalization payments which were intended to leave mr gammel in a net aftertax position substantially equivalent to what he would experience if he were subject only to us federal and state income taxes during the period of the assignment b payment of or reimbursement for certain costs related to his relocation to japan including moving expenses a car allowance housing costs in japan and travel costs to return periodically to the united states and c repatriation relocation benefits at the completion of his assignment 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by noncompete andor nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the chief executive officer’s changeincontrol agreement the level of each named executive officer’s cash severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his annual base salary and shortterm incentive amounts 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our chief executive officer is required to hold the lower of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to six 6 times such executive’s current base salary or b 147000 shares and our senior vice president and chief financial officer our senior vice president sales and marketing and our senior vice president and general counsel are each required to hold the lower of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two and onehalf 2 1  2  times such executive’s current base salary or b 31300 26900 or 27900 shares respectively for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the common stock is not then traded on such market such other market on which the common stock is traded for the twelve 12 month period ending with the determination date all of our named executive officers who remain employed by the company are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines as of the date hereof

ceo pay ratio 

following is a reasonable estimate prepared under applicable sec rules of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees for fiscal year 2019

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162m of the internal revenue code “irc” solely for purposes of administering any equity awards that may qualify as grandfathered performancebased compensation and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

 retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairman and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations in fiscal year 2018 aonradford received 246580 for survey data and compensation consulting services to the compensation committee 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest company management has separately engaged aon risk solutions an affiliate of aonradford for risk management and insurance brokerage services the company paid 420977 to aon risk solutions in fiscal year 2018 for those services additionally company management has engaged certain affiliates of aonradford in various jurisdictions for consulting and brokerage services unrelated to executive compensation and benefits for which the company paid a total of 77837 in fiscal year 2018 the company’s management did not seek the compensation committee’s approval for such engagements with affiliates of aonradford 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as scope of role and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 11 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 14 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2018 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the incentive targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the length of our chief executive officer’s service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2018 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports

at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 93 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2018 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2018 however the compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2018 annual meeting with the assistance of aonradford after this review and consideration of evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of the compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our benefitseligible employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other benefitseligible employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service the compensation committee did not increase nor evaluate the base salary for mr aldrich for fiscal year 2018 because his base salary had been established in may 2016 at the time of his appointment as executive chairman the base salary for fiscal year 2018 for each remaining named executive officer increased on average 785 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2017 as a result of marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford with increases ranging from 31 to 119 which included increases related to the promotions of messrs bori and terry to senior vice president 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee adopted the fiscal year 2018 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards for fiscal year 2018 for certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established for fiscal year 2018 shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie one year or less pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm incentive compensation that can be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm incentive compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm incentive compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm incentive compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal referred to as the “maximum” level achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm incentive compensation payout at the “maximum” percentage which is designed to be above the median shortterm incentive compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm incentive compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm incentive compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm incentive compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2018 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



  

the actual total amount of shortterm incentive compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to the executive in november 2017 the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2018 based on achieving certain revenue and nongaap earnings per share “eps” performance metrics each of the performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward each named executive officer’s payment under the incentive plan in january 2018 the compensation committee amended the performance goals under the incentive plan to provide that the portion of the incentive awards under the incentive plan that previously was attainable based on the company’s achievement against a nongaap eps performance metric would instead be attainable based on the company’s achievement against a nongaap operating income performance metric the nongaap operating income performance metric had been established by the compensation committee in november 2017 concurrently with the nongaap eps performance metric the compensation committee approved the change in metrics in light of the favorable impact on the company’s nongaap eps for fiscal year 2018 that was expected as a result of tax legislation signed into law on december 22 2017 the “tax act” as well as the potential favorable impact on nongaap eps of the company’s new stock repurchase program adopted in january 2018 at the time of the change in performance metrics in january 2018 the compensation committee believed this change maintained the original rigor of the performance incentive objectives of the incentive plan and negated a potential windfall attributable to the tax act changes or to repurchase activity the nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating income which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of intangibles restructuringrelated charges and litigation settlement gains losses and expenses 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm incentive compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm incentive compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 each executive’s shortterm incentive compensation under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible bonus earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be around the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a nominal performance goal based on nongaap operating income after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan the nominal nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating income which it calculates as described above the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

the company’s actual revenue and nongaap operating income achieved in fiscal year 2018 at 933 and 851 of the target level of performance respectively resulted in a shortterm incentive compensation award for each named executive officer equal to 892 of the named executive officer’s target payment level mr aldrich’s shortterm incentive compensation award was prorated for the portion of fiscal year 2018 during which he was employed 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each 

year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers on november 7 2017 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group competitive grant data by executive position the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of restricted stock units “rsus” to award to the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics and we believe the compensation committee’s decision described below to award psas subject to a performance metric measured over a threeyear performance period more closely aligns the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders a description of the psas including the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” for fiscal year 2018 the compensation committee decided not to award stock options to executive officers after reviewing comparator group data that showed a general move within the industry over the past several years away from stock options grants 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2018 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to approximately 19000 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2018 mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who received financial planning services through ayco and he elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc which became effective on december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change in control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his vested account balance either in a single lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active and upon his retirement during fiscal year 2018 he received a lump sum payment of his vested account balance 

on september 13 2017 the company entered into an international assignment agreement with mr gammel effective as of october 16 2017 the “international assignment agreement” pursuant to which mr gammel has relocated to japan in connection with the international assignment agreement mr gammel is entitled to receive the following a tax equalization payments which are intended to leave mr gammel in a net aftertax position substantially equivalent to what he would experience if he were subject only to us federal and state income taxes during the period of the assignment b payment of or reimbursement for certain costs related to his relocation to japan including moving expenses a car allowance housing costs in japan and travel costs to return periodically to the united states and c repatriation relocation benefits at the completion of his assignment 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the chief executive officer’s changeincontrol agreement the level of each named executive officer’s cash severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his annual base salary and shortterm incentive amounts under his agreement the executive chairman became entitled to certain severance benefits upon the expiration of the term of his agreement in may 2018 as described further below 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our chief executive officer is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to six 6 times such executive’s current base salary or b 135000 shares our senior vice president and chief financial officer our senior vice president sales and marketing and our senior vice president and general counsel are each required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two and onehalf 2 1  2  times such executive’s current base salary or b 28800 25200 or 25800 shares respectively and our chief technology officer is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two 2 times his current base salary or b 20100 shares for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the common stock is not then traded on such market such other market on which the common stock is traded for the twelve 12 month period ending with the determination date as of january 15 2019 all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines 

compliance with internal revenue code section 162m 

for fiscal year 2018 section 162m of the irc generally disallowed a tax deduction for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to our chief executive officer and any of our three other most highly compensated executive officers other than our chief financial officer pursuant to the tax act for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2017 the compensation of our chief financial officer will also be subject to the deduction limitation for fiscal years beginning on or before december 31 2017 certain compensation including qualified performance‑based compensation was not subject to the deduction limit if applicable requirements were met pursuant to the tax act subject to certain transition rules for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2017 the performancebased compensation exception to the deduction limitations under section 162m will no longer be available as a result with the exception of compensation grandfathered pursuant to the transition rules for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2017 all compensation in excess of 1 million paid to the specified executives will not be deductible for the company’s fiscal year 2018 which began on september 30 2017 before the tax act changes to section 162m became effective the compensation committee generally sought to structure the compensation of our executive officers in a manner that was intended to avoid disallowance of deductions under section 162m however the compensation committee reserved the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments to the company’s executives that were subject to the section 162m deduction 

limit when the compensation committee believed such payments were appropriate and in the best interests of the company and our stockholders

fully vested even though the number of shares to be awarded under the fy18 psas had not yet been established as of such date in accordance with the aldrich agreement mr aldrich became entitled to only a prorated portion of the fy18 psas granted to him with such proration based on the number of days mr aldrich performed services for the company in fiscal year 2018 and with the remainder of the fy18 psas being forfeited the fy18 psa value includes only the portion of the fy18 psas earned with respect to the ebitda growth performance metric which was subject to a oneyear performance period and does not include the value of the portion of the fy18 psas to be earned with respect to the tsr percentile ranking performance metric which is subject to a threeyear performance period as described above the maximum value to which mr aldrich would be entitled with respect to such portion assuming maximum performance with respect to the tsr percentile ranking performance metric and assuming a price of 9958 per share is 2031233 

 ceo pay ratio 

following is a reasonable estimate prepared under applicable sec rules of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our ceo to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees for fiscal year 2018 

• the annual total compensation of our ceo was 9342113 

• the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was 20881 

• based on the foregoing we estimate that our ceo’s total annual compensation was approximately 447 times that of our median employee 

to determine the median of the annual total compensation of our employees we applied the following methodology and material assumptions 

• we did not use the de minimis exception to exclude any nonus employees we have a globally diverse workforce with total headcount of approximately 9400 as of september 28 2018 of which approximately 7200 are located outside the united states primarily in locations employing large direct labor forces such as mexico and singapore where wages are significantly lower than in the united states the median employee identified within this employee population as of september 28 2018 is a fulltime employee in our mexicali mexico facility 

• to identify the median employee we used a consistently applied compensation measure that included total taxable earnings paid to our employees in the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions this included base salary overtime pay shift premiums recognition bonuses annual cash incentive awards and longterm stockbased incentive awards we annualized the compensation of permanent fulltime and parttime employees who were hired after the beginning of the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions we applied an exchange rate as of september 28 2018 to convert all international currencies into us dollars 

• using this consistently applied compensation measure we identified an employee at the median as well as other employees nearest the median and calculated each such employee’s total compensation for fiscal year 2018 in accordance with item 402c2x of regulation sk we determined that the originally identified median employee’s total compensation had anomalous characteristics so we exercised discretion as permitted by sec rules to select as the median employee an employee whose compensation we viewed to be more representative of the population near the median 

• we did not use any costofliving adjustments in identifying the median employee 

• the annual total compensation of our ceo is the amount reported in the “total” column of our 2018 summary compensation table 

we believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with item 402u of regulation sk the sec rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions as a result the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies exclusions estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios 

director compensation 

the board of directors sets the compensation for the company’s nonemployee directors after receiving the recommendations of the compensation committee in formulating its recommendations the compensation committee seeks and receives input from aonradford related to the amounts terms and conditions of director cash compensation and stockbased compensation awards with the goal of establishing nonemployee director compensation that is similar to and competitive with the compensation of nonemployee directors at peer companies in the semiconductor industry

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2017 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2017 our named executive officers were 

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 



retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairman and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations in fiscal year 2017 aonradford received 134778 for survey data and compensation consulting services to the compensation committee 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest company management has separately engaged aon risk solutions an affiliate of aonradford for risk management and insurance brokerage services the company paid 430000 to aon risk solutions in fiscal year 2017 for those services the company’s management did not seek the compensation committee’s approval for the engagement of aon risk solutions 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2017 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 20 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 12 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2017 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the incentive targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer for fiscal year 2017 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the length of our chief executive officer’s service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2017 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports 

response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2017 annual meeting 

at our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 95 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2017 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2017 however the compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2017 annual meeting with the assistance of aonradford after this review and consideration of evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of the compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2017 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the compensation committee elected not to increase the base salaries for messrs aldrich griffin and sennesael for fiscal year 2017 noting that the base salaries of messrs aldrich and griffin had been established in may 2016 at the time of their appointments to their current positions and that the base salary of mr sennesael had been established in august 2016 upon the commencement of his employment with the company the base salary for fiscal year 2017 for each remaining named executive officer increased on average 64 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2016 as a result of marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford with increases ranging from 24 to 104 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2017 the compensation committee adopted the fiscal year 2017 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards for fiscal year 2017 for certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established for fiscal year 2017 shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie one year or less pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the 

executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal referred to as the “maximum” level achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” percentage which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2017 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



  

the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2017 based on achieving revenue and nongaap operating margin targets each of the performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward each named executive officer’s payment under the incentive plan the nongaap operating margin performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of intangibles restructuringrelated charges and litigation settlement gains losses and expenses 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 each executive’s shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible bonus earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a nominal performance goal based on nongaap operating income after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan the nominal nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating income which it calculates in the manner described above with respect to nongaap operating margin the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

the company’s actual revenue and nongaap operating margin achieved in fiscal year 2017 resulted in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer equal to 936 of the named executive officer’s target payment level 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2017 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers on november 9 2016 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to the named executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing sale price on the meeting date of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2017 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group competitive grant data by executive position the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer twenty percent 20 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value twenty percent 20 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of restricted stock units to award to the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the psas including the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any 

supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2017 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to approximately 18000 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2017 mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who received financial planning services through ayco and he elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc which became effective on december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change in control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his vested account balance either in a single lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the executive chairman and the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in each executive’s respective agreement in addition the executive chairman is entitled to certain severance benefits upon the expiration of the term of his agreement the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s cash severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his annual base salary and shortterm incentive amounts 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2016 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2016 our named executive officers were 

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including base salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased incentives at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 



 retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 20 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 15 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2016 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the incentive targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of mr aldrich for his service as chief executive officer for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership 

skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the considerable length of mr aldrich’s service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2016 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry mr aldrich was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports 

response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2016 annual meeting 

at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 96 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2016 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2016 however the compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2016 annual meeting with the assistance of aonradford after this review and consideration of evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of the compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2016 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2016 increased on average 63 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2015 excluding mr sennesael whose employment with the company commenced in august 2016 as a result of marketbased salary adjustments recommended by aonradford with increases ranging from 30 to 100 

when mr griffin was promoted to chief executive officer in may 2016 the compensation committee determined that his base salary would be equal to the 850000 base salary that had been approved for mr aldrich his predecessor for fiscal year 2016 in setting mr griffin’s base salary the compensation committee relied on aonradford’s guidance on current market practices related to promotions to chief executive officer in addition to the company’s internal compensation structure and mr griffin’s experience and long tenure 

concurrently with mr griffin’s appointment as chief executive officer and mr aldrich’s appointment as executive chairman in may 2016 the compensation committee determined that mr aldrich’s base salary would be reduced to 800000 in determining mr aldrich’s base salary as executive chairman the compensation committee relied on aonradford’s guidance on current market practices related to chief executive officer transitions in addition to the company’s internal compensation structure and mr aldrich’s experience and long tenure 

mr sennesael was appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer in august 2016 at which time the compensation committee set his base salary based on current market practices for chief financial officers in the semiconductor industry in companies with similar revenue in addition to the company’s internal compensation structure and mr sennesael’s experience and existing compensation package 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee adopted the 2016 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” 

the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned annually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established on an annual basis shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie one year or less pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal referred to as the “maximum” level achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” percentage which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2016 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



  

 the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee determined that the shortterm incentive compensation payable under the incentive plan would be based on the company’s performance for the entire fiscal year consistent with the compensation committee’s approach for the prior fiscal year the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2016 based on achieving revenue nongaap gross margin and nongaap free cash flow targets each of the three performance goals was weighted equally 33⅓ each toward each named executive officer’s payment under the incentive plan the nongaap gross margin performance goal is based on the company’s nongaap gross margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap gross profit sharebased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated expenses the nongaap free cash flow performance goal is based on the company’s nongaap free cash flow which it calculates by deducting capital expenditures from and making certain other adjustments to gaap cash from operations 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 each executive’s shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is calculated by evaluating achievement of each performance goal individually determining the portion of the total eligible bonus earned with respect to each such performance goal and totaling the resulting amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a nominal performance goal based on nongaap operating margin after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan the nominal nongaap operating margin performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income sharebased compensation expense acquisitionrelated expenses amortization of intangibles restructuringrelated charges litigation settlement gains losses and expenses and certain deferred executive compensation the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

the company failed to achieve the nominal nongaap operating margin performance goal in fiscal year 2016 with the result that no shortterm compensation awards were paid to the named executive officers 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers with the exception of mr sennesael on november 9 2015 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to the named executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing sale price on the meeting date of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2016 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its 

employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group competitive grant data by executive position the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the psas including the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

on may 11 2016 the compensation committee granted to mr griffin a onetime restricted stock unit “rsu” award and stock option award in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer the number of shares subject to the equity awards granted to him by the compensation committee was determined based on competitive data on chief executive officer transitions prepared by aonradford the stock option award to mr griffin had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on may 11 2016 a description of the rsu and option awards granted to mr griffin including the vesting conditions thereof is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

on august 29 2016 the compensation committee granted to mr sennesael a longterm stockbased compensation award in connection with the commencement of his employment with the company which was intended to incentivize him to accept an offer of employment with the company and to align his performance with the goals and objectives of the executive team the award to mr sennesael consisted of an rsu award and a stock option award the number of shares subject to the equity awards granted to him by the compensation committee was determined based on competitive data on newhire awards to chief financial officers in the semiconductor industry the stock option award to mr sennesael had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on august 29 2016 a description of the rsu and option awards granted to mr sennesael including the vesting conditions thereof is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2016 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to approximately 16000 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2016 messrs aldrich palette and tremallo received financial planning services through ayco mr aldrich however elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change in control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his vested account balance either in a single lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the 

material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the compensation committee believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the executive chairman and the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in each executive’s respective agreement in addition provided he does not voluntarily terminate his employment with the company before the date of the company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders the executive chairman is entitled to certain severance benefits upon the expiration of the term of his agreement the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and any shortterm incentive earned 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the compensation committee believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers including those named executive officers who are still currently serving as executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our executive chairman and our chief executive officer are each required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to six 6 times such executive’s current base salary or b 160000 or 170000 shares respectively our senior vice president and chief financial officer and our executive vice president worldwide operations are each required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two and onehalf 2 1  2  times such executive’s current base salary or b 35400 shares and our chief technology officer is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two 2 times his current base salary or b 25400 shares for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the common stock is not then traded on such market such other market on which the common stock is traded for the twelve 12 month period ending with the determination date as of january 16 2017 all of our named executive officers who remained executive officers of the company were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines with the exception of messrs griffin and sennesael who each has until the third anniversary of the date he assumed his current position to comply with the guidelines 

compliance with internal revenue code section 162m 

section 162m of the irc generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to our chief executive officer and any of our three other most highly compensated executive officers other than our chief financial officer 

certain compensation including qualified performancebased compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met the compensation committee reviews the potential effect of section 162m periodically and generally seeks to structure the compensation of our executive officers in a manner that is intended to avoid disallowance of deductions under section 162m however the compensation committee reserves the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the limit when the compensation committee believes such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the company and our stockholders after taking into consideration changing business conditions and the performance of our employees

number of shares performance in between either the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels results in an issuance of a number of shares between the number of shares issuable under the fy16 psas at respectively the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels 

the “continued employment” condition of the fy16 psas provides that to the extent that the nongaap operating margin and tsr percentile ranking performance metrics are met for the fiscal year then twentyfive percent 25 of the total shares for which the performance metric was met would be issuable to the executive on the first anniversary of the grant date twentyfive percent 25 of such shares would be issuable to the executive on the second anniversary of the grant date and the remaining fifty percent 50 of such shares would be issuable to the executive on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the executive remains employed by the company through each such vesting date in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability the holder of an fy16 psa or his estate would receive any shares that would have been issuable thereunder during the remaining term of the award ie earned but unissued shares

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2015 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2015 our named executive officers were 

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

 retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2015 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 23 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 17 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2015 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the incentive targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the considerable length of our chief executive officer’s 21 years of service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2015 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports 

response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2015 annual meeting 

at our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 96 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2015 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2015 however our compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2015 annual meeting with the assistance of aonradford after this review and consideration of evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of our compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2015 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2015 increased on average 34 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2014 and ranged from an increase of 30 to 47 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2015 the compensation committee adopted the 2015 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned annually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established on an annual basis shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie one year or less pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal referred to as the “maximum” level achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” percentage which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2015 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him for fiscal year 2015 the compensation committee determined that the shortterm incentive compensation payable under the incentive plan would be based on the company’s performance for the entire fiscal year consistent with the compensation committee’s approach for the prior fiscal year the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2015 based on achieving revenue and nongaap operating margin targets each of the two performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward each named executive officer’s payment under the incentive plan the nongaap operating margin performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges acquisitionrelated expenses litigation settlement gains and losses and certain deferred executive compensation 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 the computation of each executive’s shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is not a weighted average of the level of achievement across all performance goals but rather an evaluation of each performance goal individually a determination of the portion of the total eligible bonus allocated to that performance goal that can be earned and a summation of those amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a performance goal based on nongaap operating margin after accounting for any incentive award payments including 

those to be made under the incentive plan at the “threshold” level the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

the company’s actual revenue and nongaap operating margin achieved in fiscal year 2015 each exceeded the respective maximum performance levels resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer equal to his maximum payment level or 200 of the target payment level 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2015 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers on november 10 2014 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to the named executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing sale price on the meeting date of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2015 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives and employees internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group competitive grant data by executive position the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the psas including the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2015 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to approximately 15000 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2015 messrs aldrich palette and tremallo received financial planning services through ayco mr aldrich however elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change in control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his vested account balance either in a single 

lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and any shortterm incentive earned 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “ potential payments upon termination or change in control ” the company believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers including our named executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our chief executive officer is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to six 6 times his current base salary or b 382200 shares our president is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to three 3 times his current base salary or b 114000 shares our executive vice president and chief financial officer and our executive vice president worldwide operations are each required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two and onehalf 2 1  2  times such executive’s current base salary or b 89800 or 92500 shares respectively and our vice president and general counsel is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two 2 times his current base salary or b 65000 shares for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the common stock is not then traded on such market such other market on which the common stock is traded for the twelve 12 month period ending with the determination date as of january 15 2016 all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines 

compliance with internal revenue code section 162m 

section 162m of the irc generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to our chief executive officer and any of our three other most highly compensated executive officers other than our chief financial officer 

certain compensation including qualified performancebased compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met the compensation committee reviews the potential effect of section 162m periodically and generally seeks to structure the compensation of our executive officers in a manner that is intended to avoid disallowance of 

deductions under section 162m however the compensation committee reserves the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the limit when the compensation committee believes such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the company and our stockholders after taking into consideration changing business conditions and the performance of our employees

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2014 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2014 our named executive officers were 

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

 retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the 

compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 26 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data for a given executive position the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 19 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2014 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from aonradford regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of the other executive officers the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the considerable length of our chief executive officer’s 20 years of service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2014 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the 

semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers and each of his other direct reports 

response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2014 annual meeting 

at our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 96 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2014 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2014 however our compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2014 annual meeting with the assistance of aonradford after this review and consideration of evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of our compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2014 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2014 increased on average 50 from the named executive officer’s base salary in fiscal year 2013 excluding ms vezina whose employment with the company commenced in december 2013 and ranged from an increase of 26 to 88 effective as of may 6 2014 at the time of his promotion to president mr griffin received an additional 75 increase in his base salary which reflected his increased responsibilities 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee adopted the 2014 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned annually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established on an annual basis shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie one year or less pursuant to the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive 

reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal referred to as the “maximum” level achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” level which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2014 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 



  

1 effective as of may 6 2014 at the time of his promotion to president the threshold target and maximum levels of mr griffin’s shortterm compensation were increased from 40 80 and 160 of his annual base salary respectively to 45 90 and 180 of his annual base salary respectively 

the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him or her for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee determined that shortterm incentive compensation payable under the incentive plan would be based on the company’s performance for the entire fiscal year although in recent fiscal years the compensation committee has based shortterm incentive payments on performance during two sixmonth performance periods the compensation committee moved to an annual performance period for fiscal year 2014 to better align with business objectives the compensation committee established performance goals for fiscal year 2014 based on achieving revenue and nongaap operating margin targets each of the two performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward each named executive officer’s payment under the incentive plan the nongaap operating margin performance goal is based on the company’s actual nongaap operating margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges acquisitionrelated expenses litigation settlement gains and losses and certain deferred executive compensation 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply 

following the end of the fiscal year the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 

the computation of each executive’s shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is not a weighted average of the level of achievement across all performance goals but rather an evaluation of each performance goal individually a determination of the portion of the total eligible bonus allocated to that performance goal that can be earned and a summation of those amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a performance goal based on nongaap operating margin after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan at the “threshold” level the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

the company’s actual revenue and nongaap operating margin achieved in fiscal year 2014 each exceeded the respective maximum performance levels resulting in a shortterm compensation award for each named executive officer equal to his or her maximum payment level or 200 of the target payment level 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers with the exception of ms vezina on november 7 2013 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to the named executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing sale price on the meeting date of the company’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market 

in making annual stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made available for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual executive officer equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for the attraction and retention of executives internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers from the overall pool the compensation committee made available for equity awards for fiscal year 2014 the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the psas including the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

on december 9 2013 the compensation committee granted to ms vezina a longterm stockbased compensation award in connection with the commencement of her employment with the company which was intended to incentivize her to accept an offer of employment with the company and to align her performance with the goals and objectives of the executive team the award to ms vezina consisted of a stock option award a psa award and a restricted stock award the number of shares subject to the equity awards granted to her by the compensation committee was determined based on competitive data on newhire awards to human resources executives in the semiconductor industry the stock option award to ms vezina had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on december 9 2013 a description of each stockbased award granted to ms vezina including the vesting conditions thereof is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

 on may 6 2014 the compensation committee granted onetime restricted stock unit “rsu” awards to each of messrs palette griffin and freyman in connection with their promotions to their current positions a description of the rsu awards including the vesting conditions thereof is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

other compensation and benefits 

we provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2014 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to approximately 14000 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2014 mr aldrich mr palette and ms vezina received financial planning services through ayco mr aldrich however elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change in control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his or her vested account balance either in a single lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active 

severance and changeincontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change in control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeincontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “potential payments upon termination or change in control” 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for up to two years after termination of employment outside of the changeincontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his or her respective annual base salary and any shortterm incentive earned 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting of equity awards if his or her employment were terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “potential payments upon termination or change in control” the company believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeincontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeincontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeincontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal year 2013 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” for fiscal year 2013 our named executive officers were 

 approach for determining form and amounts of compensation 

the compensation committee which is composed solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our named executive officers as well as any other executive officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

compensation program objectives 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

1 ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

2 providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

3 providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving company financial performance targets 

4 providing longterm stock‑based compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders and rewards them for increases in stockholder value and 

5 ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all of our employees 

retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

the compensation committee has considered the relationships that aonradford has with the company the members of the compensation committee and our executive officers as well as the policies that aonradford has in place to maintain its independence and objectivity and has determined that aonradford’s work for the compensation committee has not raised any conflicts of interest 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 28 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data—for example for a vpgeneral manager position—the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the “peer” group data for 19 publicly traded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



use of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards as discussed in further detail below under “ components of compensation ” in addition in setting fiscal year 2013 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officer’s performance and v the considerable length of our chief executive officer’s 18 years of service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for 2013 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers 

response to stockholder vote on executive compensation at 2013 annual meeting 

at our 2013 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 94 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2013 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2013 however our compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2013 annual meeting our compensation committee retains the services of aonradford to assist it with that review and to advise it on executive compensation matters after the review and taking into consideration evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of our compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

components of compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by aonradford based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2013 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2013 increased on average 48 from his base salary in 2012 and ranged from an increase of 26 to 100 at the time of his promotion to executive vice president and corporate general manager mr griffin received a 10 increase in his base salary which reflected his increased responsibilities 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee adopted the 2013 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance goals established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in connection with the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer pursuant to the incentive plan based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the executive officer’s base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” level which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level no shortterm 

compensation payment would be made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2013 as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary 

  

the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him as in fiscal year 2012 for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two sixmonth performance periods with the executive eligible to earn up to half of his annual shortterm incentive compensation with respect to each sixmonth period for the first half of fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee established performance goals based on achieving nongaap gross margin and nongaap operating income targets each of the two performance goals was weighted equally 50 each toward each named executive officer’s payment for such period under the incentive plan for the second half of fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee established performance goals based solely on achieving nongaap gross margin targets with each named executive officer’s payment for such period under the incentive plan dependent 100 on performance against such metric 

the nongaap gross margin performance goal is based on the company’s nongaap gross margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap gross profit for the applicable period stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges and acquisitionrelated expenses the nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the company’s nongaap operating income which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income for the applicable period stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges acquisitionrelated expenses litigation settlement gains and losses and certain deferred executive compensation 

the compensation committee determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply the compensation committee sets the performance goals weightings and “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement on a semiannual basis 

at the end of each sixmonth period the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 

the computation of each executive’s shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is not a weighted average of the level of achievement across all performance goals but rather an evaluation of each performance goal individually a determination of the portion of the total eligible bonus allocated to that performance goal that can be earned and a summation of those amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the company’s historical operating results and growth rates as well as the company’s expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the compensation committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the compensation committee believes should be rewarded typically financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a performance goal based on nongaap operating income after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan at the “threshold” level in addition pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan actual payments for the first sixmonth performance period are capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance any amounts held back are subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year provided that the financial performance established in the first six months of the year is sustained throughout the fiscal year and that the executive remains employed with the company at the time of payment the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

for fiscal year 2013 the company’s level of achievement of each performance goal was as follows 

the company’s actual nongaap operating income and nongaap gross margin achieved in the first half of fiscal year 2013 each fell between the respective target and maximum performance levels resulting in potential shortterm compensation awards with respect to each such metric proportionate to the extent such performance fell between the target and maximum performance levels specifically each of the named executive officers was eligible for a shortterm compensation award for the first half of fiscal year 2013 with respect to nongaap operating income and nongaap gross margin equal to 14500 and 11990 respectively of the target payment level which resulted in a total potential award equal to 13245 of the target payment level for such named executive officer the compensation committee exercised its discretion to reduce the potential incentive plan award payable to each named executive officer for the first half of fiscal year 2013 to 12445 of the target payment level for such named executive officer in order to increase payments to certain employees who participated in a nonexecutive shortterm incentive compensation plan maintained by the company the aggregate incentive payments made by the company under both the incentive plan and the nonexecutive shortterm incentive plan were equal to the payments that would have been made had the compensation committee not exercised any discretion consistent with the incentive plan and the other nonexecutive employee incentive plans actual incentive payments for the first half performance period of fiscal year 2013 were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of fiscal year 2013 since the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal year 2013 

the company’s actual nongaap gross margin achieved in the second half of fiscal year 2013 fell between the threshold and target performance levels which translated into shortterm compensation awards proportionate to the distance such performance 

fell between the threshold and target performance levels as a result each of the named executive officers earned a shortterm compensation award for the second half of fiscal year 2013 equal to 7000 of the target payment level for such named executive officer for the full fiscal year 2013 the total payment under the incentive plan to each of the named executive officers was approximately 9723 of the target payment level for such named executive officer 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee made awards to each of the named executive officers on november 8 2012 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to the named executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the meeting date 

in making stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made available for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would be made available for annual executive officer equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the company’s business needs for attraction and retention of executives internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and proxy advisor eg iss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers from the overall pool the compensation committee made available for equity awards for fiscal year 2013 the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards “psas” for the executive using the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the psa the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding psas is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equity awards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the psas the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of planbased awards table ” 

other compensation and benefits 

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any supplemental executive retirement plan or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2013 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through the ayco company lp “ayco” at a cost of up to 14060 per executive paid by the company in fiscal year 2013 all of the named executive officers received financial planning services through ayco mr aldrich however elected to pay personally for such services 

in prior fiscal years certain executive officers were provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan upon retirement as defined in the executive compensation plan or other separation from service or if so elected upon any earlier change of control of the company a participant is entitled to a payment of his or her vested account balance either in a single lump sum or in annual installments as elected in advance by the participant although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so mr aldrich is the only named executive officer who participated in the executive compensation plan while it was active 

severance and changeofcontrol benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations of employment and in connection with terminations of employment under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms of our severance and changeofcontrol arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under “potential payments upon termination or change of control  ” 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the changeofcontrol context each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and any shortterm incentive earned 

additionally each named executive officer would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if his employment is terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change of control of the company these benefits are described in detail further below under “potential payments upon termination or change of control  ” the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes in addition upon the occurrence of a change of control each named executive officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards if any will fully vest and his outstanding psas will be deemed earned as to a the “target” performance level if the change of control occurs during the performance period or b the number of shares deemed earned under the award based on actual performance if the performance period ends on or before the change of control occurs 

the company believes these enhanced severance benefits and accelerated vesting are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a changeofcontrol transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of executive officers that typically occurs in a changeofcontrol context and such severance benefits and accelerated vesting encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the changeofcontrol process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process in addition the vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change of control of the company 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted executive stock ownership guidelines with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers including our named executive officers with those of our stockholders under the executive officer ownership guidelines our chief executive officer is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to six 6 times his current base salary or b 382200 shares our chief financial officer executive vice president and senior vice president worldwide operations are each required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to 25 times his current base salary or b 89800 95000 or 92500 shares respectively and our vice president and general counsel is required to hold the lower  of a the number of shares with a fair market value equal to two 2 times his current base salary or b 65000 shares for purposes of the executive stock ownership guidelines the fair market value of the company’s common stock is the average closing price per share of the company’s common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the shares are not then traded on such market such other market on which the shares are traded for the twelve 12month period ending with the determination date as of january 15 2014 all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines 

compliance with internal revenue code section 162m 

section 162m of the irc generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to our chief executive officer and any of our three other most highly compensated executive officers other than our chief financial officer 

certain compensation including qualified performancebased compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met the compensation committee reviews the potential effect of section 162m periodically and generally seeks to structure the compensation of our executive officers in a manner that is intended to avoid disallowance of deductions under section 162m however the compensation committee reserves the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the limit when the compensation committee believes such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the company and our stockholders after taking into consideration changing business conditions and the performance of our employees

the “performance” condition guides the initial eligibility of the grantee to receive shares under the psa and compares the nongaap operating margin achieved related to 50 of the shares underlying the award and the key product design wins obtained related to the other 50 of the shares underlying the award during the performance period against a range of preestablished targets the compensation committee determines the “threshold” or minimum level of performance that would be acceptable to the company to justify a payout the “maximum” level represents a bestcase performance scenario the middle of the range is referred to by the company as the “target” level and represents the expected performance of the company the number of shares issuable under the fy13 psas corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the “target” number of shares is determined with reference to the competitive level of longterm equity compensation determined by the compensation committee in the manner described above performance at the “threshold” level results in an issuance of a number of shares equal to onehalf  1  2  the “target” number of shares and performance at the “maximum” level results in the issuance of a number of shares equal to two times 2 x the “target” number of shares performance in between either the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels results in an issuance of a number of shares between the number of shares issuable under the fy13 psas at respectively the “threshold” and “target” levels or the “target” and “maximum” levels 

the “continued employment” condition of the fy13 psas provides that to the extent that the nongaap operating margin and key product design win performance metrics are met for the fiscal year then twentyfive percent 25 of the total shares for which the performance metric was met would be issuable to the executive on the first anniversary of the grant date twentyfive percent 25 of such shares would be issuable to the executive on the second anniversary of the grant date and the remaining fifty percent 50 of such shares would be issuable to the executive on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the executive remains employed by the company through each such vesting date in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability the holder of an fy13 psa or his or her estate would receive any shares that would have been issuable thereunder during the remaining term of the award ie earned but unissued shares

 item 11 executive compensation   

compensation discussion and analysis 

who sets compensation for senior executives 

the compensation committee which is comprised solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and each of our other executive officers as well as any other officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal 2012 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” 

how has the company taken into account the results of the stockholder vote on executive compensation at the 2012 annual meeting 

at our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 92 of the votes cast approved the compensation of the companys named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2012 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2012 however our compensation committee still undertook a review of our compensation policies and determinations following the 2012 annual meeting our compensation committee retained the services of aonradford consulting “aonradford” to assist it with that review and to advise it on executive compensation matters after the review and taking into consideration evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies generally upon the recommendation of our compensation committee we determined not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

what are the objectives of our compensation program 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the companys financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committees goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

1 ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

2 providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

3 providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving company financial performance targets 

4 providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders and rewards them for increases in stockholder value and 

5 ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all of our employees   

how do we determine the components and amount of compensation to pay 

the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

retention of compensation consultant   

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford to assist the compensation committee in determining the components and amount of executive compensation aonradford reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultants advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

role of chief executive officer   

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations include an assessment of each individuals responsibilities experience performance and contribution to the companys performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data   

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2012 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 24 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data  for example for a vpgeneral manager position  the comparator group data also included survey data regarding hightechnology companies and ii the public “peer” group data for 17 publiclytraded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



utilization of comparator group data   

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards in addition in setting fiscal year 2012 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each 

named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii our chief executive officers role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on our chief executive officers performance and v the considerable length of our chief executive officers 18 years of service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation established by the compensation committee for 2012 were competitive for chief executive officers leading companies of similar size and complexity in the semiconductor industry our chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers 

what are the components of executive compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical dental vision life and disability insurance and financial planning benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical dental vision or other insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary   

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by its consultant based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2012 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2012 increased on average 38 from his base salary in 2011 and ranged from an increase of 27 to 53 

shortterm incentives   

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2012 the compensation committee adopted the 2012 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the companys achievement of certain corporate performance goals established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentive compensation is intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the companys achievement of preestablished performance goals that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in connection with the incentive plan the compensation committee sets a range of shortterm compensation that can be earned by each executive officer pursuant to the incentive plan based on the comparator group data which is expressed as a percentage of the named executive officers base salary and which corresponds to the level of achievement of the performance goals the low end of that range referred to as the “threshold” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive was at the minimum set by the compensation committee to be eligible to receive a payment for that goal under the incentive plan referred to as the “threshold” level at the threshold payout level the shortterm compensation was designed to result in a payout less than the median shortterm compensation of the comparator group the middle of the range referred to as the “target” percentage is equal to the amount of shortterm compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive met the expectations set by the compensation committee referred to as the “target” level achievement of all performance goals at the “target” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout equal to the “target” percentage which is designed to be the median shortterm compensation paid by the companys comparator group the high end of the range referred to as the “maximum” percentage is equal to the amount of compensation payable to the executive if the level of achievement of each performance goal applicable to the executive reached the highend target set by the compensation committee for such goal achievement of all performance goals at the “maximum” level would result in a shortterm compensation payout at the “maximum” level which is designed to be above the median shortterm compensation paid by the companys comparator group absent an exercise of discretion by the compensation committee the total shortterm compensation paid to each executive would not exceed the “maximum” 

percentage and in the event that the level of achievement of all performance goals was below the “threshold” level would result in no shortterm compensation payment being made to the executive the following table shows the range of shortterm compensation that each named executive officer could earn in fiscal year 2012 as a percentage of such executive officers annual base salary 

  

the actual total amount of shortterm compensation payable to an executive depends on the level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to him the performance goals are a mixture of companyspecific and business unitspecific goals the perexecutive composition of which is determined by the compensation committee with respect to each executive each performance goal assigned to that executive is given a weighting by the compensation committee that represents the percentage of the total shortterm compensation payable under the incentive plan to the executive if that performance goal is achieved as in fiscal year 2011 for fiscal year 2012 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two six month performance periods with the executive eligible to earn up to half of his annual shortterm incentive compensation with respect to each six month period for the first half of fiscal year 2012 the performance goals focused on achieving revenue nongaap gross margin and nongaap operating margin targets in addition to product design win metrics for the second half of fiscal year 2012 the committee established performance goals based on achieving revenue nongaap gross margin and nongaap operating income targets the weighting of the performance goals for fiscal year 2012 for each named executive officer was as follows 

performance goals  fiscal 2012 first half 



performance goals  fiscal 2012 second half 



the revenue performance goal is based on the companys reported gaap revenue the nongaap operating income performance goal is based on the companys nongaap operating income which it calculates by excluding from gaap operating income for the applicable period stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges acquisitionrelated expenses litigation settlement gains and losses and certain deferred executive compensation the nongaap gross margin performance goal is based on the companys nongaap gross margin which it calculates by excluding from gaap gross profit for the applicable period stock compensation expense restructuringrelated charges and acquisitionrelated expenses the product design wins performance goal is based on the total number and the quality or difficulty of achievement of designinstallation projects awarded to or contracted by the company from a preestablished list of such projects where the table above indicates that a performance goal was based on the achievement of the goal by a business unit the performance goal was defined in the same manner but only the results of the applicable business unit were taken into account in setting the achievement levels and measuring performance 

in determining the weightings between performance goals for each named executive officer the compensation committees aim was to align the shortterm compensation of each named executive officer with overall corporate operating strategy for instance the performance goals for the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer and senior vice president worldwide operations were designed to focus such executives on improving the companys competitive position and achieving overall profitable growth for the company the performance goals for the companys former executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions who was an executive officer of the company on september 28 2012 but whose employment with the company ended on december 3 2012 and executive vice president and general manager high performance analog who was promoted to executive vice president and corporate general manager on november 20 2012 were designed to focus those executives on business unit performance ie securing design wins for new products and expanding the companys customer base 

the compensation committee then determines with respect to each performance goal the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement which correspond to the matching descriptions set forth above for company performance goals the levels of achievement will be consistent across the executives to which such goals apply the compensation committee sets the performance goals weightings and “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement on a semiannual basis 

at the end of each six month period the compensation committee determines the total amount of shortterm compensation payable to each executive for such period by comparing the actual level of achievement of each performance goal assigned to such executive against the “threshold” “target” and “maximum” levels of achievement that it set for that performance goal the compensation committee determines the amount of shortterm compensation the executive is eligible to receive with respect to each performance goal as follows 

 the computation of each executives shortterm compensation under the incentive plan is not a weighted average of the level of achievement across all performance goals but rather an evaluation of each performance goal individually a determination of the portion of the total eligible bonus allocated to that performance goal that can be earned and a summation of those amounts 

the target level performance goals established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on the companys historical operating results and growth rates as well as the companys expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum level performance goals established by the committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the committee believes should be rewarded financial performance goals are set with the expectation that the “target” level will be higher than the consensus analyst estimates for the company the “target” level for nonfinancial performance goals are generally set with the expectation that if the actual results are achieved that such achievement would result in a significant positive impact on the company 

the incentive plan stipulated that all payouts to executives under the incentive plan were conditioned upon the company achieving a performance goal based on nongaap operating income after accounting for any incentive award payments including those to be made under the incentive plan at the “threshold” level in addition pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan actual payments for the first six month performance period are capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance any amounts held back are subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year provided that the financial performance established in the first six months 

of the year is sustained throughout the fiscal year and that the executive remains employed with the company at the time of payment the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the companys performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm compensation awards in extraordinary circumstances 

for the first half of fiscal 2012 the companys level of achievement of each performance goal was as follows 

accordingly each of the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the former executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions and the executive vice president and general manager high performance analog earned a shortterm compensation award for the first half of fiscal 2012 equal to approximately 29 18 10 and 30 of his annual base salary respectively the compensation committee exercised its discretion to increase the shortterm compensation award payments to employees of the companys worldwide operations group who participated in either the incentive plan which included the senior vice president worldwide operations or a nonexecutive short term incentive compensation plan maintained by the company by twentyfive percent 25 due to the impact unanticipated pricing pressures had on the companys financial results this increase was funded by reducing the first half incentive plan payments to employees of a business unit which did not include any executive officers such that the overall aggregate incentive payments made by the company under both the incentive plan and the nonexecutive short term incentive plans were equal to the payments that would have been made had the compensation committee not exercised any discretion as a result of the compensation committee exercising such discretion the senior vice president worldwide operations received a first half short term compensation award equal to approximately 9 of his annual base salary instead of 7 of his annual base salary 

consistent with the incentive plan and the other nonexecutive employee incentive plans actual payments for the first half performance period of fiscal 2012 were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of fiscal 2012 since the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal 2012 

for the second half of fiscal 2012 the companys level of achievement of each performance goal was as follows 

accordingly each of the chief executive officer and the vicepresident and chief financial officer former executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and senior vice president worldwide operations earned a short term compensation award for the second half of fiscal 2012 equal to approximately 25 15 15 15 and 14 of his annual base salary respectively in addition the 20 “holdback” of the short term compensation award for the first half of fiscal 2012 was paid out to each executive officer after the end of the fiscal 2012 due to the companys sustained financial performance 

for the full fiscal year the total payments under the incentive plan to each of the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 125 of his annual base salary at the “target” performance level for fiscal 2012 and the vicepresident and chief financial officer the former executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions the executive vice president and general manager high performance analog each of whom was eligible to earn 75 of his annual base salary at the “target” performance level for fiscal 2012 and the senior vice president worldwide operations who was eligible to earn 70 of his annual base salary at the “target” performance level for fiscal 2012 earned approximately 54 33 25 45 and 23 of his annual base salary respectively 

longterm stockbased compensation   

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders and to reward our executive officers for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the companys practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal 2012 the compensation committee made awards to executive officers including certain named executive officers on november 10 2011 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the companys common stock on the meeting date 

in making stockbased compensation awards to executive officers for fiscal year 2012 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of stock that companies in the comparator group typically made available for annual awards under employee equity compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of shares of the companys common stock that would be made 

available for annual executive officer equity awards at approximately the median of the comparator group after its evaluation of the companys business needs for attraction and retention of executives internal and external circumstances impacting the company and its employees and riskmetricsiss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers from the overall pool the committee made available for equity awards for fiscal 2012 the compensation committee then used that data and the comparator group data to determine a dollar value equivalent for the longterm equitybased award for each executive officer forty percent 40 of that dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of stock options to award to the executive using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the dollar equivalent value served as the basis for determining a number of performance share awards for the executive using the fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of such award and an assumption that the company would achieve the “target” level of performance required to earn the performance share award the compensation committees rationale for awarding performance shares is to further align the executives interest with those of the companys stockholders by using equityawards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics a description of the performance share awards the method by which they vest and the related performance metrics is set forth below in the “ grants of plan based awards ” table 

  

other compensation and benefits   

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committees goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical dental vision life and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the companys 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any serp or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2012 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through ayco at a cost of 13000 per executive paid by the company other than mr freyman none of the named executive officers elected to participate in the companypaid program although mr aldrich receives financial planning services from ayco he personally pays for such services 

although certain named executive officers were historically provided an opportunity to participate in the companys executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan”  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation  as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so 

severance and change of control benefits   

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations and in connection with terminations under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms of our severance and change of control arrangements with the named executive officers can be found immediately below and further below under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below   

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the change in control context severance benefits are payable to the named executive officers if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause and in the case of the chief executive officer if he terminates his own employment for good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the companys board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officers severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and any shortterm incentive earned 

additionally the named executive officers would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if their employment terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the 20 golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes the company further believes these enhanced severance benefits are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of each named executive officer and these enhanced severance protections encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the change in control process 

lastly each named executive officers outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards if any fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control in addition each outstanding performance share award shall be deemed earned as to a the “target” performance level if the change of control occurs during the performance period or b the number of shares deemed earned under the award based on actual performance if the performance period ends on or before the change of control occurs the company believes this accelerated vesting is appropriate given the importance of longterm equity awards in our executive compensation program and the uncertainty regarding the continued employment of named executive officers that typically occurs in a change in control context the companys view is that this vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company and encourages the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process 

executive officer stock ownership requirements 

we have adopted an executive officer stock ownership program that requires our executive officers including our named executive officers to hold a significant equity interest in skyworks with the objective of more closely aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders the minimum number of shares of our common stock that the executive officer ownership guidelines require our named executive officers to hold while serving in their capacity as executive officers is as follows 



for purposes of the executive officer ownership program the fair market value of a persons holding is based on the average closing price per share of the companys common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market or if the shares are not then traded on such market such other market on which the shares are traded for the 12month period ending with the determination date as of january 15 2013 all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines

 item 11 executive compensation   

compensation discussion and analysis 

who sets compensation for senior executives 

the compensation committee which is comprised solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and each of our other executive officers as well as any other officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal 2011 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” 

how has the company taken into account the results of the stockholder vote on executive compensation at the 2011 annual meeting 

as we previously reported at our 2011 annual meeting of stockholders approximately 95 of the votes cast at the 2011 annual meeting approved the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement delivered to our stockholders in connection with the 2011 annual meeting we understood this to mean that stockholders generally approved of our compensation policies and determinations in 2011 as a result following review and consultation with aonradford consulting “aonradford” which has been retained by the compensation committee to advise the compensation committee on executive compensation matters and taking into consideration evolving best practices in executive compensation by public companies we have not made any significant changes to our executive compensation decisions and policies the compensation committee periodically reviews the goals we would like to achieve through our executive compensation practices and explores ways to modify those practices to either achieve new goals or to enhance our ability to achieve existing goals 

what are the objectives of our compensation program 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

1 ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

2 providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

3 providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving financial performance targets 

4 providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders and rewards them for increases in stockholder value and 

5 ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all of our employees 

how do we determine the components and amount of compensation to pay   

the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford to assist the compensation committee in determining the components and amount of executive compensation the consultant reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience individual performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally take into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2011 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 27 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data — for example for a vpgeneral manager position — the comparator group data reflected survey data regarding hightechnology companies which included a larger survey sample and ii the public “peer” group data for 17 publiclytraded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 



utilization of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards in addition in setting fiscal year 2011 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of each executive 

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii the chief executive officer’s role relative to the other named executive officers iv input from the full board of directors on the chief executive officer’s performance and v the considerable length of his 17year service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation for 2011 were competitive for chief executive officers in the sector the chief executive officer was not present during the voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers 

what are the components of executive compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits and medical and insurance benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical or insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by its consultant based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2011 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary for the named executive officers for fiscal year 2011 increased on average 34 from their base salaries in 2010 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2011 the compensation committee adopted the 2011 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance metrics established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentives are intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance metrics that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in establishing the shortterm incentive plan the compensation committee first determined a competitive shortterm incentive target for each named executive officer based on the comparator group data and then set threshold target and maximum incentive payment levels at the target payout level skyworks’ shortterm incentive was designed to result in an incentive payout equal to the median of the comparator group while a maximum incentive payout for exceeding the performance metrics would result in a payout above the median of the comparator group and a threshold payout for meeting the minimal corporate performance metrics would result in a payout below the median the following table shows the incentive payment levels the named executive officers could earn in fiscal year 2011 shown as a percentage of base salary depending on the company’s 

achievement of the performance metrics 



when determining the final amount of the incentive payout to the extent that actual performance falls between the threshold and the target metrics or between the target and maximum metrics the actual incentive payout was determined based on a linear sliding scale 

for fiscal year 2011 in establishing the incentive plan the compensation committee considered the fact that for the first half of fiscal 2011 our primary corporate goal was to increase revenue in excess of the market growth rate by gaining market share while at the same time leveraging our fixed cost structure to generate higher earnings as in fiscal year 2010 for fiscal year 2011 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two six month performance periods with the performance metrics focused on achieving revenue nongaap gross margin and specified nongaap operating margin targets in addition to cash customer satisfaction and units shipped metrics the weighting of the different metrics for the first half of fiscal year 2011 for each named executive officer was as follows 



for the first half of fiscal 2011 each executive officer’s incentive award was consistent with the metrics set forth above with the company only making payments for the performance metrics established by the compensation committee that were achieved accordingly the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 50 of his annual base salary at target for the first half and the vicepresident and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 35 of his annual base salary at target for the first half earned a first half incentive award equal to approximately 96 61 69 69 and 61 of his annual base salary respectively the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash as permitted by the incentive plan unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officer’s first half shortterm incentive earned above the target level accordingly the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and the senior vice president worldwide operations received approximately 48 43 49 50 and 43 of their respective first half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company in addition in recognition of their contributions to the company’s performance during the first half of fiscal 2011 the compensation committee approved payments to approximately 800 other nonexecutive employees pursuant to nonexecutive incentive plans which plans have terms and conditions similar to the incentive plan consistent with the incentive plan and the other employee incentive plans actual payments for the first six month performance period were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year since the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal year 2011 

for the second half of fiscal year 2011 the committee again established performance metrics based on achieving specified revenue nongaap gross margin and nongaap operating margin targets as well as customer satisfaction and product design win metrics the weighting of the different metrics for the second half of fiscal year 2011 for each named executive officer was as follows 



in determining the weightings among the named executive officers the compensation committee’s goal was to align the incentive compensation of each named executive officer with the performance metrics such executive could most impact for instance the performance metrics for the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer and senior vice president worldwide operations were designed to focus such executives on improving the company’s competitive position and achieving profitable growth overall the performance metrics for the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions and executive vice president and general manager high performance analog were designed to focus such executive on business unit performance ie securing design wins for new products and expansion of the customer base 

in the second half of the year each executive officer’s incentive award was consistent with the metrics set forth above with the company only making payments for the performance metrics established by the compensation committee that were achieved accordingly the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 50 of his annual base salary at target for the second half and the vicepresident and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 35 of his annual base salary at target for the second half earned a second half incentive award equal to approximately 54 36 23 43 and 43 of his annual base salary respectively the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash as permitted by the incentive plan unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officer’s second half shortterm incentive earned above the target level accordingly the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and the senior vice president worldwide operations each received approximately 8 4 0 18 and 18 of their respective second half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company in addition the 20 “holdback” of the first half incentive was paid out to each executive officer after the end of the fiscal year due to the company’s sustained financial performance 

for the full fiscal year the total payments under the incentive plan to the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 100 of his annual base salary at target for the year and the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions the executive vice president and general manager high performance analog and the senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 70 of his annual base salary at target for the year earned approximately 150 98 92 112 and 104 of his annual base salary respectively 

the target financial performance metrics established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on our historical operating results and growth rates as well as our expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum financial performance metrics established by the committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the committee believes should be rewarded the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes 

it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive awards in extraordinary circumstances 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes longterm stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis longterm stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with stockholders and reward them for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2011 the compensation committee made awards to executive officers including certain named executive officers on november 9 2010 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the meeting date 

in making stockbased compensation awards to certain executive officers for fiscal year 2011 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the outstanding number of shares that are typically used for employee compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of skyworks shares of common stock that would be made available for executive officer awards at approximately the median of the comparator group based on the business need internal and external circumstances and riskmetricsiss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers the compensation committee then attributed a longterm equitybased compensation value to each executive officer forty percent 40 of that value was converted to a number of stock options using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining sixty percent 60 of the value was converted to a number of performance share awards based on the fair market value of the common stock and an assumption that the company would achieve the targeted level of performance required to earn the performance share award the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding performance shares is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equityawards that will vest only if the company achieves preestablished performance metrics 

other compensation and benefits 

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical plans dental plans vision plans life insurance plans and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any serp or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees in fiscal year 2011 the company offered executives the opportunity to participate in financial planning services through ayco at a cost of 13000 per executive paid by the company other than mr freyman none of the named executive officers elected to participate in the companypaid program although mr aldrich receives financial planning services from ayco he personally pays for such services 

although certain named executive officers were historically provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” — an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation — as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so 

severance and change of control benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations and in connection with terminations under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms of our severance and change of control arrangements with the named executive officers can be found under the “potential payments upon   termination or change of control” section below 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance 

and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the change in control context severance benefits are payable to the named executive officers if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause or if a named executive officer terminates his own employment for a good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and targeted shortterm incentive opportunity or past shortterm incentive earned 

additionally the named executive officers would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if their employment terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail under the “potential payments upon termination   or change of control” section below the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the 20 golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes the company further believes these enhanced severance benefits are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of each named executive officer and these enhanced severance protections encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the change in control process 

lastly each named executive officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards if any fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control in addition each outstanding performance share award shall be deemed earned as to the greater of a the “target” level or b the number of shares that would have been deemed earned under the award as of the day prior to the change in control the company believes this accelerated vesting is appropriate given the importance of longterm equity awards in our executive compensation program and the uncertainty regarding the continued employment of named executive officers that typically occurs in a change in control context the company’s view is that this vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company and encourages the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process

on june 4 2009 each named executive officer had the opportunity to forfeit an outstanding performance share award dated november 6 2007 that such executive had previously been granted the “2007 psa” and receive in its place the following equity awards 

1 a restricted stock award the “2009 replacement rsa” covering shares equal to the “thresholdnominal” tranche of shares of the company’s common stock that could be earned under the executive’s 2007 psa which shares would vest on or about november 6 2010 provided the named executive officer continued his employment with the company through such date and 

2 an irc section 162m compliant performance share award the “2009 replacement psa” and together with the 2009 replacement rsa the “2009 replacement awards” pursuant to which the executive would receive a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the aggregate amount of the “target” and “maximumstretch” tranches of shares of the company’s common stock that could be earned under the 2007 psa if certain conditions are satisfied 

each of the named executive officers accepted the company’s offer and agreed to have his 2007 psa cancelled and replaced with the 2009 replacement awards the maximum number of shares issued under the 2009 replacement awards for each named executive officer on june 10 2009 was equal to the maximum number of shares that would have been issuable to such executive under his cancelled 2007 psa the 2009 replacement awards consisted of a the 2009 replacement rsas that vested on november 6 2010 as follows mr aldrich 150000 shares mr palette 17500 shares mr waters 20000 shares mr griffin 50000 shares and mr freyman 25000 shares and b the 2009 replacement psas as follows which represents the number of shares that could have been received under each such executive’s 2007 psa if the “maximumstretch” tranches of shares were earned mr aldrich 300000 shares mr palette 35000 shares mr waters 40000 shares mr griffin 100000 shares and mr freyman 50000 shares the 2009 replacement psas had both “relative stock performance” and “continued employment” conditions that had to be met in order for the executive to receive any shares underlying the award the “relative stock performance” condition provided that if the percentage change in the price of skyworks’ common stock as compared to a “peer group” of companies during a specified “measuring period” exceeded the 60th percentile of such peer group then the “target” price level change would have been met and 50 of the total shares covered by the psa would be earned subject to the continued employment condition if the percentage change in the price of skyworks’ common stock exceeded the 70th percentile of the peer group then the “maximum” price level change would have been met and 100 of the shares subject to the psa would be earned subject to the continued employment condition the percentage change in the price of the common stock of the company as well as each member of the peer group during the measurement period was determined by comparing x the average of such entity’s stock price for the ninety 90 day period beginning on november 6 2007 to y the average of the entity’s stock price for the ninety 90 day period ending on november 6 2010 for purposes of calculating the average price of the common stock of an entity during such ninety 90 day periods only “trading days” days on which the nasdaq global select market is open for trading were used in such calculation and trading volume on any such trading day was not factored into such calculation for purposes of the 2009 replacement psas the “measurement period” was deemed to have started on november 6 2007 and ended on november 6 2010 the “continued employment” condition provided that if the relative stock price performance condition is met for either the “target” or “maximum” level then 50 of the total shares for which the relative stock price performance metric was met would be issuable to the executive on or about november 6 2010 and the other 50 of such total shares would be issuable to the executive on or about november 6 2011 provided that the executive is employed with skyworks through such dates in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability after the measurement date of a 2009 replacement psa but before shares are issued the holder or his or her estate would receive the number of shares that would have been issuable thereunder based on the actual performance of the company in november 2010 the company determined that the change in the price of the company’s common stock had exceeded the 70th percentile of its peer group and as a result the “maximum” relative stock performance level had been met and therefore 100 of the shares subject to the psa were eligible for issuance subject to the continued employment condition on each of november 6 2010 and november 6 2011 the company issued onehalf of each executive’s earned shares since each executive met the continued employment condition

compensation discussion and analysis 

  who sets compensation for senior executives 

the compensation committee which is comprised solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “irc” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and each of our other executive officers as well as any other officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal 2010 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers”

  what are the objectives of our compensation program 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include

 1 ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

 2 providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

 3 providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving financial performance targets 

 4 providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders and rewards them for increases in stockholder value and 

 5 ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all of our employees 

  how do we determine the components and amount of compensation to pay 

the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent

  retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting to assist the compensation committee in determining the components and amount of executive compensation the consultant reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations

    role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience individual performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally takes into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives

  establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2010 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 30 semiconductor companies where sufficient data was not available in the aonradford semiconductor survey data — for example for a vpgeneral manager position — the comparator group data reflected survey data regarding hightechnology companies which included a larger survey sample semiconductor companies included in the survey had average annual revenue of approximately 1 billion whereas the hightechnology companies included in the survey were segregated based on the annual revenue of the general manager’s business unit  and ii the public “peer” group data for 15 publiclytraded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent the “peer group”

 

  utilization of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards in addition in setting fiscal year 2010 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of the executive

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii the chief executive officer’s role relative to other named executive officers and iv the considerable length of his 16year service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation for 2010 were competitive for chief executive officers in the sector the chief executive officer was not present during voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers

    what are the components of executive compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits and medical and insurance benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical or insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees

  base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by its consultant based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2010 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary increase for the named executive officers for fiscal year 2010 was on average 35 given the significant changes in the economic environment and the uncertainty in financial markets in the first half of fiscal 2010 however the compensation committee determined to delay implementing the recommended base salary increases until the second half of fiscal 2010 after it became clear that the company’s business had stabilized

  shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2010 the compensation committee adopted the 2010 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance metrics established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentives are intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance metrics that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in establishing the shortterm incentive plan the compensation committee first determined a competitive shortterm incentive target for each named executive officer based on the comparator group data and then set threshold target and maximum incentive payment levels at the target payout level skyworks’ shortterm incentive was designed to result in an incentive payout equal to the median of the comparator group while a maximum incentive payout for exceeding the performance metrics would result in a payout above the median of the comparator group and a threshold payout for meeting the minimal corporate performance metrics would result in a payout below the median the following table shows the incentive payment levels the named executive officers could earn in fiscal year 2010 shown as a percentage of base salary depending on the company’s achievement of the performance metrics actual performance between the threshold and the target metrics or between the target and maximum metrics was determined based on a linear sliding scale

 

for fiscal year 2010 in establishing the incentive plan the compensation committee considered the fact that for the first half of fiscal 2010 our primary corporate goal was to increase revenue in excess of the market growth rate by gaining market share while at the same time leveraging our fixed cost structure to generate higher earnings as in the prior year for fiscal year 2010 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two six month performance periods with the performance metrics focused on achieving revenue nongaap gross margin and specified nongaap operating margin targets in addition to a cash customer satisfaction and units shipped metric the weighting of the different metrics for the first half of fiscal year 2010 is set forth as follows

   

for the first half of fiscal 2010 each executive officer’s incentive award was consistent with the metrics set forth above with the company only making payments for the performance metrics that were achieved accordingly the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 50 of his annual base salary at target for the first half and the vicepresident and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 30 of his annual base salary at target for the first half earned a first half incentive award equal to approximately 94 57 42 42 and 57 of his annual base salary respectively the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officer’s first half shortterm incentive earned above the target level accordingly the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and the senior vice president worldwide operations received approximately 47 47 28 29 and 47 of their respective first half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company in addition in recognition of their contributions to the company’s performance during the first half of fiscal 2010 the compensation committee approved payments to approximately 800 other nonexecutive employees under nonexecutive incentive plans containing terms and conditions similar to the incentive plan consistent with the incentive plan and other employee incentive plans actual payments for the first six month performance period were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year since the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal year 2010

for the second half of fiscal year 2010 the committee again established performance metrics based on achieving specified revenue and unit shipments nongaap gross margin nongaap operating margin targets and a cash and customer satisfaction metric the weighting of the different metrics for the second half of fiscal year 2010 is set forth as follows

   

in determining the weightings among the named executive officers the compensation committee’s goal was to align the incentive compensation of each named executive officer with the performance metrics such executive could most impact for instance the performance metrics for the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer and senior vice president worldwide operations were designed to focus such executives on improving the company’s competitive position and achieving profitable growth overall the performance metrics for the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions were designed to focus such executive on business unit performance ie the ramping of new products and expansion of the customer base and the performance metrics for the senior vice president sales and marketing were designed to focus such executive on increasing revenue while at the same time increasing gross margin

in the second half of the year the company met or exceeded its targets accordingly the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 50 of his annual base salary at target for the second half and the vicepresident and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 30 of his annual base salary at target for the second half earned a second half incentive award equal to approximately 87 52 56 53 and 48 of his annual base salary respectively the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officer’s second half shortterm incentive earned above the target level accordingly the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and the senior vice president worldwide operations each received approximately 43 43 47 44 and 37 of their respective second half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company in addition the 20 “holdback” of the first half incentive was paid out to each executive officer due to the company’s sustained financial performance

for the full fiscal year the total payments under the incentive plan to the chief executive officer who was eligible to earn 100 of his annual base salary at target for the year and the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions the senior vice president sales and marketing and the senior vice president worldwide operations each of whom was eligible to earn 60 of his annual base salary at target for the year earned approximately 182 109 98 96 and 104 of his annual base salary respectively

  the target financial performance metrics established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on our historical operating results and growth rates as well as our expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum financial performance metrics established by the committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the committee believes should be rewarded the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive awards in extraordinary circumstances

  longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with stockholders and reward them for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2010 the compensation committee made awards to executive officers including certain named executive officers on november 10 2009 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the meeting date

in making stockbased compensation awards to certain executive officers for fiscal year 2010 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the outstanding number of shares that are typically used for employee compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of skyworks shares of common stock that would be made available for executive officer awards at approximately the median of the comparator group based on the business need internal and external circumstances and riskmetricsiss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers the compensation committee then attributed a longterm equitybased compensation value to each executive officer onehalf of that value was converted to a number of stock options using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining half of the value was converted to a number of performance share awards at target based on the fair market value of the common stock the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding performance shares is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equityawards that will vest only if the company achieves a preestablished performance metrics

  other compensation and benefits 

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical plans dental plans vision plans life insurance plans and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any serp or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees

although certain named executive officers were historically provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” — an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation — as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so

    severance and change of control benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations and in connection with terminations under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms of our severance and change of control arrangements with the named executive officers can be found under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the change in control context severance benefits are payable to the named executive officers if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause or if a named executive officer terminates his own employment for a good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and targeted shortterm incentive opportunity or past shortterm incentive earned

additionally the named executive officers would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if their employment terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the 20 golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 280g of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes the company further believes these enhanced severance benefits are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of each named executive officer and these enhanced severance protections encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the change in control process

lastly each named executive officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control in addition each outstanding performance share award shall be deemed earned as to the greater of a the “target” level or b the number of shares that would have been deemed earned under the award as of the day prior to the change in control the company believes this accelerated vesting is appropriate given the importance of longterm equity awards in our executive compensation program and the uncertainty regarding the continued employment of named executive officers that typically occurs in a change in control context the company’s view is that this vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company and encourages the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

  who sets compensation for senior executives 

the compensation committee which is comprised solely of independent directors within the meaning of applicable nasdaq rules outside directors within the meaning of section 162 of the internal revenue code “section 162m” and nonemployee directors within the meaning of rule 16b3 under the exchange act is responsible for determining all components and amounts of compensation to be paid to our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and each of our other executive officers as well as any other officers or employees who report directly to the chief executive officer 

this compensation discussion and analysis section discusses the compensation policies and programs for our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three next most highly paid executive officers during fiscal 2009 as determined under the rules of the sec we refer to this group of executive officers as our “named executive officers” 

  what are the objectives of our compensation program 

the objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives to operate our business and to link the compensation of those executives to improvements in the company’s financial performance and increases in stockholder value accordingly the compensation committee’s goals in establishing our executive compensation program include 

 1 ensuring that our executive compensation program is competitive with a group of companies in the semiconductor industry with which we compete for executive talent 

 2 providing a base salary that serves as the foundation of a compensation package that attracts and retains the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives 

 3 providing shortterm variable compensation that motivates executives and rewards them for achieving financial performance targets 

 4 providing longterm stockbased compensation that aligns the interest of our executives with stockholders and rewards them for increases in stockholder value and 

 5 ensuring that our executive compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all of our employees 

  how do we determine the components and amount of compensation to pay 

the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting to assist the compensation committee in determining the components and amount of executive compensation the consultant reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

 

the compensation committee also considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations include an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience individual performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally takes into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2009 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 45 semiconductor companies 1 and ii the public “peer” group data for 14 publiclytraded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent the “peer group” 

 

  utilization of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards in addition in setting fiscal year 2009 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established and the full board of directors was advised of the base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of the executive  

in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills necessary to ensure our continued growth and success iii the chief executive officer’s role relative to other named executive officers and iv the considerable length of his 15year service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation for 2009 were competitive for chief executive officers in the sector the chief executive officer was not present during voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers

  what are the components of executive compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits and medical and insurance benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical or insurance benefits to named executive officers that are different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

  base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by its consultant based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2009 were generally targeted at the comparator group median with consideration given to role responsibility performance and length of service after taking these factors into account the base salary increase for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2009 was approximately 4 with the exception of the chief financial officer who received a 10 increase in order to bring his base salary closer to the median 

 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2009 the compensation committee adopted the 2009 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance metrics established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentives are intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance metrics that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in establishing the shortterm incentive plan the compensation committee first determined a competitive shortterm incentive target for each named executive officer based on the comparator group data and then set threshold target and maximum incentive payment levels at the target payout level skyworks’ shortterm incentive was designed to result in an incentive payout equal to the median of the comparator group while a maximum incentive payout for exceeding the performance metrics would result in a payout above the median of the comparator group and a threshold payout for meeting the minimal corporate performance metrics would result in a payout below the median the following table shows the incentive payment levels the named executive officers could earn in fiscal year 2009 shown as a percentage of base salary depending on the company’s achievement of the performance metrics actual performance between the threshold and the target metrics or between the target and maximum metrics was determined based on a linear sliding scale 

 

for fiscal year 2009 in establishing the incentive plan the compensation committee considered the fact that for the first half of fiscal 2009 our primary corporate goal was to increase revenue in excess of the market growth rate by gaining market share while at the same time leveraging our fixed cost structure to generate higher earnings as in the prior year for fiscal year 2009 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two six month performance periods with the performance metrics focused on achieving business unit revenue nongaap gross margin and specified nongaap operating margin targets in addition to a cash and customer satisfaction metric the weighting of the different metrics for the first half of fiscal year 2009 is set forth as follows 

 

for the first half of fiscal 2009 each executive officer’s incentive award was consistent with the metrics set forth above although the compensation committee exercised discretion permitted by the plan to make such award payments by waiving the minimum operating income margin metric given that the company nearly achieved such objective despite the severe and unanticipated economic downturn that occurred during the first half of fiscal 2009 the company only made payments for the performance metrics that were achieved and no payment was made based on the operating income margin metric accordingly the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and vice president worldwide operations earned a first half incentive award equal to approximately 14 8 14 26 and 11 of their annual base salary respectively in addition in recognition of their contributions to the company’s performance during the first half of fiscal 2009 the compensation committee approved payments to approximately 800 other nonexecutive employees under nonexecutive incentive plans containing terms and conditions similar to the incentive plan consistent with the incentive plan and other employee incentive plans actual payments for the first six month performance period were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year since the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal year 2009 

for the second half of fiscal year 2009 the committee again established performance metrics based on achieving specified revenue nongaap gross margin nongaap operating margin targets and a cash and customer satisfaction metric the weighting of the different metrics for the second half of fiscal year 2009 is set forth as follows 

 

in determining the weightings among the named executive officers the compensation committee’s goal was to align the incentive compensation of each named executive officer with the performance metrics such executive could most impact for instance the performance metrics for the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer and vice president worldwide operations were designed to focus such executives on improving the company’s competitive position and achieving profitable growth overall the performance metrics for the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions were designed to focus such executive on business unit revenue ie the ramping of new products and expansion of the customer base and the performance metrics for the senior vice president sales and marketing were designed to focus such executive on increasing overall corporate revenue while at the same time increasing gross margin 

in the second half of the year the company met or exceeded its targets accordingly the chief executive officer vice president and chief financial officer executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and vice president worldwide operations earned a second half incentive award equal to approximately 95 57 57 57 and 57 of their annual base salary respectively the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officer’s second half shortterm incentive earned above the “target” level accordingly the chief executive officer the vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions senior vice president sales and marketing and the vice president worldwide operations each received approximately 47 of their respective second half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company in addition the 20 “holdback” of the first half incentive was paid out to each executive officer due to the company’s sustained financial performance 

for the full fiscal year the total payments under the incentive plan to the chief executive officer vicepresident and chief financial officer the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions the senior vice president sales and marketing and the vice president worldwide operations were approximately 109 65 71 83 and 68 of their respective annual base salaries 

the target financial performance metrics established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on our historical operating results and growth rates as well as our expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum financial performance metrics established by the committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the committee believes should be rewarded the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive awards in extraordinary circumstances such as existed during the severe and unanticipated economic downturn that occurred during the first half of fiscal 2009 

  longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee generally makes stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with stockholders and reward them for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2009 the compensation committee made awards to executive officers including certain named executive officers on november 4 2008 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the meeting date 

in making stockbased compensation awards to certain executive officers for fiscal year 2009 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the outstanding number of shares that are typically used for employee compensation programs the compensation committee then set the number of skyworks shares of common stock that would be made available for executive officer awards at approximately the median of the comparator group based on the business need internal and external circumstances and riskmetricsiss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers the compensation committee then attributed a longterm equitybased compensation value to each executive officer onehalf of that value was converted to a number of stock options using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining half of the value was converted to a number of performance share awards at target based on the fair market value of the common stock the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding performance shares is to further align the executive’s interest with those of the company’s stockholders by using equityawards that will vest only if the company achieves a preestablished performance metrics 

in addition given the significant changes in the economic environment and the financial markets in the first half of fiscal 2009 and that certain previously granted performance share awards were not exempt from the deduction limitations under section 162m on june 4 2009 the company gave each of its executive officers including the named executive officers the opportunity to forfeit an outstanding performance share award dated november 6 2007 such executive had previously been granted the “2007 psa” and receive in its place the following equity awards 

1 a restricted stock award the “2009 replacement rsa” covering shares equal to the “thresholdnominal” tranche of 

shares of the company’s common stock that could be earned under the executive’s 2007 psa which shares will vest on november 6 2010 provided that the executive continues employment with the company through such date and 

2 a section 162m compliant performance share award the “2009 replacement psa” and together with the 2009 replacement rsa the “2009 replacement awards” pursuant to which the executive will receive a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the aggregate amount of the “target” and “maximumstretch” tranches of shares of the company’s common stock that could be earned under the 2007 psa if certain conditions are satisfied the conditions that must be satisfied are as follows 

 a relative stock price performance condition 

the “target” relative stock price condition which covers 50 of the underlying shares shall be deemed met on november 6 2010 if the percentage change in the price of skyworks’ common stock exceeds the 60th percentile of the peer group 1 during the measurement period the “stretch” relative stock price condition which covers 50 of the underlying shares shall be deemed met on november 6 2010 if the percentage change in the price of skyworks’ common stock exceeds the 70th percentile of the peer group during the measurement period for purposes of the 2009 replacement psa the “measurement period” was deemed to have started on november 6 2007 and will end on november 6 2010 

 b continued employment condition 

if the relative stock price performance condition is met for either the “target” or “stretch” tranche or both then 50 of the total shares for which the relative stock price performance metric was met would be issuable to the executive on november 6 2010 and the other 50 of such total shares would be issuable to the executive on november 6 2011 provided that the executive is employed with skyworks through such dates 

each of the named executive officers accepted the company’s offer and agreed to have his 2007 psa cancelled and replaced with the 2009 replacement awards the maximum number of shares issued under the 2009 replacement awards for each named executive officer on june 10 2009 is equal to the maximum number of shares that would have been issuable to such executive under his cancelled 2007 psa 

 

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical plans dental plans vision plans life insurance plans and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any serp or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees 

although certain named executive officers were historically provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” — an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation — as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the internal revenue code “irc” effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so 

 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations and in connection with terminations under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms 

 

 10 

of our severance and change of control arrangements with the named executive officers can be found under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the change in control context severance benefits are payable to the named executive officers if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause or if a named executive officer terminates his own employment for a good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason on or after january 1 2010 the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to his respective annual base salary and targeted shortterm incentive opportunity or past shortterm incentive earned 

additionally the named executive officers would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if their employment terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company these benefits are described in detail under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section below the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the 20 golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 280g of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes the company further believes these enhanced severance benefits are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of each named executive officer and these enhanced severance protections encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the change in control process 

lastly each named executive officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control in addition each outstanding performance share award shall be deemed earned as to the greater of a the “target” level or b the number of shares that would have been deemed earned under the award as of the day prior to the change in control the company believes this accelerated vesting is appropriate given the importance of longterm equity awards in our executive compensation program and the uncertainty regarding the continued employment of named executive officers that typically occurs in a change in control context the company’s view is that this vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their equity awards because of a change in control of the company and encourages the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the process

the compensation committee sets compensation for the named executive officers including salary shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased awards at levels generally intended to be competitive with the compensation of comparable executives in semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

retention of compensation consultant 

the compensation committee has engaged aonradford consulting to assist the compensation committee in determining the components and amount of executive compensation the consultant reports directly to the compensation committee through its chairperson and the compensation committee retains the right to terminate or replace the consultant at any time the consultant advises the compensation committee on such compensation matters as are requested by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers the consultant’s advice on such matters in addition to any other information or factors it considers relevant in making its compensation determinations 

role of chief executive officer 

the compensation committee also considered the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of each of his direct reports including the other named executive officers these recommendations included an assessment of each individual’s responsibilities experience individual performance and contribution to the company’s performance and also generally took into account internal factors such as historical compensation and level in the organization in addition to external factors such as the current environment for attracting and retaining executives 

establishment of comparator group data 

in determining compensation for each of the named executive officers the committee utilizes “comparator group” data for each position for fiscal year 2008 the compensation committee approved comparator group data consisting of a 5050 blend of i aonradford survey data of 93 semiconductor companies 1 and ii the public “peer” group data for 14 publiclytraded semiconductor companies with which the company competes for executive talent 

 

  

   

utilization of comparator group data 

the compensation committee annually compares the components and amounts of compensation that we provide to our chief executive officer and other named executive officers with the components and amounts of compensation provided to their counterparts in the comparator group and uses this comparison data as a guideline in its review and determination of base salaries shortterm incentives and longterm stockbased compensation awards in addition in setting fiscal year 2008 compensation the compensation committee sought and received input from its consultant regarding the base salaries for the chief executive officer and each of his direct reports the award levels and performance targets relating to the shortterm incentive program for executive officers and the individual stockbased compensation awards for executive officers as well as the related vesting schedules 

after reviewing the data and considering the input the compensation committee established a base salary shortterm incentive target and longterm stockbased compensation award for each named executive officer in establishing individual compensation the compensation committee also considered the input of the chief executive officer as well as the individual experience and performance of the executive in determining the compensation of our chief executive officer our compensation committee focused on i competitive levels of compensation for chief executive officers who are leading a company of similar size and complexity ii the importance of retaining a chief executive officer with the strategic financial and leadership skills to ensure our continued growth and success iii the chief executive officer’s role relative to other named executive officers and iv the considerable length of his 14year service to the company aonradford advised the compensation committee that the base salary annual performance targets and shortterm incentive target opportunity and equitybased compensation for 2008 were competitive for chief executive officers in the sector the chief executive officer was not present during voting or deliberations of the compensation committee concerning his compensation as stated above however the compensation committee did consider the recommendations of the chief executive officer regarding the compensation of all of his direct reports including the other named executive officers 

what are the components of executive compensation 

the key elements of compensation for our named executive officers are base salary shortterm incentives longterm stockbased incentives 401k plan retirement benefits medical and insurance benefits consistent with our objective of ensuring executive compensation is perceived as fair to all employees the named executive officers do not receive any retirement benefits beyond those generally available to our fulltime employees and we do not provide medical or insurance benefits to named executive officers that are significantly different from those offered to other fulltime employees 

base salary 

base salaries provide our executive officers with a degree of financial certainty and stability the compensation committee determines a competitive base salary for each executive officer using the comparator group data and input provided by its consultant based on these factors base salaries of the named executive officers were generally targeted at the comparator group median and in certain instances were targeted closer to the 75th percentile based on role responsibility performance and length of service after considering all these factors base salary adjustments ranges from 0 to 7 with the average base salary adjustment made for named executive officers for fiscal year 2008 being 37 

shortterm incentives 

our shortterm incentive compensation plan for executive officers is established annually by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2008 the compensation committee adopted the 2008 executive incentive plan the “incentive plan” the incentive plan established shortterm incentive awards that could be earned semiannually by certain officers of the company including the named executive officers based on the company’s achievement of certain corporate performance metrics established on a semiannual basis shortterm incentives are intended to motivate and reward executives by tying a significant portion of their total compensation to the company’s achievement of preestablished performance metrics that are generally shortterm ie less than one year in establishing the shortterm incentive plan the compensation committee first determined a competitive shortterm 

  

incentive target for each named executive officer based on the comparator group data and then set threshold target and maximum incentive payment levels at the target payout level skyworks’ shortterm incentive was designed to result in an incentive payout equal to the median of the comparator group while a maximum incentive payout for exceeding the corporate performance metrics would result in a payout above the median of the comparator group and a threshold payout for meeting the minimal corporate performance metrics would result in a payout below the median the following is the incentive payment levels the named executive officers could earn in fiscal year 2008 shown as a percentage of base salary depending on the company’s achievement of the performance metrics actual performance between the threshold and the target metrics or between the target and maximum metrics was determined based on a linear sliding scale 

 

 for fiscal year 2008 in establishing the incentive plan the compensation committee considered the fact that our primary corporate goal was to increase revenue in excess of the market growth rate by gaining market share while at the same time leveraging our fixed cost structure to generate higher earnings as in the prior year for fiscal year 2008 the compensation committee split the incentive plan into two six month performance periods with the performance metrics focused on achieving corporate revenue nongaap gross margin and specified nongaap operating income targets in addition to a cash and customer satisfaction quality metric the weighting of the different metrics for the first half of fiscal year 2008 is set forth as follows 

 

 because the company exceeded each of its target performance metrics for the first half of the year the chief executive officer earned a first half incentive award equal to approximately 89 of his annual base salary and each of the other named executive officers earned a first half incentive award equal to approximately between 50 to 57 of his respective annual base salary in accordance with the provisions of the incentive plan incentive payments for the first six month performance period were capped at 80 of the award earned with 20 of the award earned held back until the end of the fiscal year to ensure sustained financial performance the amount held back was subsequently paid after the end of the fiscal year as the company sustained its financial performance throughout fiscal year 2008 

for the second half of fiscal year 2008 the committee again established performance metrics based on achieving specified revenue nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income targets and a cash and customer satisfaction quality metric the weighting of the different metrics for the second half of fiscal year 2008 is set forth as follows 

 

   

in determining the weightings among the named executive officers the compensation committee’s goal was to align the incentive compensation of each named executive officer with the performance metrics such executive could most impact for instance the performance metrics for the chief executive officer chief financial officer and vice president worldwide operations were designed to focus such executives on improving the company’s competitive position and achieving profitable growth overall the performance metrics for the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions were designed to focus such executive on business unit revenue ie the ramping of new products and expansion of the customer base and the performance metrics for the senior vice president sales and marketing were designed to focus such executive on increasing overall corporate revenue while at the same time increasing gross margin 

in the second half of the year the company met or exceeded its targets accordingly the chief executive officer earned a second half incentive award equal to approximately 93 of his annual base salary and the other named executive officers earned second half incentive awards ranging from approximately 49 to 56 of their respective annual base salaries the compensation committee determined to pay in lieu of cash unrestricted common stock of the company for the portion of each of the named executive officers second half shortterm incentive earned above the “target” level accordingly the chief executive officer the chief financial officer the vice president worldwide operations the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions and senior vice president sales and marketing received approximately 46 46 39 42 and 46 of their respective second half incentive payments in the form of unrestricted common stock of the company 

for the full fiscal year the total payments under the incentive plan to the chief executive officer chief financial officer the vice president worldwide operations the executive vice president and general manager frontend solutions and senior vice president sales and marketing were approximately 182 109 99 109 and 108 of their respective annual base salaries 

the target financial performance metrics established by the compensation committee under the incentive plan are based on our historical operating results and growth rates as well as our expected future results and are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and the company the maximum financial performance metrics established by the committee have historically been difficult to achieve and are designed to represent outstanding performance that the committee believes should be rewarded the compensation committee retains the discretion based on the recommendation of the chief executive officer to make payments even if the threshold performance metrics are not met or to make payments in excess of the maximum level if the company’s performance exceeds the maximum metrics the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to retain this discretion in order to make shortterm incentive awards in extraordinary circumstances no such discretion was exercised under the incentive plan for fiscal year 2008 

longterm stockbased compensation 

the compensation committee makes stockbased compensation awards to executive officers on an annual basis stockbased compensation awards are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with stockholders and reward them for increases in stockholder value over long periods of time ie greater than one year it is the company’s practice to make stockbased compensation awards to executive officers in november of each year at a prescheduled compensation committee meeting for fiscal year 2008 the compensation committee made awards to executive officers including certain named executive officers on november 6 2007 at a regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting stock options awarded to executive officers at the meeting had an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the meeting date 

in making stockbased compensation awards to certain executive officers for fiscal year 2008 the compensation committee first reviewed the comparator group data to determine the percentage of the outstanding number of shares that are typically used for employee compensation programs ie “burn rate” and “overhang” the compensation committee then set the number of skyworks shares of common stock that would be made available for executive officer awards at approximately the median of the comparator group based on the business need internal and external circumstances and riskmetricsiss guidelines the compensation committee then reviewed the comparator group by executive position to determine the allocation of the available shares among the executive officers the compensation committee then attributed a longterm equitybased compensation value to each executive officer onehalf of that value was converted to a number of stock options using an estimated blackscholes value and the remaining half was converted to a number of restricted stock awards based on the fair market value of the common stock the compensation committee’s rationale for awarding restricted shares included providing an award that would have a fixed monetary value for retention purposes while at the same time providing an incentive to the executive management team towards the common goal of increasing stockholder value the restricted stock granted in november 2007 contained both performance and service vesting conditions as described in footnote 3 of the “ grant of planbased awards table ” below 

  

in addition in order to increase retention and at the same time further align the interest of our executives with stockholders and reward them for significant increases in stockholder value over time the compensation committee awarded performance share awards under the company’s 2005 longterm incentive plan in november 2007 to certain employees including the named executive officers receipt of these performance shares is tied to three 3 stock price appreciation targets to be achieved during a threeyear performance period ending on november 6 2010 specifically one third 13 of the total performance shares will be earned upon each incremental twenty percent 20 increase in the company’s stock price over the 60day trading average of the company’s common stock immediately preceding the date of grant the “base price” such that one hundred percent 100 of the total performance shares would be earned if the company’s stock price based on a rolling 60day trading average increases at least sixty percent 60 over the base price during the performance period in addition an executive must continue service through the end of the performance period in order to receive any performance shares if the stock price does not increase at least twentypercent 20 over the base price during the performance period no shares will be issuable pursuant to an award 

other compensation and benefits 

we also provide other benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and are not tied to any company performance criteria consistent with the compensation committee’s goal of ensuring that executive compensation is perceived as fair to all stakeholders the company offers medical plans dental plans vision plans life insurance plans and disability insurance plans to executive officers under the same terms as such benefits are offered to all other employees additionally executive officers are permitted to participate in the company’s 401k savings and investment plan and employee stock purchase plan under the same terms as all other employees the company does not provide executive officers with any enhanced retirement benefits ie executive officers are subject to the same limits on contributions as other employees as the company does not offer any serp or other similar nonqualified deferred compensation plan and they are eligible for 401k companymatch contributions under the same terms as other employees 

although certain named executive officers were historically provided an opportunity to participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” — an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants were allowed to defer a portion of their compensation — as a result of deferred compensation legislation under section 409a of the irc effective december 31 2005 the company no longer permits employees to make contributions to the plan although the company had discretion to make additional contributions to the accounts of participants while the executive compensation plan was active it never did so 

severance and change of control benefits 

none of our executive officers including the named executive officers has an employment agreement that provides a specific term of employment with the company accordingly the employment of any such employee may be terminated at any time we do provide certain benefits to our named executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations and in connection with terminations under certain circumstances following a change of control a description of the material terms of our severance and change of control arrangements with the named executive officers can be found under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section of the proxy statement 

the company believes that severance protections can play a valuable role in recruiting and retaining superior talent severance and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to incent them to forego an opportunity with another company these agreements also protect the company as the named executive officers are bound by restrictive noncompete and nonsolicit covenants for two years after termination of employment outside of the change in control context severance benefits are payable to the named executive officers if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause or if a named executive officer terminates his own employment for a good reason as defined in the agreement in addition provided he forfeits certain equity awards and agrees to serve on the company’s board of directors for a minimum of two 2 years the chief executive officer is entitled to certain severance benefits upon termination of his employment for any reason on or after january 1 

  

2010 the compensation committee believes that this provision facilitates his retention with the company the level of each named executive officer’s severance or other termination benefit is generally tied to their respective annual base salary and targeted shortterm incentive opportunity or past shortterm incentive earned 

additionally the named executive officers would receive enhanced severance and other benefits if their employment terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control of the company which benefits are described in detail under the “potential payments upon termination or change of control” section of the proxy statement below the named executive officers are also entitled to receive a tax grossup payment with a 500000 cap for named executive officers other than the chief executive officer if they become subject to the 20 golden parachute excise tax imposed by section 280g of the irc as the company believes that the executives should be able to receive their contractual rights to severance without being subject to punitive excise taxes the company further believes these enhanced severance benefits are appropriate because the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction would likely create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of each named executive officer and these enhanced severance protections encourage the named executive officers to remain employed with the company through the change in control process and to focus on enhancing stockholder value both before and during the change in control process 

lastly each named executive officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards fully vest upon the occurrence of a change in control the company believes this accelerated vesting is appropriate given the importance of longterm equity awards in our executive compensation program and the uncertainty regarding the continued employment of named executive officers that typically occurs in a change in control context the company’s view is that this vesting protection helps assure the named executive officers that they will not lose the expected value of their options and restricted stock awards because of a change in control of the company

skyworks solutions inc a delaware corporation was formed through the merger of the wireless business of conexant systems inc and alpha industries inc on june 25 2002 

headquartered in woburn massachusetts we have worldwide operations with engineering manufacturing sales and service facilities throughout asia europe and north america our internet address is wwwskyworksinccom we make available on our website our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k section 16 filings on forms 3 4 and 5 and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically submit such material to the sec the information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report you may read and copy materials that we have filed with the sec at the sec public reference room located at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 please call the sec at 1800sec0330 for further information on the public reference room our sec filings are also available to the public on the sec’s internet website at wwwsecgov 

industry background 

we believe there are two major trends in the wireless industry that are shaping the market landscape and the way in which original equipment manufacturers “oems” engage semiconductor suppliers first there is a market share consolidation underway by virtually all analyst estimates approximately 80 percent of the handset market is now controlled by the five largest oems who are increasingly leveraging their brand manufacturing and distribution advantages across network carriers worldwide 

second and perhaps even more dramatic is the convergence of multimediarich mobile platforms and the increasingly important role of multimode fems in the rapidly evolving wireless handset market — particularly as the industry shifts to 3g technology enabling applications such as web browsing video streaming gaming mp3 players and cameras in fact next generation edge wedge and wcdma wireless platforms will soon become the majority of the more than one billion cellular phones the industry is expected to produce annually with this accelerating trend the complexity in the fem increases as each new operating frequency band requires additional amplifier filtering and switching content to support 

 

 

convergence of multimedia in mobile platforms 

further given constraints on handset size and power consumption these complex modules must remain physically small energy efficient and cost effective while also managing an unprecedented level of potential signal interference within the handset as a result addressable semiconductor content within the transmit and receive chain portion of the cellular handset is expected to more than double over the next several years creating an incremental market opportunity measured in billions of dollars during that time 

meanwhile outside of the handset market wireless technologies are rapidly proliferating as they tend to be the critical link between the analog and digital worlds precision analog technology allows for the detection measurement amplification and conversion of temperature pressure and audio information into the digital realm according to independent market research the total available market for the analog semiconductor segment is expected to approach 45 billion in 2011 today this adjacent analog semiconductor market which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and relatively high gross margins is fragmented and diversified among various endmarkets customer bases and applications 

select analog end markets 

skyworks’ strategy 

skyworks’ vision is to become the leading supplier of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity key elements in our strategy include 

diversifying into adjacent linear markets of skyworks 

by leveraging core analog mixed signal and rf technology skyworks is also able to deliver solutions to broader and diverse markets that are characterized by longer product lifecycles sustained revenue profiles and higher contribution margins than our handset business while the addressable market for linear products is highly fragmented it is significantly larger than the cellular handset rf industry 

expanding power amplifier and frontend solutions market share 

our products offer customers solutions that significantly speed timetomarket while significantly reducing bill of material costs power consumption and footprints we plan to increase our current worldwide market share position through higher levels of integration and continued innovation leveraging our leading–edge process and packaging technologies 

capturing increasing dollar content in third and fourth generation applications 

as the industry migrates to multimode edge wedge wcdma and wimax architectures rf complexity in the transmit and receive chain substantially increases given simultaneous voice and high speed data communications requirements coupled with the need for backward compatibility to existing networks as a result we believe the addressable market for our solutions will more than double over the next several years 

partnering with the world’s leading baseband suppliers 

as a result of exiting the baseband business at the end of fiscal 2006 we are now effectively partnering with rather than competing against systemlevel developers we believe these strategic relationships will enhance our competitive position as the market migrates to 3g multimode and systemonachip architectures where bestinclass baseband radio and frontend solutions are increasingly required 

delivering operational excellence 

skyworks’ strategy is to vertically integrate where we can differentiate or otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leadingedge capabilities these partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership and competitive advantage in the marketplace we are focused on achieving the industry’s shortest cycle times highest yields and ultimately the lowest product cost structure 

business framework

the skyworks advantage 

by turning complexity into simplicity we provide our customers with the following competitive advantages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing and distribution 

our products are primarily sold through a direct skyworks sales force this team is globally deployed across all major market regions in some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent manufacturers’ representatives assuring broader coverage of territories and customers we also utilize distribution partners some of which are franchised globally with others focused in specific regional markets eg europe north america china and taiwan 

we maintain an internal marketing organization that is responsible for developing sales and advertising literature print media such as product announcements and catalogs as well as a variety of webbased content skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a customer design we strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the inception of a new program this relationship allows our team to facilitate customerdriven solutions which leverage the unique strength of our product portfolio while providing high value and greatly reducing timetomarket 

we believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an extraordinary commitment to maintain intimate ongoing relationships with our customers as such we strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design engineering manufacturing purchasing and project management we also employ a collaborative approach in developing these relationships by combining the support of our design teams applications engineers manufacturing personnel sales and marketing staff and senior management 

we believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to provide worldclass sales and service support by listening and responding to feedback we are able to mobilize resources to raise the level of customer satisfaction improve our ability to anticipate future product needs and enhance our understanding of key market dynamics we are confident that diligence in following this path will position skyworks to participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future 

revenues from and dependence on customers customer concentration 

for information regarding customer concentration and revenues from external customers for each of the last three fiscal years see note 17 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

we own or are licensed under numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products our manufacturing operations and processes and other activities in addition we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services we believe that intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies devices algorithms and processes we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies devices algorithms or processes in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and effective copyright patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions in addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain crosslicenses of intellectual property from others to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us furthermore in our linear products business we seek to generate high gross margin revenue through the sale and license of noncore intellectual property and we on occasion purchase intellectual property to support our core business due to rapid technological changes in the industry we believe that establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel 

competitive conditions 

we compete on the basis of timetomarket new product innovation overall product quality and performance price compliance with industry standards strategic relationships with customers and protection of our intellectual property certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers resellers suppliers or other third parties these relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we might not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 

research and development 

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies our research and development expenditures for fiscal years ended october 3 2008 september 28 2007 and september 29 2006 were 1460 million 1261 million and 1641 million respectively 

raw materials 

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources we do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders however we have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities we request these raw materials and take title to them as they are needed in our manufacturing process we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels we also maintain skyworksowned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations we do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the skyworksowned inventory from these hub locations 

environmental regulations 

federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

most of our european customers have mandated that our products comply with local and regional lead free and other “green” initiatives we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

seasonality 

sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets the highest demand for our mobile handset products generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december the lowest demand for our mobile handset products generally occurs in the first calendar quarter ending in march 

geographic information 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years see note 17 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k risks attendant to our foreign operations are discussed in item 1arisk factors 

employees 

as of october 3 2008 we employed approximately 3300 persons approximately 500 of our employees in mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations financial condition or results from operations

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

we operate primarily in the wireless semiconductor industry which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for enduser products in both the consumer and enterprise markets recently deteriorating economic conditions worldwide together with other factors such as the unprecedented volatility of the financial markets and liquidity concerns make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such uncertainty and economic weakness continues the market for wireless semiconductor products is likely to contract and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations for our current fiscal year would likely be materially and adversely affected such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand manufacturing overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices furthermore downturns in the wireless semiconductor industry may be prolonged and any extended delay or failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year 

we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 

in the past weak global economic conditions have led to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog and higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue these factors contributed to operating losses for our business in the past additionally we have incurred operating losses in connection with the restructuring of our business for example we had operating losses of 663 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the exit of our baseband product area while we had positive operating results during fiscal years 2007 and 2008 we may experience future losses as a result of a significant downturn in the economy as a result of corporate restructuring activities as a result of market factors beyond our control or as a result of a combination of the foregoing 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

 

the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future 

the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

 

public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility this volatility has significantly and negatively affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies including the market price of our common stock these broad market fluctuations may further materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods 

in addition fluctuations in our stock price volume of shares traded and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction our company has been and in the future may be the subject of commentary by financial news media such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts the financial news media or investors our stock price may decline possibly substantially over a short period of time 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share including rf micro devices anadigics and triquint semiconductor as we continue to expand in the linear products markets we will compete with companies in other industries including analog devices hittite microwave linear technology and maxim integrated products 

we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 

 

we might not be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 

 

as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and in particular the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change continuous product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration increased miniaturization reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors including 

 

 

our ability to manufacture current products and to develop new products depends among other factors on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems or it systems 

we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface if we fail to rapidly and costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers requirements our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 

in addition prices of many of our products decline sometimes significantly over time we cannot assure you that our products will not become obsolete earlier than planned or have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products accordingly we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

if oems and original design manufacturers or odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products are not sold directly to the enduser but are components or subsystems of other products as a result we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders the potential liabilities associated with these and similar provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at significant amounts or are uncapped these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls or other 

obligations under customer contracts which may adversely impact our operating results if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may result from electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism health advisories or risks or other natural or manmade disasters as well as equipment maintenance repairs andor upgrades such as the conversion to a 6” wafer manufacturing line currently in process at our newbury park california facility disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

 

although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly 

since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

although we own and operate a test and assembly facility we still depend on subcontractors to package assemble and test certain of our products at costcompetitive rates we do not have longterm agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties suffers any damage to its facilities experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner andor at costcompetitive rates due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components any problems that we may encounter with the delivery quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations we are continuing to develop relationships with additional thirdparty subcontractors to assemble and test our products however even if we use these new subcontractors we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components can result in tighter supplies we cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our delivery schedules that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or that we will be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost if a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities if we were to lose this sole source of supply for any reason a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained to the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products our business could be materially and adversely affected sales to our three largest oem customers in fiscal 2008 sony ericsson mobile communication ab semc samsung and asian information technology inc ait including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors in the case of semc and samsung represented approximately 40 of our net revenues for fiscal 2008 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may not be able to effectively operate our business 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and therefore we cannot assure 

you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance andor declines in the price of our common stock given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for nonreturnable products could be impaired 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it 

any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we or one of our customers were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

in addition if another supplier to one of our customers or a customer of ours itself were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture import use sale or offer for sale of its infringing products or process es either of which could result indirectly in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products if such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business could be adversely affected 

we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

 

despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion even if we receive a patent the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology furthermore even if we receive patent protection in the united states we may not seek or may not be granted patent protection in foreign countries in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

we attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational technological and legal safeguards despite our efforts parties including former or current employees may attempt to copy disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization furthermore attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations while we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 

a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states primarily in countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

 

 

 

additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

to the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis if at all failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on october 3 2008 we had total indebtedness of approximately 1876 million which represented approximately 173 of our total capitalization after the close of fiscal year 2008 we retired 405 million in aggregate principal amount of our 125 and 150 convertible notes although our cash and cash equivalents balance currently exceeds our total indebtedness we have long term debt obligations that mature in 2010 and 2012 and we may require additional financing prior to such dates in order to allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures acquisitions working capital and other cash requirements particularly if our shortterm revolving credit facility were not renewed 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

 

despite our current debt levels we believe we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

accounting rule changes for certain convertible debt instruments will alter trends established in previous periods 

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  this fsp alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements specifically it will significantly increase the noncash interest expense associated with our existing 125 and 150 convertible notes and previously held 475 convertible notes including interest expense in prior periods the exact impact of this proposal to the company’s financial statements is currently being evaluated the company is not required to adopt fsp apb 141 until the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

increasingly stringent environmental laws rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to costeffectively produce our products 

the electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances a number of which have been used in our products or processes for example the european union restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the rohs directive while we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible or may only be available from a single source or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts additionally if we were found to be noncompliant with any such rule or regulation we could be subject to fines penalties andor restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states and in foreign countries we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities furthermore our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain 

competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

to be successful we may need to effect investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire 

although we have invested in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

 

moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

 

 

in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been and may in the future be instituted or asserted against the company including those pertaining to patent infringement intellectual property environmental product liability safety and health employment and contractual matters 

additionally the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and 

other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the company intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which if imposed against the company could materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

from time to time we are a party in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we believe that there is no such ordinary course litigation pending that will have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business

basis of presentation 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2008 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on october 3 2008 the extra week occurred in the fourth quarter and the company does not believe it had a material impact on its results from operations fiscal years 2007 and 2006 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 28 2007 and september 29 2006 respectively 

results of operations 

years ended october 3 2008 september 28 2007 and september 29 2006 

the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 

general 

during fiscal 2008 certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations more specifically 

 

net revenues 

 

we market and sell our mobile platforms and linear products to top tier original equipment manufacturers “oems” of communication electronic products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors we periodically enter into strategic arrangements leveraging our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our patents or other intellectual property we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 

overall revenues in fiscal 2008 increased by 1183 million or 159 from fiscal 2007 this revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platform products the addition of new mobile platform customers diversification into new adjacent markets and the expansion of our market share in increasingly complex frontend modules at our existing customers net revenues from our top three customers decreased to 435 for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 as compared to 485 for the corresponding period in the prior year reflecting continued 

expansion of our customer base average selling prices declined 66 year over year compared to a decline of 81 in the prior year 

overall revenues in fiscal 2007 declined by 320 million or 41 from fiscal 2006 due to the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal year 2006 revenues from our mobile platforms and linear product areas remained relatively unchanged over that same period we experienced a more favorable product mix in fiscal 2007 which was offset by a decline in average selling prices of 81 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years see note 17 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross profit 

 

gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation and equity based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to 399 in fiscal year 2008 from 387 in fiscal year 2007 and was principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix additionally gross profit margin improved as a result of higher equipment efficiencies at all of our factories as our established hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries allows us to maintain high internal capacity utilization by using secondsources for high fixed cost services like foundry and assembly this approach provides supply chain flexibility lower capital investment the ability to meet upside demand and provides cost advantages furthermore yield improvements and yearoveryear material cost reductions along with the increased overall revenue contributed to the gross profit and margin improvement in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2008 we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing andor sale of intellectual property 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to 387 in fiscal year 2007 from 339 in fiscal year 2006 as higher gross profit margin mobile platforms and linear products became a greater percentage of our overall net revenues since we exited the lower margin baseband product area at the end of fiscal 2006 additionally inventory related charges recorded in fiscal 2006 related to the exit of our baseband product area did not recur in fiscal 2007 furthermore we improved absorption as our factory utilization increased and we experienced improved overall yields and greater equipment efficiency finally we benefited from higher contribution margins received from the licensing and sale of intellectual property in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 

research and development 

 

research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 

the increase in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 when compared to fiscal year 2007 is principally attributable to increased labor and benefit costs and increases in elot and mask expenditures and variable materials and supplies expenses as we continued to invest in new product developments in both our mobile platforms and linear product areas 

the decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 is predominantly attributable to decreased labor and benefit costs as a result of the workforce reductions associated with the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal 2006 in addition efficiencies were achieved in the utilization of outside services fixed materials and supplies rent costs relocation costs business travel and hardwaresoftware costs the reductions in the labor intensive research and development costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area enabled us to refocus enhance and target our research and development spending on our higher growth core product areas in fiscal year 2007 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service bad debt expense sales representative commissions advertising marketing and other costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher sharebased compensation expense higher incentive compensation costs and higher sales commissions selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of the overall increase in net revenues along with selling general and administrative costs increasing at a lower rate than the revenue growth rate 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to our recording of 351 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as we exited our baseband product area in addition we incurred lower sales commissions and professional fees in fiscal 2007 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

the increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is due to the acquisitions completed in october 2007 and the associated amortizable customer relationships patents order backlog foundry services agreement and developed technology that were acquired in fiscal 2008 the gross of our amortizable intangible assets increased by approximately 132 million 

in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark acquired by the company these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense in fiscal 2007 and 2006 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 

for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets see note 7 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring and special charges 

 

restructuring and special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities as follows 

on september 29 2006 the company exited its baseband product area in order to focus on its mobile platforms and linear product areas the company recorded various charges associated with this action 

during the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 we recorded 131 million related to severance and benefits 74 million related to the writedown of technology licenses and design software 42 million related to the impairment of certain longlived assets and 23 million related to other charges 

during the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 we recorded additional restructuring charges of 49 million related to the exit of the baseband product area these charges consist of 45 million relating to the exit of certain operating leases 05 million relating to additional severance 14 million related to the writeoff of technology licenses and design software offset by a 15 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve originally recorded to account for an engineering vendor charge associated with the exit of the baseband product area in addition the company recorded an additional 08 million charge for a single lease obligation that expires in 2008 relating to our 2002 restructuring 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 additional restructuring charges of 06 million were recorded relating to lease obligations due to the closure of certain locations that formerly supported the baseband product area 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances see note 15 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is comprised principally of payments in connection with the 500 million credit facility between skyworks usa inc our wholly owned subsidiary and wachovia bank na “facility agreement” the company’s 475 convertible subordinated notes the “junior notes” and the company’s 125 and 150 convertible subordinated notes the “2007 convertible notes” 

the decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the retirement of the remaining 493 million of higher interest rate junior notes during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the early retirement of 624 million of the company’s 2007 convertible notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

the decrease in interest expense both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the retirement of 1300 million of our higher interest rate junior notes coupled with the issuance of the substantially lower interest rate 2007 convertible notes in march 2007 

for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 8 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

loss on early retirement of convertible debt 

 

in september 2008 we retired 500 million and 124 million of our 2007 convertible notes due in 2010 and 2012 respectively we recorded a loss of 68 million during the three months and fiscal year ended october 3 2008 related to the early retirement of these notes approximately 58 million of this charge represents a premium paid to retire the notes and 10 million of the charge represents a writeoff of deferred financing costs 

other income net 

 

other income net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances other nonoperating income and expense items and foreign exchange gainslosses 

the decreases in other income in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is due to an overall decline in interest income on invested cash balances due to lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 

the increase in other income net between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is primarily due to an increase in interest income on invested cash balances as a result of increased interest rates and higher invested cash balances 

benefit provision for income taxes 

 

income tax benefit for fiscal 2008 was 288 million as compared to 09 million benefit for fiscal 2007 income tax benefit expense for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 consists of approximately 282 million and 22 million respectively of united states income tax benefit the fiscal 2008 benefit of 282 million is due to a 364 million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards us income tax expense of 12 million and a charge in lieu of tax expense of 70 million the charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of acquisition the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill the fiscal 2007 united states income tax benefit of 22 million is due to a 17 million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating carryforwards and the reversal of 05 million of tax reserve no longer required the income tax provision for fiscal 2006 was comprised of a favorable adjustment of 01 million between fiscal 2005’s tax provision and tax return liability and foreign tax expense of 155 million 

the provision benefit for foreign income taxes for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 was 06 million 13 million and 155 million respectively the foreign tax benefit for fiscal 2008 included a reversal of 10 million of reserves for tax uncertainties that are no longer required foreign tax expense for fiscal 2006 included a one time charge of 146 million to write off a deferred tax asset as a result of reorganizing our mexico business 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109” management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized accordingly as of october 3 2008 we have established a valuation allowance of 829 million of which 816 million relates to our united states deferred tax assets and 13 million relates to our foreign operations 

realization of the company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating taxable income in the future the company considered several factors in evaluating the company’s capacity to generate future earnings skyworks has produced a strong earnings trend generating cumulative earnings of 662 million in fiscal years 2006 through 2008 in addition 2008 revenue increased 159 over 2007 and gross profit as a percentage of sales has improved in the last three years based on the aforementioned positive factors skyworks projected future earnings to determine the realizability of our income tax benefit our projections considered the business uncertainty resulting from the current economic crisis market forecasts and the cyclical nature of our business based on the company’s evaluation of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets through the generation of future income 400 million of the company’s valuation allowance was reversed at october 3 2008 the amount reversed consisted of 364 million recognized as income tax benefit and 36 million recognized as a reduction to goodwill the remaining valuation allowance as of october 3 2008 is 829 million when recognized the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows approximately 714 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit 76 million will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill and 39 million will be recognized as an increase to shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options 

the company will continue to evaluate its valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the outcome of that assessment additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense such adjustments could cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods we will need to generate 3272 million of future united states federal taxable income to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and deferred income tax temporary differences as of october 3 2008 

no provision has been made for united states state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 89 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

on september 29 2007 the company adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this statement also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in the interim periods disclosure and transition the provisions of fin 48 will be applied to all income tax provisions commencing from that date 

during the year ended october 3 2008 the statute of limitations period expired relating to an unrecognized tax benefit the expiration of the statute of limitations period resulted in the recognition of 10 million of previously unrecognized tax benefit including accrued interest on our tax position which impacted the effective tax rate as a discrete item including this reversal total yeartodate accrued interest related to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits was a benefit of 04 million 

of the total unrecognized tax benefits at october 3 2008 06 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized there are no positions which we anticipate could change within the next twelve months 

on october 1 2007 mexico enacted a new “flat tax” regime which became effective january 1 2008 sfas 109 prescribes that the effect of the new tax on deferred taxes must be included in tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date the effect of recording deferred taxes in the first fiscal quarter of 2008 to the foreign tax provision benefit was 02 million in addition to the deferred taxes the company has accrued flat tax for the year ended october 3 2008 of 03 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

fiscal 2008 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2008 along with current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms if at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected

cash and cash equivalent balances decreased 165 million to 2251 million at october 3 2008 from 2416 million at september 28 2007 we generated 1737 million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 which was offset by the retirement of 493 million of junior notes 624 million of the 2007 convertible notes capital expenditures of 648 million and expenditures on acquisitions of 326 million the number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 decreased to 57 from 80 for fiscal 2007

in connection with our exit of the baseband product area we anticipate making remaining cash payments of approximately 24 million in future periods certain payments on severance and longterm lease obligations resulting from facility closures will be remitted primarily in fiscal 2009 

our invested cash balances primarily consist of united states treasury obligations united states agency obligations overnight repurchase agreements backed by united states treasuries or united states agency obligations highly rated commercial paper and certificates of deposit at october 3 2008 we also held a 32 million auction rate security which historically has provided liquidity through a dutch auction process the recent disruptions in the credit markets have substantially eliminated the liquidity of this process resulting in failed auctions during the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 we performed a comprehensive valuation and discounted cash flow analysis on the auction rate security we concluded the value of the auction rate security was 23 million and the carrying value of these securities was reduced by 09 million reflecting this change in fair value accordingly in the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 we recorded unrealized losses on this auction rate security of approximately 09 million we assessed these declines in fair market value to be temporary and consider the security to be illiquid until there is a successful auction accordingly the remaining auction rate security balance has been reclassified to noncurrent other assets and the loss has been recorded in other comprehensive income we will continue to monitor the liquidity and accounting classification of this security in future periods if in a future period we determine that the impairment is other than temporary we will impair the security to its fair value and charge the loss to earnings 

after the close of fiscal 2008 we retired an additional 405 million of our 2007 convertible notes due in 2012 at an average discounted price of 9258 per 10000 of par value these retirements reduced the remaining principal balance on our 2007 convertible notes to 971 million as of november 12 2008

 critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue from license fees and intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable and all other criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 

revenue recognition  have been met we ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market the company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the recoverability of inventories is assessed through an ongoing review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of twelve months the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 

once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required some or all of the inventories that have been writtendown may be retained and made available for sale in the event that actual demand is higher than originally projected a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the future inventories that have been writtendown and are identified as obsolete are generally scrapped 

sharebased compensation 

the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options employee stock purchases related to the company’s 2002 employee stock purchase plan restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of october 1 2005 the first day of the company’s fiscal year 2006 

sharebased compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of sharebased payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period sharebased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 included compensation expense for sharebased payment awards granted on or before but not yet vested as of september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas 123 and compensation expense for the sharebased payment awards granted subsequent to september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r as sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates

upon adoption of sfas 123r the company elected to retain its method of valuation for sharebased awards using the blackscholes optionpricing model “blackscholes model” which was also previously used for the company’s pro forma information required under sfas 123 the company’s determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes model is affected by the company’s stock price 

as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors for more complex awards with marketbased performance conditions the company employs a monte carlo simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome 

sfas 123r requires the company to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in conjunction with calculating sharebased compensation expense these assumptions include the expected life of a stock option or other equity based award expected volatility prevesting forfeiture risk free rate and expected dividend yield all of these assumptions affect to one degree or another the valuation of the company’s equity based awards or the recognition of the resulting sharebased compensation expense the most significant assumptions in the company’s calculations are described below 

expected life of an option or other equity based award 

since employee options are nontransferable sfas 123r allows the use of an expected life to more accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual term 

the vesting of the majority of the company’s stock options are graded over four years 25 at each anniversary and the contractual term is either 7 years or 10 years the company analyzed its historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group the company analyzed the following three exercise metrics exercise at full vesting exercise at midpoint in the contractual life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term the company chose the midpoint alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of its employee population the valuation and resulting sharebased compensation expense recorded is sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could result in a material difference in the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

expected volatility 

expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period sfas 123r does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life implied volatilities the length of time a stock has been publicly traded regular intervals for price observations corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion the company analyzed its volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of 50 to historical volatility and 50 to implied volatility as measured by examining the underlying volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options would provide the best estimate of expected future volatility of the stock price the selection of another methodology to calculate volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

prevesting forfeiture 

sfas 123r specifies that initial accruals of sharebased compensation expense should be based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered the company examined its options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture percentage the company determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience the application of a different methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

valuation of longlived assets 

carrying values for longlived assets and definite lived intangible assets which excludes goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that the carrying amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to the company’s business model or changes in its operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group the company recognizes an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company’s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value the company calculates fair value using the average market price of its common stock over a sevenday period surrounding the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the annual impairment test the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter if the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the company performs step two step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess intangible assets are tested for impairment using an estimate of discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

income taxes 

the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the carrying value of the company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company’s consolidated statement of operations management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly likewise in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period such determination was made 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations with the implementation effective september 29 2007 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is more likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit and the extent to which additional taxes would be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to foreign currency market rate and interest risks as described below 

investment and interest rate risk 

our exposure to interest and market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio which as of october 3 2008 consisted of the following in thousands 

 

our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital our policy is to invest with only highcreditquality issuers and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments we are however subject to overall financial market risks such as changes in market liquidity credit quality and interest rates  

available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period contractual maturities exceed ten years in fiscal 2008 we experienced a temporary unrealized loss on our investment in auction rate securities primarily caused by a disruption in the liquidity of the dutch auction process which resets interest rates each month we classified auction rate securities in prior periods as current assets under “short term investments” in fiscal 2008 we determined the fair value of our auction rate securities to be 23 million given the failed auctions the auction rate securities are effectively illiquid until there is a successful auction accordingly the remaining auction rate securities balance has been reclassified to noncurrent other assets we believe we have the ability to hold these investments until the lack of liquidity in these markets is resolved or they mature if current market conditions deteriorate further we may be required to record additional unrealized losses if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur or we need funds from the auctionrate securities to meet working capital needs we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through impairment charges recorded to earnings as appropriate which could be material 

our shortterm debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na of 500 million interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na is at libor plus 075 and was approximately 47 at october 3 2008 consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on this shortterm debt

our longterm debt at november 12 2008 consists of 971 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes “2007 convertible notes” these 2007 convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the company’s common stock exceed 952 it has been the company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future including settlement of the 2007 convertible notes issued in march 2007 these shares have not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended october 3 2008 as their effect would have been antidilutive exchange rate risk 

substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs for the fiscal years ended october 3 2008 september 28 2007 and september 29 2006 the company incurred unrealized foreign exchange gainslosses of 06 million 04 million and 01 million respectively increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies

skyworks a delaware corporation was formed through the merger of the wireless business of conexant systems inc and alpha industries inc on june 25 2002 

headquartered in woburn massachusetts we are worldwide with engineering manufacturing sales and service facilities throughout asia europe and north america our internet address is wwwskyworksinccom we make available on our website our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k section 16 filings on forms 3 4 and 5 and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically submit such material with the securities and exchange commission “sec” the information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report 

industry background 

we believe there are two major trends in the wireless industry that are shaping the market landscape and the way in which original equipment manufacturers “oems” engage semiconductor suppliers first there is a market share consolidation underway by virtually all analyst estimates approximately 80 percent of the handset market is now controlled by the five largest oems who are increasingly leveraging their brand manufacturing and distribution advantages across network carriers worldwide 

second and perhaps even more dramatic is the convergence of multimediarich mobile platforms and the increasingly important role of multimode fems in the rapidly evolving wireless handset market — particularly as the industry shifts to 3g technology enabling applications such as cameras mp3 players video streaming gaming web browsing and wifi based 80211 wireless data in fact next generation edge wedge and wcdma wireless platforms are driving strong market unit growth and in 2008 are expected to be the majority of the more than one billion cellular phones the industry is expected to produce with this accelerating trend the complexity in the fem increases as each new operating frequency band requires additional amplifier filtering and switching content to support 

 

 

convergence of multimedia in mobile platforms 

further given constraints on handset size and power consumption these complex modules must remain physically small energy efficient and cost effective while also managing an unprecedented level of potential signal interference within the handset as a result addressable semiconductor content within the transmit and receive chain portion of the cellular handset is expected to more than double over the next several years creating an incremental market opportunity measured in billions of dollars 

meanwhile outside of the handset market wireless technologies are rapidly proliferating as they are the critical link between the analog and digital worlds precision analog technology allows for the detection measurement amplification and conversion of temperature pressure and audio information into the digital realm according to the semiconductor industry association the total available market for the analog semiconductor segment is expected to approach 50 billion in 2009 today this adjacent analog semiconductor market which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and relatively high gross margins is fragmented and diversified among various endmarkets customer bases and applications 

select analog end markets 

skyworks’ strategy 

skyworks’ vision is to become the leading supplier of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity key elements in our strategy include 

expanding power amplifier and frontend solutions market share 

our products offer customers solutions that significantly speed timetomarket while dramatically reducing bill of material costs power consumption and footprints we plan to increase our current worldwide market share position through higher levels of integration and continued innovation leveraging our leading edge process and packaging technology 

capturing increasing dollar content in third and fourth generation applications 

as the industry migrates to multimode edge wedge wcdma and wimax architectures rf complexity in the transmit and receive chain substantially increases given simultaneous voice and high speed data communications requirements coupled with the need for backward compatibility to existing networks as a result skyworks believes that the addressable semiconductor market for our solutions more than doubles 

gaining market share with helios™ rf solutions 

we continue to expand our radio presence with the helios™ platform which bundles our single chip direct conversion transceiver and frontend module skyworks is now supporting multiple tier one handset oems with complete radios and we look forward to even greater traction as we launch our differentiated wcdma solutions in the coming year 

partnering with the world’s leading baseband suppliers 

as a result of exiting the baseband business at the end of fiscal 2006 we are now effectively partnering with versus competing against systemlevel developers we believe these strategic relationships will enhance our competitive position as the market migrates to 3g multimode and systemonachip architectures where bestinclass baseband radio and frontend solutions are increasingly required 

diversifying into adjacent linear markets 

by leveraging core analog mixed signal and rf technology skyworks is also able to deliver solutions to broader and diverse markets that are characterized by longer product lifecycles sustained revenue profiles and higher contribution margins than our handset business while the addressable market for linear products is highly fragmented it is significantly larger than the cellular handset rf industry 

delivering operational excellence 

skyworks’ strategy is to vertically integrate where we can differentiate or otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leadingedge capabilities these partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership and competitive advantage in the marketplace we are focused on achieving the industry’s shortest cycle times highest yields and ultimately the lowest product cost structure 

business framework 

we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products

linear products 

 

we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios in the industry 

the skyworks advantage 

by turning complexity into simplicity we provide our customers with the following competitive advantages 

 

marketing and distribution 

our products are primarily sold through a direct skyworks sales force this team is globally deployed across all major market regions in some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent manufacturers’ representatives assuring broader coverage of territories and customers we also utilize distribution partners some of which are franchised globally with others focused in specific regional markets eg europe north america china and taiwan 

we maintain an internal marketing organization that is responsible for developing sales and advertising literature print media such as product announcements and catalogs as well as a variety of webbased content skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a customer design we strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the inception of a new program this partnership allows our team to facilitate customerdriven solutions which leverage the unique strength of our portfolio while providing high value and greatly reducing timetomarket 

we believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an extraordinary commitment to close ongoing relationships with our customers as such we strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design engineering manufacturing purchasing and project management we also employ a collaborative approach in developing these partnerships by combining the support of our design teams applications engineers manufacturing personnel sales and marketing staff and senior management 

we believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to provide worldclass sales and service support by listening and responding to feedback we are able to mobilize actions to raise the level of customer satisfaction improve our ability to anticipate future product needs and enhance our understanding of key market dynamics we are confident that diligence in following this path will position skyworks to participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future 

revenues from and dependence on customers customer concentration 

for information regarding customer concentration and revenues from external customers for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

we own or are licensed under numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products our manufacturing operations and processes and other activities in addition we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services we believe that intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies devices algorithms and processes we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies devices algorithms or processes in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and effective copyright patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions in addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain crosslicenses of intellectual property from others to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us furthermore in our linear products business we generate high gross margin revenue through the sale and license of noncore intellectual property and we on occasion purchase intellectual property to support our core business due to rapid technological changes in the industry we believe that establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel 

competitive conditions 

we compete on the basis of timetomarket new product innovation overall product quality and performance price compliance with industry standards strategic relationships with customers and protection of our intellectual property certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers resellers suppliers or other third parties these relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 

research and development 

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies our research and development expenditures for fiscal years ended september 28 2007 september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 were 1261 million 1641 million and 1522 million respectively 

raw materials 

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources we do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders however we have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities we request these raw materials 

and take title to them as they are needed in our manufacturing process we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels we also deliver product to certain external customer “hubs” consignment where our significant customers will pull inventory from their existing consignment inventories when required these consignment pulls result in the recognition of revenue and we periodically replenish these inventory levels 

environmental regulations 

federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims has been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

most of our european customers have mandated that our products comply with local and regional lead free and other “green” initiatives we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

cyclicality seasonality 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change product obsolescence price erosion evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand these and other factors together with changes in general economic conditions may cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business we have experienced periods of industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these factors may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

sales of our products are also subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets this generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the end of the calendar year 

geographic information 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

employees 

as of september 28 2007 we employed approximately 3300 persons approximately 550 employees in mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract motivate develop and retain highly skilled and dedicated employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

certain business risks 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect our future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards from time to time changes in general economic conditions together with other factors cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these characteristics and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations furthermore downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity and materials constraints which may affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 

in the past global economic conditions led to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions these factors contributed to operating losses for our business in the past additionally we have incurred operating losses in connection with the restructuring of our business for example we had operating losses of 663 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the exit of our baseband product area 

while we had positive operating results during fiscal year 2007 we may experience future losses as a result of downturns in the economy as a result of corporate restructuring activities or as a result of market factors beyond our control 

additionally the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts natural disasters acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest contributes to the economic uncertainty these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen or both our business financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share including rf micro devices anadigics and triquint semiconductor as we expand in the linear products market we will compete with companies in other industries including analog devices hittite microwave linear technology and maxim integrated products 

we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 

we might not be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 

as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share furthermore some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufacture products similar to ours and may compete with us we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing 

pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to pay warranty claims replace products or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer’s products containing our parts 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may result from electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism health advisories or risks or other natural or manmade disasters as well as equipment maintenance repairs andor upgrades disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

• the lack of ensured wafer supply potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices 

• limited control over delivery schedules manufacturing yields production costs and quality assurance and 

• the inaccessibility of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 

although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

although we own and operate a test and assembly facility we still depend on subcontractors to package assemble and test certain of our products we do not have longterm agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties suffers any damage to its facilities experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components any problems that we may encounter with the delivery quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations we are continuing to develop relationships with additional thirdparty subcontractors to assemble and test our products however even if we use these new subcontractors we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs recent increased demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components has resulted in tighter supplies we cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our delivery schedules that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications if a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities if we were to lose this sole source of supply for any reason a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained to the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products our business could be materially and adversely affected sales to our three largest oem customers in fiscal 2007 sony ericsson mobile communication ab motorola inc and samsung including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors represented approximately 50 of our net revenues for fiscal 2007 although we expect that our 

largest oem customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in fiscal 2008 a large customer of ours recently experienced reduced demand for its products a sustained decrease in orders from this customer could materially and adversely affect our results from operations 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and in particular the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration increased miniaturization and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors including 

• the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards 

• the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand 

• the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements 

• the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis 

• the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors 

• overall market acceptance of our products and 

• the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products 

our ability to manufacture current products and to develop new products depends among other factors on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems or it systems 

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface if we fail to rapidly and costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 

in addition prices of many of our products decline sometimes significantly over time we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change if we are not able to adapt to changes our products may become obsolete 

the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics 

• rapid technological developments and product evolution 

• rapid changes in customer requirements 

• frequent new product introductions and enhancements 

• demand for higher levels of integration decreased size and decreased power consumption 

• short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product and 

• evolving industry standards 

these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the abovenoted factors 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may not be able to effectively operate our business 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

if oems and original design manufacturers or odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products are not sold directly to the enduser but are components or subsystems of other products as a result we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom have rights to return unsold products we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for nonreturnable products could be impaired 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on september 28 2007 we had total indebtedness of approximately 2993 million which represented approximately 303 of our total capitalization we retired the remaining 493 million in aggregate principal amount of the junior notes plus 12 million in accrued and unpaid interest on the due date of november 15 2007 

we may require additional funding prior to the date that we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments to allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures acquisitions debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements if necessary among other alternatives we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other longterm debt lines of credit and other financing 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete and 

• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 

despite our current debt levels we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

proposed accounting rule changes for certain convertible debt instruments could alter trends established in previous periods 

on august 31 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued proposed fsp apb 14a for a 45day comment period that ended on october 15 2007 that if adopted would alter the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements 

specifically it could significantly increase the noncash interest expense associated with our existing 200 million 2007 convertible notes including interest expense in prior periods the exact impact of this proposal to the company’s financial statements will not be known until such time that the proposal is finalized 

average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short if we are unable to sell our products at an acceptable price or at all our operating results would be harmed 

in the semiconductor industry product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles therefore the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover and we are not able to compensate for those expenses our operating results would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory our operating results would be harmed 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

to the extent that our existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing conditions existing in the us capital markets if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital as well as the terms of any such financing we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 

a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• local economic and political conditions including social economic and political instability 

• disruptions of capital and trading markets 

• inability to collect accounts receivable 

• restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures including export duties quotas customs duties import or export controls and tariffs 

• changes in legal or regulatory requirements 

• natural disasters acts of terrorism widespread illness and war 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds 

• difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 

• cultural differences in the conduct of business 

• the laws and policies of the united states and other countries affecting trade foreign investment and loans and import or export licensing requirements 

• tax laws 

• the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction and 

• limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

• changes in enduser demand for the products principally digital cellular handsets manufactured and sold by our customers 

• the effects of competitive pricing pressures including decreases in average selling prices of our products 

• production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields 

• availability and cost of products from our suppliers 

• the gain or loss of significant customers 

• our ability to develop introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis 

• new product and technology introductions by competitors 

• changes in the mix of products produced and sold 

• market acceptance of our products and our customers and 

• intellectual property disputes 

• our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing andor selling noncore intellectual property 

the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

 

we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we or one of our customers were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

in addition if another supplier to one of our customers or a customer of ours itself were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture import use sale or offer for sale of its infringing products or processes either of which could result indirectly in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products if such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business could be adversely affected 

we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

• the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties will be successful 

• any existing or future patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or 

• any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection 

despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion even if we receive a patent the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology furthermore even if we receive patent protection in the united states we may not seek or may not be granted patent protection in foreign countries in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

there is a growing industry trend to include or adapt “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its developers authors or third parties often such software includes license provisions requiring public 

disclosure of any derivative works containing open source code there is little legal precedent in the area of open source software or its effects on copyright law or the protection of proprietary works we take steps to avoid the use of open source works in our proprietary software and are taking steps to limit our suppliers from doing so however in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate in court that we have not complied with a software license we may be required to cease production or distribution of that work or to publicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software which may negatively affect our operations or stock price 

we attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational technological and legal safeguards despite our efforts parties including former or current employees may attempt to copy disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization furthermore attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations while we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information 

to be successful we may need to effect investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire 

although we have invested in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

• issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders 

• large onetime writeoffs 

• the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities 

• the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company 

• amortization expenses related to intangible assets and 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

• the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis one class each year 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders 

• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent 

• elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 

• a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders 

• a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 23 percent of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our bylaws 

• a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors the classified board or the right to act by written consent 

• a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors and in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5 or more of our shares a majority of the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5 or more of our shares 

• a fair price provision and 

• a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90 of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision 

in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 

increasingly stringent environmental laws rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to costeffectively produce our products 

the semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmental regulations a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances a number of which have been used in our products or processes for example the european union restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the rohs directive while we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible or may only be available from a single source or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts additionally if we were found to be noncompliant with any such rule or regulation we could be subject to fines penalties andor restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states and in foreign countries we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for 

our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities furthermore our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future accordingly the price of our notes may fluctuate 

the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

• our performance and prospects 

• the performance and prospects of our major customers 

• the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock 

• investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate 

• changes in earnings estimates or buysell recommendations by analysts 

• general financial and other market conditions and 

• domestic and international economic conditions 

public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in addition fluctuations in our stock price volume of shares traded and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis our company has been and in the future may be the subject of commentary by financial news media such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline possibly substantially over a short period of time

basis of presentation 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2007 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 28 2007 and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 respectively 

results of operations 

years ended september 28 2007 september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 

the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 

general 

during fiscal 2007 certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations more specifically 

 

net revenues 

 

we market and sell our mobile platforms and linear products to top tier original equipment manufacturers “oems” of communication electronic products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors we periodically enter into strategic arrangements leveraging our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our patents or other intellectual property we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 

overall revenues in fiscal 2007 declined by 320 million or 41 from fiscal 2006 due to the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal year 2006 revenues from our core products remained relatively unchanged over that same period we experienced a more favorable product mix in fiscal 2007 which was offset by a decline in average selling prices of 81 and units sold of 15 in our core products area 

revenues from our core products increased by 779 million or 119 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 overall net revenues decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of a decrease in baseband product area revenues of 771 million a 627 decrease units sold in our core product areas increased by 332 somewhat offset by an overall average selling price decline of approximately 10 in our linear product area and approximately 2 in our frontend solutions and multimode radio product area 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross profit 

 

gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation and equity based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 

gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 387 from 339 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 as higher gross profit margin core products became a greater percentage of our overall sales since we exited the lower margin baseband product area at the end of fiscal 2006 additionally inventory related charges recorded in fiscal 2006 related to the exit of our baseband product area did not recur in fiscal 2007 furthermore we improved absorption as our factory utilization increased and we experienced improved overall yields and greater equipment efficiency finally we benefited from higher contribution margins received from the licensing and sale of intellectual property in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 

gross profit for fiscal 2006 decreased by 451 million from approximately 3078 million in fiscal 2005 and gross profit margin decreased to 339 from 388 in fiscal 2005 gross profit on our core products actually increased in aggregate dollars in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the 233 million approximately 50 of the decrease in aggregate dollars in inventory related charges associated with the exit of the baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

additionally the decline in baseband product area revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 of 771 million resulted in an approximate decline in contribution margin of 386 million we also incurred approximately 22 million in sharebased compensation expense in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r no sharebased compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 2005 in cost of goods sold 

research and development 

 

research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 

the decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 is predominantly attributable to decreased labor and benefit costs as a result of the workforce reductions associated with the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal 2006 in addition efficiencies were achieved in the utilization of outside services fixed materials and supplies rent costs relocation costs business travel and hardwaresoftware costs the reductions in the labor intensive research and development costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area has enabled us to refocus enhance and target our research and development spending on our higher growth core product areas in fiscal year 2007 which we believe will drive future revenue in these product areas 

research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 by 119 million or 78 this increase is primarily attributable to increased labor and benefit costs incurred to support our next generation multimode radios and precision analog semiconductors the increase in research and development costs primarily supports new product introductions as well as new product development focused on diversifying our product portfolio within our linear products area outside of the cellular handset market we also incurred 63 million in research and development related sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r no research and development related sharebased compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 2005 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service etc bad debt expense sales representative commissions advertising and other marketing costs 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to our recording of 351 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as we exited our baseband product area as well as lower sales commissions expense and lower legal and other professional fees in fiscal 2007 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 is principally due to our recording of 351 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 specifically we recorded charges related to two customers vitelcom mobile and an asian component distributor on accounts receivable associated with our baseband products we also incurred 57 million in selling general and administrative related sharebased compensation expense in 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r the 

increased bad debt and sfas 123r expenses were partially offset by reductions in legal expenses incurred to protect our intellectual property portfolio 

amortization of intangible assets and warrants 

 

in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark acquired by the company these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 

amortization expense on intangible assets declined in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recognition of amortization expense on a warrant in fiscal 2005 the warrant expired without being exercised on january 20 2005 

for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets see note 6 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring and special charges 

 

no special charges were recorded in fiscal 2005 

restructuring and special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities as follows 

on september 29 2006 the company exited its baseband product area in order to focus on its core business encompassing linear products power amplifiers frontend modules and radio solutions the company recorded various charges associated with this action 

during the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 we recorded 131 million related to severance and benefits 74 million related to the writedown of technology licenses and design software 42 million related to the impairment of certain longlived assets and 23 million related to other charges 

during the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 we recorded additional restructuring charges of 49 million related to the exit of the baseband product area these charges consist of 45 million relating to the exit of certain operating leases 05 million relating to additional severance 14 million related to the writeoff of technology licenses and design software offset by a 15 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve originally recorded to account for an engineering vendor charge associated with the exit of the baseband product area in addition the company recorded an additional 08 million charge for a single lease obligation that expires in 2008 relating to our 2002 restructuring 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances see note 14 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is comprised principally of payments in connection with the 500 million credit facility between skyworks usa inc our wholly owned subsidiary and wachovia bank na “facility agreement” the company’s 475 convertible subordinated notes the “junior notes” and the company’s 150 and 125 convertible subordinated notes the “2007 convertible notes” 

the decrease in interest expense both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the retirement of 1300 million of our higher interest rate junior notes replaced with the proceeds of the issuance of the substantially lower interest rate 2007 convertible notes in march 2007 

interest expense increased for fiscal 2006 as compared to the previous year primarily due to a higher interest rate paid on the facility agreement resulting from an increase in libor during such period as well as an increase in the amortization of capitalized deferred financing costs of 06 million due to the retirement of 507 million of our junior notes this was partially offset by a decrease in required interest payments due to the retirement of 507 million of our junior notes in fiscal 2006 

for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

other income net 

 

other income net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances other nonoperating income and expense items and foreign exchange gainslosses 

the increase in other income net between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 as well as between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income on invested cash balances as a result of increased interest rates and higher invested cash balances 

provision for income taxes 

 

income tax benefit for fiscal 2007 was 09 million as compared to 154 million expense for fiscal 2006 income tax benefit expense for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 consists of approximately 22 million and 01 million respectively of united states income tax benefit the fiscal 2007 tax benefit of 22 million is due to a 17 million 

reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating carryforwards and the reversal of 05 million of tax reserve no longer required the income tax provision for fiscal 2006 was comprised of a favorable adjustment of 01 million between fiscal 2005’s tax provision and tax return liability and foreign tax expense of 155 million the income tax provision for fiscal 2005 of 154 million was comprised of us income tax benefit of 07 million foreign income tax expense of 50 million and a charge in lieu of tax expense of 111 million the charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of acquisition the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill 

the provision for foreign income taxes for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 was 13 million 155 million and 50 million respectively foreign tax expense for fiscal 2006 included a one time charge of 146 million to write off a deferred tax asset as a result of reorganizing our mexico business the fiscal 2005 foreign tax expense included a charge of 22 million to remeasure mexico’s deferred tax assets because of a reduction to the statutory income tax rate in mexico 

in accordance with sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized accordingly as of september 28 2007 we have established a valuation allowance of 1513 million related to our united states deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered 

realization of the company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating united states source income in the future based on the company’s evaluation of the realizability of its united states net operating loss carryforwards through the generation of future taxable income 142 million of the company’s valuation allowance was reversed at september 28 2007 the amount reversed consisted of 17 million recognized as income tax benefit and 125 million recognized as a reduction to goodwill the remaining valuation allowance as of september 28 2007 is 1513 million when recognized the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows approximately 1288 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit 186 million will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill and 39 million will be recognized as an increase to shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options 

the company will continue to evaluate its valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the outcome of that assessment additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense such adjustments could cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods we will need to generate 2167 million of future united states federal taxable income to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards as of september 28 2007 

no provision has been made for united states state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 110 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

on september 14 2007 the congress of mexico approved a new “flat tax” regime which will become effective january 1 2008 the new flat tax replaces the corporate asset tax and is similar to a minimum tax the company is currently evaluating the impact of this tax upon its future operating results 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

fiscal 2007 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2007 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

our cash and cash equivalent balances increased by 1048 million to 2416 million at september 28 2007 from 1367 million at september 29 2006 cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments increased by 826 million to 2538 million at september 28 2007 from 1712 million at september 29 2006 the number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 increased to 80 from 73 as compared to fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2007 we generated 848 million in cash from operating activities contributing to these positive operating cash flows was net income of 577 million we also incurred multiple noncash charges eg depreciation amortization contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans sharebased compensation expense and noncash restructuring expense totaling 664 million in fiscal 2007 we also experienced a decrease in accounts payable balances of 167 million a decrease in other accrued liability balances of 108 million and an increase in receivable balances of 107 million furthermore we experienced an increase in deferred tax assets of 17 million primarily resulting from the partial release of our tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 finally provision for losses on accounts receivable increased by 22 million principally due to further reserves recorded for baseband product area customers 

during fiscal 2007 we utilized 201 million in cash from investing activities cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 consisted of net proceeds of 225 million from the sale of auction rate securities capital expenditures of 426 million offset these net proceeds and were primarily related to the purchase of equipment utilized in our fabrication facilities to support and enhance our assembly and test capacity we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 

during fiscal 2007 we generated 402 million in cash from financing activities this principally resulted from the issuance of our 2007 convertible notes offering which generated gross proceeds of 2000 million and stock option exercises of 83 million offset by repayment of 1300 million on our junior notes a common stock buyback of 43 million shares at a cost of approximately 317 million and financing costs associated with our 2007 convertible notes offering of 62 million as of september 28 2007 our facility agreement of 500 million is fully drawn we paid approximately 124 million in interest to service the 2007 convertible notes the junior notes and the facility agreement in fiscal 2007 for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with our exit of the baseband product area we anticipate making remaining cash payments of approximately 41 million in future periods certain payments on longterm lease obligations resulting from facility closures and severance payments will be remitted in fiscal 2008 and beyond we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and shortterm investments will be sufficient to fund these costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area

on july 15 2003 we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to skyworks usa inc “skyworks usa” a whollyowned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes concurrently skyworks usa entered into an agreement with wachovia bank na providing for a 500 million credit facility “facility agreement’’ secured by the purchased accounts receivable as a part of the consolidation any interest incurred by skyworks usa related to 

monies it borrows under the facility agreement is recorded as interest expense in the company’s results of operations we perform collections and administrative functions on behalf of skyworks usa interest related to the facility agreement is at libor plus 04 as of september 28 2007 skyworks usa had borrowed 500 million under this agreement 

we retired the remaining 493 million in aggregate principal amount of the junior notes plus 12 million in accrued and unpaid interest on the due date of november 15 2007 

in october 2007 the company paid 324 million in cash to acquire from two separate companies raw materials die bank finished goods proprietary gaas pafem designs and related intellectual property as well as sixteen fundamental hbt and rf mems patents

our cash and cash equivalent balances increased by 202 million to 1367 million at september 29 2006 from 1165 million at september 30 2005 cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments decreased by 647 million to 1712 million at september 29 2006 from 2359 million at september 30 2005 the number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 decreased to 73 from 82 as compared to fiscal 2005 partially due to the recording of allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the exit of our baseband product area 

during fiscal 2006 we generated 272 million in cash from operating activities offsetting these positive operating cash flows were net losses of 882 million which included total charges incurred to exit our baseband product area we also incurred multiple noncash charges eg depreciation amortization contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans sharebased compensation expense noncash restructuring expense asset impairment charges and provision for deferred income taxes totaling 757 million in fiscal 2006 we also experienced an increase in other accrued liabilities and expenses of 160 million principally related to restructuring accruals in the fourth fiscal quarter and a decrease in deferred tax assets of 165 million and an increase of 312 million in the provision for losses on accounts receivable principally related to the reserves recorded on two baseband customers these increases were offset by uses of cash caused by increases of 182 million in accounts receivable and 35 million in inventory however on a net basis accounts receivable actually declined by 130 million when accounting for the impact of the aforementioned 312 million increase in the provision for losses on accounts receivable 

during fiscal 2006 we generated 424 million in cash from investing activities cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 consisted of net proceeds of 852 million from the sale of auction rate securities and proceeds received from the sale of a building and land of 66 million capital expenditures of 494 million offset these amounts and were primarily related to the purchase of equipment utilized to support an anticipated expanded level of highly integrated product demand requiring more technologically enhanced manufacturing capacity the proceeds from the net sales of our auction rate securities were utilized in part to retire 507 million of our junior notes we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 

during fiscal 2006 we utilized 494 million in cash from financing activities this principally resulted from the retirement of 507 million in our junior notes and the pledge of 03 million in cash on a new insurance policy offset by stock option exercises of 17 million as of september 29 2006 our facility agreement of 500 million is fully drawn our junior notes of approximately 1793 million become due in november 2007 we paid approximately 137 million in interest to service this debt during fiscal 2006 for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash flows 

following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt purchase agreements operating leases other commitments and longterm liabilities at september 28 2007 see notes 7 and 11 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in thousands 

 

 

 critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue from license fees and intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable and all other criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” have been met we ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market the company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the recoverability of inventories is assessed through an ongoing review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of twelve months the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 

once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required some or all of the inventories that have been writtendown may be retained and made available for sale in the event that actual demand is higher than originally projected a portion of these inventories 

may be able to be sold in the future inventories that have been writtendown and are identified as obsolete are generally scrapped 

sharebased compensation 

on october 1 2005 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options employee stock purchases related to the company’s 2002 employee stock purchase plan restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values sfas 123r supersedes the company’s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006 in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “share based payment” “sab 107” providing interpretative guidance relating to sfas 123r the company has applied the provisions of sab 107 in its adoption of sfas 123r 

the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of october 1 2005 the first day of the company’s fiscal year 2006 

the company’s practice in general is to issue shares of common stock upon exercise or settlement of options and to issue shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan “espp” from previously unissued shares 

sharebased compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of sharebased payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period sharebased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 included compensation expense for sharebased payment awards granted on or before but not yet vested as of september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas 123 and compensation expense for the sharebased payment awards granted subsequent to september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r as sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

upon adoption of sfas 123r the company elected to retain its method of valuation for sharebased awards using the blackscholes optionpricing model “blackscholes model” which was also previously used for the company’s pro forma information required under sfas 123 the company’s determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

sfas 123r requires the company to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in conjunction with calculating sharebased compensation expense these assumptions include the expected life of a stock option or other equity based award expected volatility prevesting forfeiture risk free rate and expected dividend yield all of these assumptions affect to one degree or another the valuation of the company’s equity based awards or the recognition of the resulting sharebased compensation expense the most significant assumptions in the company’s calculations are described below 

expected life of an option or other equity based award 

since employee options are nontransferable sfas 123r allows the use of an expected life to more accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual term 

the vesting of the majority of the company’s stock options are graded over four years 25 at each anniversary and the contractual term is either 7 years or 10 years the company analyzed its historical exercise experience and 

exercise behavior by job group the company analyzed the following three exercise metrics exercise at full vesting exercise at midpoint in the contractual life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term the company chose the midpoint alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of its employee population the valuation and resulting sharebased compensation expense recorded is sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could result in a material difference in the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

expected volatility 

expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period sfas 123r does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life implied volatilities the length of time a stock has been publicly traded regular intervals for price observations corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion the company analyzed its volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of 50 to historical volatility and 50 to implied volatility as measured by examining the underlying volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options would provide the best estimate of expected future volatility of the stock price the selection of another methodology to calculate volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

prevesting forfeiture 

sfas 123r specifies that initial accruals of sharebased compensation expense should be based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered the company examined its options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture percentage the company determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience the application of a different methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

valuation of longlived assets 

carrying values for longlived assets and definite lived intangible assets which excludes goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to the company’s business model or changes in its operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group the company recognizes an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company’s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value the company calculates fair value using the average market price of its common stock over a sevenday period surrounding the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the annual impairment test the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter if the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the company performs step two step two of 

the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination if the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

income taxes 

the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the carrying value of the company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company’s consolidated statement of operations management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly likewise in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period such determination was made 

it was previously the company’s intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of all its foreign subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes — special areas” during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company reversed its policy of permanently reinvesting the earnings of its mexican business this policy reversal increased the 2005 tax provision by 90 million for the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 us income tax was provided on current earnings attributable to our operations in mexico no provision has been made for us federal state or additional foreign income taxes that would be due upon the actual or deemed distribution of undistributed earnings of the other foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested 

on november 10 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for tax effects of sharebased payment awards” the “fasb staff position” the company adopted the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of sharebased compensation pursuant to sfas 123r during the year ended september 29 2006 the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital pool “apic pool” related to the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas 123r under the simplified method the company’s beginning apic pool is zero and the ending apic pool balance at september 28 2007 remains zero 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

fin 48 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions as defined fin 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and is therefore effective for the company in fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting fin 48 will have on the company’s financial position and results of operations however at this time the company does not expect the impact to materially affect its results from operations or financial position 

sfas 157 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company has not yet determined the impact that sfas 157 will have on its results from operations or financial position 

sab 108 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 the company adopted sab 108 in fiscal year 2007 and its adoption did not materially impact its results from operations or financial position 

sfas 159 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” including an amendment of sfas no 115 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value sfas 159 is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2009 the company is currently evaluating sfas 159 and the impact that it may have on results of operations or financial position 

other matters 

inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the threeyear period ended september 28 2007 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm debt and longterm debt our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital consequently we invest with only highcreditquality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of september 28 2007 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 

our short term investments consist of auction rate securities which have longterm underlying maturities ranging from 20 to 40 years the market has historically been highly liquid and the interest rates reset every 28 or 31 days the company’s intent is not to hold these securities to maturity but rather to use the interest rate reset feature to sell these securities to provide liquidity as needed the company’s practice is to invest in these securities for higher yields compared to cash equivalents such shortterm investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short time period associated with the interest reset feature gains and losses are included in investment income in the period they are realized due to their inherent structure auction rate securities carry higher market risk than commercial paper investments 

our shortterm debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na of 500 million and junior notes with current maturities of 493 million 475 unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na is at libor plus 04 and was approximately 54 at september 28 2007 consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on this shortterm debt the junior notes are convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interestrate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interestrate environment and the price of the underlying common stock for the year ended september 28 2007 our junior notes on an ifconverted basis were not dilutive and as a result had no impact on our net income loss per share assuming dilution we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our junior notes 

our longterm debt consists of 2000 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes “2007 convertible notes” these 2007 convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the company’s common stock exceed 952 it has been the company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future including settlement of the 2007 convertible notes issued in march 2007 these shares have not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended september 28 2007 as their effect would have been antidilutive the maximum potential dilution from the settlement of the 2007 convertible notes would be approximately 210 million shares we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our junior notes 

based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september 28 2007 a nearterm change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in various foreign countries we do not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our foreign subsidiaries as we do not believe we have any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk because most of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars

 item 1 business 

introduction 

skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is an innovator of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity the company’s power amplifiers frontend modules and direct conversion radios are at the heart of many of today’s leadingedge multimedia handsets leveraging core technologies skyworks also offers a diverse portfolio of linear products that support automotive broadband cellular infrastructure industrial and medical applications 

skyworks was formed through the merger “merger” of the wireless business of conexant systems inc “conexant” and alpha industries inc “alpha” on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 and amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha conexant and washington sub inc “washington” a whollyowned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business pursuant to the merger washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving corporation immediately following the merger alpha purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations the “mexicali operations” for purposes of this annual report on form 10k the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as “washingtonmexicali” shortly thereafter alpha which was incorporated in delaware in 1962 changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

headquartered in woburn mass skyworks is worldwide with engineering manufacturing sales and service facilities throughout asia europe and north america our internet address is wwwskyworksinccom we make available on our website free of charge our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k section 16 filings on forms 3 4 and 5 and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically submit such material with the securities and exchange commission “sec” the information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k 

industry background 

skyworks believes the wireless industry is in the midst of a significant transition with two major trends impacting the market landscape for wireless products and the way original equipment manufacturers “oems” engage semiconductor suppliers first there is a market share consolidation underway by virtually all analyst estimates 80 percent of the handset market is controlled by five oems second and perhaps even more dramatic is the number of handsets requiring both voice and high speed data functionality as consumers demand smaller handsets that include multimedia applications such as cameras mp3 players video streaming gaming web browsing and wifi based 80211 wireless data applications this demand increases the relative complexity of a handset since maintaining data integrity while at the same time handling a voice session is a significant challenge there is a greater need for compatibility among the radio frequency “rf” the analogmixed signal and system software as a result oems today are engaging suppliers as partners and much earlier in the development process by contrast in the past handset manufacturers could mix and match power amplifiers and transceivers much more readily using various suppliers — and they did so rather routinely skyworks believes that going forward the link between the frontend module radio and software is increasingly critical and can no longer be easily decoupled 

these market shifts are having a profound impact on the industry today particularly on semiconductor suppliers as handsets become more complex chipmakers will continue to look for new design and process techniques to remain in a leadership position with their customers 

the company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends with broad technology breadth and depth engagements with all top tier handset oems and manufacturing scale skyworks can be a leader within its peer group 

meanwhile outside of the handset market wireless technologies are rapidly proliferating as they are the critical link between the analog and digital worlds core analog technology allows for the detection measurement amplification and conversion of temperature pressure and audio information into the digital realm according to the semiconductor industry association the total available market for the analog semiconductor segment is expected to approach 50 billion in 2009 today this adjacent analog semiconductor market which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and higher gross margins is highly fragmented and diversified among various endmarkets customer bases and applications 

in 2004 skyworks launched its linear products business to aggressively leverage the company’s core competencies and modeling capabilities along with its strong catalog sales channels and specialized rep and distributor networks into nonhandset applications skyworks portfolio takes the intersection point between key strengths and the needs of the markets the company has targeted infrastructure medical automotive and broadband among others to create a business characterized by longer product lifecycles sustained revenue profiles diverse applications and contribution margins that are typically 10 to 15 points higher than the handset business 

skyworks’ strategy 

skyworks’ vision is to become the leading supplier of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity key elements in our strategy include 

 expanding power amplifier and frontend solutions market share 

our products offer customers solutions that significantly speed timetomarket while dramatically reducing bill of material costs power consumption and footprints we plan to increase our current 40 percent worldwide market share position through higher levels of integration and continued innovation leveraging our leading edge process and packaging technology 

capturing increasing dollar content in third and fourth generation applications 

as the industry migrates to multimode edge wedge wcdma and wimax architectures rf complexity in the transmit and receive chain substantially increases given simultaneous voice and high speed data communications requirements coupled with the need for backward compatibility to existing networks as a result skyworks believes that the addressable semiconductor market for our solutions essentially doubles 

gaining rf market share in helios™ digrf and wdcma 

we continue to expand our radio presence with the helios™ platform which bundles our single chip direct conversion transceiver and frontend module skyworks is now supporting the majority of tier one handset oems with complete radios and we look forward to even greater traction as we launch our differentiated digrf and wcdma solutions in the coming year 

diversifying into adjacent linear markets 

by leveraging core analog mixed signal and rf technology skyworks is also able to deliver solutions to broader and diverse markets that are characterized by longer product lifecycles sustained revenue profiles and higher contribution margins than our handset business while the addressable market for linear products is highly fragmented it is roughly four times the size of the cellular handset rf industry 

delivering operational excellence 

skyworks’ strategy is to vertically integrate where we can differentiate or otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leadingedge capabilities these partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership and competitive advantage in the marketplace we are focused on achieving the industry’s shortest cycle times highest yields and ultimately the lowest product cost structure 

business framework 

during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 skyworks began the restructuring of its business by discontinuing its baseband operations in order to sharpen focus on its high growth core business skyworks’ baseband product area developed complete reference designs incorporating the digital signal processor and software functionality in support of tierthree handset suppliers this initiative was complex research and development intensive and generated substantial operating losses as tierone oems increasingly dominate the landscape the addressable market for the company’s baseband solutions had significantly contracted as a result of this decision skyworks restructured its business to focus on its core analog and rf product markets 

to address the wireless industry opportunities discussed above and to execute our strategy we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios that when coupled with key customer relationships with all major handset manufacturers positions us well to meet industry needs below are just a few examples from each of our product portfolios

the skyworks advantage 

by turning complexity into simplicity we provide our customers with the following competitive advantages 

 

marketing and distribution 

our products are primarily sold through a direct skyworks sales force this team is globally deployed across all major market regions in some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent manufacturers’ representatives assuring broader coverage of territories and customers we also utilize distribution partners some of which are franchised globally with others focused in specific regional markets eg europe north america china and taiwan 

we maintain an internal marketing organization that is responsible for developing sales and advertising literature print media such as product announcements and catalogs as well as a variety of webbased content skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a customer design we strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the inception of a new program this partnership allows our team to facilitate customerdriven solutions which leverage the unique strength of our portfolio while providing high value and greatly reducing timetomarket 

we believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an extraordinary commitment to close ongoing relationships with our customers as such we strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design engineering manufacturing purchasing and project management we also employ a collaborative approach in developing these partnerships by combining the support of our design teams applications engineers manufacturing personnel sales and marketing staff and senior management 

we believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to provide worldclass sales and service support by listening and responding to feedback we are able to mobilize actions to raise the level of customer satisfaction improve our ability to anticipate future product needs and enhance our understanding of key market dynamics we are confident that diligence in following this path will position skyworks to participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future 

revenues from and dependence on customers customer concentration 

for information regarding customer concentration and revenues from external customers for our reportable segment for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

we own or are licensed under numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products our manufacturing operations and processes and other activities in addition we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services we believe that intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies devices algorithms and processes we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies devices algorithms or processes in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and effective copyright patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions in addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain crosslicenses of intellectual property from others to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us due to rapid technological changes in the industry we believe that establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel 

competitive conditions 

we compete on the basis of timetomarket new product innovation overall product quality and performance price compliance with industry standards strategic relationships with customers and protection of our intellectual property certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers resellers suppliers or other third parties these relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 

research and development 

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies our research and development expenditures for fiscal years ended september 29 2006 september 30 2005 and october 1 2004 were 1641 million 1522 million and 1526 million respectively 

raw materials 

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources we do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders however we have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities we request these raw materials and take title to them as they are needed in our manufacturing process we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels we also deliver product to certain external customer “hubs” consignment where our significant customers will pull inventory from their existing consignment inventories when required these consignment pulls trigger revenue recognition and we periodically replenish these inventory levels 

environmental regulations 

federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims has been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

most of our european customers have mandated that our products comply with local and regional lead free and other “green” initiatives we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

cyclicality seasonality 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change product obsolescence price erosion evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand these and other factors together with changes in general economic conditions may cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business we have experienced periods of industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these factors may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

sales of our products are also subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets this generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the end of the calendar year 

geographic information 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

employees 

as of september 29 2006 we employed approximately 4000 persons approximately 700 employees in mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements in september 2006 the company exited its baseband product area and shortly thereafter reduced its global workforce by approximately 10 these reductions are not reflected in the aforementioned employee census we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract motivate develop and retain highly skilled and dedicated employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

certain business risks 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect our future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards from time to time changes in general economic conditions together with other factors cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these characteristics and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations furthermore downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity and materials constraints which may affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

uncertainties involving shifting marketplace dynamics  

our operating results for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 were adversely affected by shifting marketplace dynamics which favored tier i and tier ii handset manufacturers and suppliers consolidation of the global handset marketplace from smaller tier iii handset customers primarily located in developing countries to tier i and tier ii customers accelerated in fiscal 2006 this trend led to a slowdown in customer orders increasing channel inventories and customer defaults on accounts receivable we responded to this rapidly changing dynamic by exiting our baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 while this marketplace shift only affected our baseband product area there can be no assurances that future changes in marketplace conditions in our other product areas will not materially and adversely affect our operating results we may not be able to respond to shifting customer demand in other product areas on a timely basis if at all and accordingly this could result in a material and adverse impact to our operating results 

we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 

our operating results for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were adversely affected by a global economic slowdown decreased consumer confidence reduced capital spending and adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries these factors led to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions although we emerged from this period of economic 

weakness in fiscal 2004 should economic conditions deteriorate for any reason it could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix and other impacts that would materially and adversely affect our operating results due to this economic uncertainty although we were profitable in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such profitability or that we will not experience future operating losses 

additionally the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts natural disasters acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest contributes to the economic uncertainty these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen or both our business financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 

as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share furthermore some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufacture products similar to ours and may compete with us we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 

our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to pay warranty claims replace products or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer’s products containing our parts 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may include electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism health advisories or risks or other natural or manmade disasters disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

 

although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

although we own and operate a test and assembly facility we still depend on subcontractors to package assemble and test certain of our products we do not have longterm agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties suffers any damage to its facilities experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components any problems that we may encounter with the delivery quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations we are continuing to develop relationships with additional thirdparty subcontractors to assemble and test our products however even if we use these new subcontractors we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs recent increased demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components has resulted in tighter supplies we cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our delivery schedules that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications if a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities if we were to lose this sole source of supply for any reason a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained to the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

changes in the accounting treatment of sharebased compensation have adversely affected our results of operations 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” to require companies to expense employee stock options for financial reporting purposes such equitybased award expensing has required us to value our employee stock option grants and other equitybased awards pursuant to an option valuation formula and amortize that value against our earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options historically we accounted for stockbased awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and had adopted the disclosureonly alternative of sfas no 123 “accounting for sharebased compensation” we implemented sfas 123r in the reporting period starting october 1 2005 this change in accounting treatment has materially affected our reported results of operations as the sharebased compensation expense has been and will continue to be charged directly against our reported earnings but will have no impact on cash flows from operations we anticipate that our sharebased compensation expense will approximate 242 million in total from fiscal 2007 through 2010 this expense projection is calculated as of september 29 2006 and does not take into account any future equity awards that we might issue nor does it account for future actual stockbased award forfeitures we will be required to adjust future sharebased compensation expense for actual future stock option forfeitures 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and in particular the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration increased miniaturization and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors including 

 

our ability to manufacture current products and to develop new products depends among other factors on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems “it systems” 

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface if we fail to 

rapidly and costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 

in addition prices of many of our products decline sometimes significantly over time we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 

the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics 

 

these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the abovenoted factors 

the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

if oems and original design manufacturers “odms” of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products are not sold directly to the enduser but are components or subsystems of other products as a result we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we 

will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom have rights to return unsold products we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for nonreturnable products could be impaired 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the company recorded bad debt expense of 351 million specifically the company recorded charges related to two customers vitelcom mobile and an asian component distributor 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on september 29 2006 we had total indebtedness of approximately 2293 million which represented approximately 252 of our total capitalization 

as long as our 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 remain outstanding we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately 85 million per year if we issue other debt securities in the future our debt service obligations will increase 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations to replace existing or maturing debt instruments purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months if necessary among other alternatives we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other longterm debt lines of credit and other financing 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

 

 

despite our current debt levels we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products our business would be materially and adversely affected sales to our three largest customers including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors represented approximately 500 of our net revenue for fiscal 2006 we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in fiscal 2007 and for the foreseeable future 

average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short  

in the semiconductor industry product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles therefore the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover and we are not able to compensate for those expenses our operating results would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory our operating results would be harmed 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

we might obtain additional sources of financing in the future based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing will likely allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing conditions existing in the us capital markets if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital as well as the terms of any such financing we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 

a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

 

additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

 

the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock  

global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

global economic weakness can have wideranging effects on markets that we serve particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators although the wireless communications industry has recovered somewhat from an industrywide recession such recovery may not continue in addition we cannot predict what effects negative events such as war or other international conflicts may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties further a continued economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term if it does not our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it 

any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

 

we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 

we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

 

despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion even if we receive a patent the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology furthermore even if we receive patent protection in the united states we may not seek or may not be granted patent protection in foreign countries in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

there is a growing industry trend to include or adapt “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its developers authors or third parties often such software includes license provisions requiring public disclosure of any derivative works containing open source code there is little legal precedent in the area of open source software or its effects on copyright law or the protection of proprietary works we take steps to avoid the use of open source works in our proprietary software and are taking steps to limit our suppliers from doing so however in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate in court that we have not complied with a software license we may be required to cease production or distribution of that work or to publicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software which may negatively affect our operations or stock price 

we attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational technological and legal safeguards despite our efforts parties including former or current employees may attempt to copy disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization furthermore attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations while we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information 

our success depends in part on our ability to effect suitable investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire 

although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we intend to review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

 

 

moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings for instance we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the amount of 3971 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

 

 

in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 

increasingly stringent environmental laws rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to costeffectively produce our products 

the semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmental regulations a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances a number of which have been used in our products or processes for example the european union restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the rohs directive while we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible or may only be available from a single source or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts additionally if we were found to be noncompliant with any such rule or regulation we could be subject to fines penalties andor restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states and in foreign countries we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities furthermore our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future accordingly you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 

the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

 

 

public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in addition fluctuations in our stock price volume of shares traded and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis our company has been and in the future may be the subject of commentary by financial news media such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline possibly substantially over a short period of time accordingly you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k  in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ substantially and adversely from those referred to herein due to a number of factors including but not limited to those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is an innovator of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity the company’s power amplifiers frontend modules and direct conversion radios are at the heart of many of today’s leadingedge multimedia handsets leveraging core technologies skyworks also offers a diverse portfolio of linear products that support automotive broadband cellular infrastructure industrial and medical applications 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand in the past average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future our operating results have been and our operating results may continue to be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors such as changes in demand for enduser equipment the timing of the receipt reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders the gain or loss of significant customers market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products our ability to develop introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis availability and cost of products from suppliers new product and technology introductions by competitors changes in the mix of products produced and sold intellectual property disputes the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to pay warranty claims replace products or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer’s products containing our parts 

business framework 

at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter skyworks decided to immediately cease its baseband operations in order to sharpen focus on its high growth core business skyworks’ baseband product area developed complete reference designs incorporating the digital signal processor and software functionality in support of tierthree handset suppliers this initiative was complex research and development intensive and generated substantial operating losses as tierone oems increasingly dominate the landscape the addressable market for the company’s baseband solutions had significantly contracted as a result of this decision skyworks restructured its business to focus on its core analog and rf product markets 

to address the wireless industry opportunities discussed above and to execute our strategy we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios that when coupled with key customer relationships with all major handset manufacturers positions us well to meet industry needs below are just a few examples from each of our product portfolios 

basis of presentation 

skyworks was formed through the merger “merger” of the wireless business of conexant systems inc “conexant” and alpha industries inc “alpha” on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 and amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha industries inc conexant systems inc and washington sub inc “washington” a whollyowned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business pursuant to the merger washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving corporation immediately following the merger alpha purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations the “mexicali operations” for purposes of this annual report on form 10k the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as “washingtonmexicali” shortly thereafter alpha which was incorporated in delaware in 1962 changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2006 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 29 2006 and fiscal years 2005 and 2004 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 30 2005 and october 1 2004 respectively 

results of operations 

years ended september 29 2006 september 30 2005 and october 1 2004 

the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 

 

general 

during fiscal 2006 certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations more specifically 

 

sharedbased payments 

we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our stock option plans we also grant restricted stock to certain key employees which may have service market or performance based conditions attached and we also granted performance shares to certain of our employees during the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at 85 of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of the offering period under our employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sfas 123r” “sharebased payment” effective october 

1 2005 we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas 123r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing sharebased compensation the valuation provisions of sfas 123r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled under the modified prospective application prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes sharebased compensation expense recognized under sfas 123r for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 was 142 million at september 29 2006 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to nonvested stock options granted prior to that date was 201 million the weighted average period over which the unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to nonvested stock options will be recognized is 18 years stock options before forfeitures and cancellations granted during the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 represented 24 of the company’s outstanding shares as of september 29 2006 

at september 29 2006 total unrecognized estimated compensation for restricted stock nonvested awards was 41 million 

upon adoption of sfas 123r the company elected to retain its method of valuation for sharebased awards granted beginning in fiscal 2006 using the blackscholes optionpricing model “blackscholes model” which was also previously used for the company’s pro forma information required under statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas 123” “accounting for stockbased compensation” the company’s determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period therefore we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using optionpricing models to estimate sharebased compensation under sfas 123r optionpricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with sfas 123r and the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” “interaction between fasb statement no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies” using an optionpricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerwilling seller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us for this reason and because we do not view sharebased compensation as related to our operational performance we exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operations 

the guidance in sfas 123r and sab 107 is relatively new and best practices are still evolving the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time there are significant differences among valuation models and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of sharebased payments it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models methods and assumptions 

theoretical valuation models and marketbased methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for sharebased compensation the timing readiness adoption general acceptance reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information modeling expertise financial analyses correlation analyses integrated software and databases consulting fees customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls marketbased methods are emerging that if employed 

by us may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 

we did not modify any of our outstanding share options prior to the adoption of sfas 123r with the exception of the acceleration of certain of our unvested “out of the money” stock options on september 2 2005 specifically we accelerated the vesting of options previously awarded to employees and officers that had an exercise price per share over 900 and were granted prior to november 10 2004 as a result of this action options to purchase approximately 38 million shares of skyworks common stock became immediately exercisable the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was accounted for under apb opinion number 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and made to avoid recognizing compensation cost of approximately 210 million associated with certain “outofthemoney” options in the statement of operations in future financial statements upon the effectiveness of sfas 123r the decision to not accelerate the vesting of stock options with an exercise price under 901 as well as those granted after november 9 2004 balanced our desire to manage compensation expense with our need to continue to motivate and retain employees the options accelerated were “outofthe money” by a minimum of 149 per share based on the closing market price of skyworks’ common stock on september 2 2005 

during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 we elected to gradually transition more of our sharebased compensation awards to restricted stock with service market or performance based conditions from traditional stock options 

we granted 222000 performance units during the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 pursuant to which recipients will receive skyworks common stock if certain milestones are achieved of the 222000 performance units we issued 49000 shares in fiscal 2006 as a result of milestone achievement in addition certain other milestones were deemed to be highly probable of achievement thus we recorded total compensation expense of 03 million in fiscal 2006 

we used an arithmetic average of historical volatility and implied volatility to calculate our expected volatility at september 29 2006 historical volatility was determined by calculating the mean reversion of the dailyadjusted closing stock price over the past 425 years of our existence postmerger the implied volatility was calculated by analyzing the 52week minimum and maximum prices of publicly traded call options on our common stock we concluded that an arithmetic average of these two calculations provided for the most reasonable estimate of expected volatility under the guidance of sfas 123r utilizing this methodology results in a volatility of 5927 at september 29 2006 

the expected life of employee stock options represents a calculation based upon the historical exercise experience of our stock options over the 425 years from june 2002 postmerger to september 29 2006 we determined that we had two populations with unique exercise behavior these populations included stock options with a contractual life of 7 years and 10 years respectively this methodology results in an expected term calculation of 442 and 584 years respectively 

the riskfree interest rate is based on the yield curve of us treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant weightedaverage of 455 at september 29 2006 

the postvesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information weightedaverage of 859 at september 29 2006 

net revenues 

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products including power amplifiers frontend modules radio solutions and linear products among others to top tier oems of communication electronics products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors 

revenues from our core mobile platforms and linear product areas increased by 779 million or 119 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 overall net revenues decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of a decrease in baseband revenues of 771 million a 627 decrease additionally we recorded a charge against revenue of 50 million in fiscal 2006 relating to the exit of the baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 units sold in our core product areas increased by 332 somewhat offset by an overall average selling price decline of approximately 10 in our linear product area and approximately 2 in our mobile platforms product area 

net revenues increased slightly overall in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of increased demand in our mobile platform product area revenues in aggregate dollars from our highly integrated complex products more than doubled between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 this increase in revenues was partially offset by an overall decrease in average selling prices in nearly all of our product areas during these periods additionally baseband revenues in aggregate dollars declined 139 and revenues from test and assembly declined by 627 due to the termination of the test and assembly services arrangement with conexant our revenues from the test and assembly business were 378 million in fiscal 2004 and 141 million in fiscal 2005 we fulfilled our manufacturing support obligation to conexant on june 30 2005 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross profit 

 

gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 

gross profit for fiscal 2006 decreased by 451 million from approximately 3078 million in fiscal 2005 and gross profit margin decreased to 339 from 388 in fiscal 2005 gross profit on our core mobile platforms and linear product areas actually increased in aggregate dollars in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the 233 million approximately 50 of the decrease in aggregate dollars in inventory related charges associated with the exit of the baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 additionally the decline in baseband product area revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 of 771 million resulted in an approximate decline in contribution margin of 386 million we also incurred approximately 22 million in sharebased compensation expense in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r no sharebased compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 2005 in cost of goods sold 

gross profit for fiscal 2005 decreased by 54 million from approximately 3132 million in fiscal 2004 and gross profit margin decreased from 399 to 388 from fiscal 2004 the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to 1 continued additional costs associated with the ongoing launch of a number of our more highly integrated products 2 an unfavorable shift in product mix in the fourth fiscal quarter and 3 a one time payment to a customer of 32 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 a decline in the assembly and test services provided to conexant in conjunction with fixed overhead and manufacturing costs in the assembly and test area also contributed to the decreased gross profit margin between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 

research and development 

 

research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 

although research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 increased when compared to fiscal 2005 we anticipate that we will achieve a reduction in research and development costs in future periods due to our exit of the baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the aforementioned increase is primarily attributable to increased labor and benefit costs incurred to support our next generation multimode radios and precision analog semiconductors we anticipate continued acceleration in the development and commercialization of our helios edge enhanced data rates for global evolution radio cdma “code division multiple access” solutions and next generation frontend modules and power amplifiers with several of our top customers in fiscal 2007 the increase in research and development costs primarily supports new product introductions as well as new product development focused on diversifying our product portfolio within our linear products area outside of the cellular handset market we also incurred 63 million in research and development related sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r no research and development related sharebased compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 2005 

research and development expenses in fiscal 2005 declined slightly when compared to fiscal 2004 the decline is principally due to decreased incentive compensation costs we also reduced research and development expenditures in the baseband product area during this period as we focused our product development on core frontend modules rf subsystems infrastructure and nextgeneration solutions 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service etc bad debt expense sales representative commissions advertising and other marketing costs 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 is principally due to our recording of 351 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 specifically we recorded charges related to two customers vitelcom mobile and an asian component distributor on accounts receivable associated with our baseband products we also incurred 57 million in selling general and administrative related sharebased compensation expense in 2006 related to our adoption of sfas 123r the increased bad debt and sfas 123r expenses were partially offset by reductions in legal expenses incurred to protect our intellectual property portfolio 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of 48 million between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 additionally costs incurred to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” contributed to the increase the increased bad debt expense and sarbanesoxley fees were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation costs and legal costs due to the settlement of an intellectual property lawsuit 

amortization of intangible assets and warrants 

 

in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 

amortization expense on intangible assets declined in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the recognition of amortization expense on a warrant of 02 million in fiscal 2005 the warrant expired without being exercised on january 20 2005 

the decrease in amortization expense on intangible assets between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 is the result of 08 million in amortization expense recognized on certain warrants in 2004 while only 02 million was recognized in fiscal 2005 

for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets see note 6 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring and special charges 

 

no special charges were recorded in fiscal 2005 

restructuring and special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities as follows 

2006 restructuring charges asset impairments and special charges 

on september 29 2006 we exited our baseband product area in order to focus on our core business encompassing linear products radio solutions power amplifiers and frontend modules we recorded various charges associated with this action we recorded charges which included the following 

we recorded 131 million related to severance and benefits 74 million related to the writedown of technology licenses and design software 42 million related to the impairment of certain longlived assets and 23 million related to other charges these charges total 270 million and are recorded in restructuring and special charges 

we anticipate recording additional restructuring charges of approximately 70 million related to the exit of the baseband product area in the first fiscal quarter of 2007 these charges primarily relate to costs to exit certain operating leases and the write down of a technology license 

2004 restructuring charges asset impairments and special charges 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a 132 million charge primarily related to the impairment of obsolete baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the merger the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to the decision to discontinue certain products and the related impact on its current and projected outlook management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets intangible assets machinery and equipment was impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products salvage value since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

during fiscal 2004 we consolidated baseband product area software design centers in an effort to improve our overall timeto market for nextgeneration multimedia systems development these actions aligned our structure with our current business environment we implemented reductions in force at three remote facilities and recorded restructuring charges of approximately 42 million for costs related to severance benefits for affected employees and lease obligations all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid as of september 29 2006 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances see note 14 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is comprised principally of payments in connection with the 500 million credit facility between skyworks usa inc our whollyowned subsidiary and wachovia bank na “facility agreement” and the company’s 475 convertible subordinated notes the “junior notes” 

interest expense increased for fiscal 2006 as compared to the previous year primarily due to a higher interest rate paid on the facility agreement resulting from an increase in libor during such period as well as an increase in the amortization of capitalized deferred financing costs of 06 million due to the retirement of 507 million of our junior notes this was partially offset by a decrease in required interest payments due to the retirement of 507 million of our junior notes in fiscal 2006 

the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 is due to the conversion of our 45 million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during fiscal 2004 specifically we recorded 125 million in interest expense and deferred financing costs amortization on our 230 million junior notes payable and 21 million in interest expense on our 50 million line of credit facility 

for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

other income net 

 

other income net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances other nonoperating income and expense items and foreign exchange gainslosses 

the increase in other income net between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 as well as between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income on invested cash balances as a result of increased interest rates earned on our auction rate securities 

provision for income taxes 

 

based upon our history of operating losses management has determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with our foreign operations consequently no united states income tax benefit has been recognized for the company’s united states operating losses as of september 29 2006 we have established a valuation allowance against all of our net united states deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes that is more likely than not that they will be recovered 

during fiscal 2006 the carrying value of our gross deferred tax assets increased by 388 million this increase is primarily due to charges included in united states income related to the exit of our baseband product area that were not tax benefited 

the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 consists of approximately 01 million and 111 million respectively of united states income taxes the credit of 01 million represents a favorable adjustment between fiscal 2005’s tax provision and tax return liability the provision for income tax for fiscal 2005 represents a charge reducing the carrying value of goodwill 

in addition the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 consists of foreign income taxes of 154 million 49 million and 40 million respectively in fiscal 2006 the company completed a legal reorganization of its mexico operations to reduce its future operating costs in connection with this reorganization ownership of machinery and equipment used in mexico’s operations was transferred to a united states subsidiary in 2002 the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately 230 million related to the impairment of this equipment the carrying value of the deferred tax asset related to these assets was 163 million as of september 30 2005 consequently the fiscal 2006 foreign tax provision includes the write off of this deferred tax asset reduced by the establishment of a 17 million deferred tax charge in connection with this reorganization the deferred tax asset allowable for us tax purposes is included in the company’s united states deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance 

the fiscal year 2005 foreign tax provision included a charge of 22 million resulting from a reduction of the statutory income tax rate in mexico deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a charge of 23 million related to normal amortization of the tax benefit for tax over book depreciation a favorable foreign translation adjustment of 08 million increased the deferred tax asset’s carrying value in addition the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations 

no provision has been made for united states state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 121 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

in fiscal 2005 we repatriated approximately 256 million of earnings which were not subject to mexican withholding tax and could be applied against united states net operating loss carryforwards resulting in no united states income tax we provide for united states income tax on current earnings attributable to our operations in mexico 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

fiscal 2006 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations to replace existing or maturing debt instruments purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

our cash and cash equivalent balances increased by 202 million to 1367 million at september 29 2006 from 1165 million at september 30 2005 cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments decreased by 647 million to 1712 million at september 29 2006 from 2359 million at september 30 2005 the number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 decreased to 73 from 82 as compared to fiscal 2005 partially due to the recording of allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the exit of our baseband product area 

during fiscal 2006 we generated 272 million in cash from operating activities offsetting these positive operating cash flows were net losses of 882 million which included total charges incurred to exit our baseband product area we also incurred multiple noncash charges eg depreciation amortization contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans sharebased compensation expense noncash restructuring expense asset impairment charges and provision for deferred income taxes totaling 757 million in fiscal 2006 we also experienced an increase in other accrued liabilities and expenses of 160 million principally related to restructuring accruals in the fourth fiscal quarter and a decrease in deferred tax assets of 165 million and an increase of 312 million in the provision for losses on accounts receivable principally related to the reserves recorded on two baseband customers these increases were offset by uses of cash caused by increases of 182 million in accounts receivable and 35 million in inventory however on a net basis accounts receivable actually declined by 130 million when accounting for the impact of the aforementioned 312 million increase in the provision for losses on accounts receivable 

during fiscal 2006 we generated 424 million in cash from investing activities cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 consisted of net proceeds of 852 million from the sale of auction rate securities and proceeds received from the sale of a building and land of 66 million capital expenditures of 494 million offset these amounts and were primarily related to the purchase of equipment utilized to support an anticipated expanded level of highly integrated product demand requiring more technologically enhanced manufacturing capacity 

the proceeds from the net sales of our auction rate securities were utilized in part to retire 507 million of our junior notes we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 

during fiscal 2006 we utilized 494 million in cash from financing activities this principally resulted from the retirement of 507 million in our junior notes and the pledge of 03 million in cash on a new insurance policy offset by stock option exercises of 17 million as of september 29 2006 our facility agreement of 500 million is fully drawn our junior notes of approximately 1793 million become due in november 2007 we paid approximately 137 million in interest to service this debt during fiscal 2006 for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the exit of the baseband product area we anticipate making cash payments of approximately 256 million in future periods we anticipate the majority of these payments will be remitted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007 we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments will be sufficient to fund these costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area 

fiscal 2005 

during fiscal 2005 we generated 542 million in cash from operating activities this was principally attributable to increased revenues and lower overall operating expenses combined with reduced interest expense and higher other income primarily interest income noncash charges including depreciation charge in lieu of income tax expense amortization and contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans totaled 628 million this was offset by a reduction in liabilities of 211 million primarily related to payment of prior year incentive compensation annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 62 inventory management remained an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements other decreases to cash provided by operating activities resulted from a net increase in our receivable balances of 188 million offset by bad debt provisions of 51 million the increase in accounts receivable balances is due to the timing and collection of customer receivables the timing of purchasing patterns by our customers in our industry affects the timing of our revenue recognition and our collections and is one of the principal reasons for the increase in days sales outstanding from 66 at the end of fiscal 2004 to 82 at the end of fiscal 2005 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 consisted of 283 million of net investments in auction rate securities and capital expenditures of 381 million 

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 consisted of 52 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options there were no changes to the longterm and shortterm debt balances in fiscal 2005 

fiscal 2004 

during fiscal 2004 we focused our efforts on both cash and inventory management days sales outstanding in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was 66 annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 66 during fiscal 2004 we also converted our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest incurred on these senior subordinated notes 

in fiscal 2004 we generated 919 million in cash from operating activities this was principally attributable to net revenues in fiscal 2004 of 7840 million primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio more specifically we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence in addition we reduced research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 319 in fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2004 we invested 600 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly 

integrated products and processes enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers’ demands in fiscal 2004 we made net investments of approximately 810 million in shortterm auction rate securities 

cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily represents an increase in borrowings under our 500 million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank na 

contractual cash flows 

following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt purchase agreements operating leases other commitments and longterm liabilities at september 29 2006 see notes 7 and 11 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in thousands 

 

 

 based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations to replace existing or maturing debt instruments purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue from license fees and intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable and all other criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” have been met we ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products a reserve for 

sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market the company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the recoverability of inventories is assessed through an ongoing review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of twelve months the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 

once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required some or all of the inventories that have been writtendown may be retained and made available for sale in the event that actual demand is higher than originally projected a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the future inventories that have been writtendown and are identified as obsolete are generally scrapped 

sharebased compensation 

on october 1 2005 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options employee stock purchases related to the company’s 2002 employee stock purchase plan restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values sfas 123r supersedes the company’s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006 in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “share based payment” “sab 107” providing interpretative guidance relating to sfas 123r the company has applied the provisions of sab 107 in its adoption of sfas 123r 

the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of october 1 2005 the first day of the company’s fiscal year 2006 

the company’s practice in general is to issue shares of common stock upon exercise or settlement of options and to issue shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan “espp” from previously unissued shares

sharebased compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of sharebased payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period sharebased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 included compensation expense for sharebased payment awards granted on or before but not yet vested as of september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas 123 and compensation expense for the sharebased payment awards granted subsequent to september 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r as sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

upon adoption of sfas 123r the company elected to retain its method of valuation for sharebased awards using the blackscholes optionpricing model “blackscholes model” which was also previously used for the company’s pro forma information required under sfas 123 the company’s determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

sfas 123r requires the company to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in conjunction with calculating sharebased compensation expense these assumptions include the expected life of a stock option or other equity based award expected volatility prevesting forfeiture risk free rate and expected dividend yield all of these assumptions affect to one degree or another the valuation of the company’s equity based awards or the recognition of the resulting sharebased compensation expense the most significant assumptions in the company’s calculations are described below 

expected life of an option or other equity based award 

since employee options are nontransferable sfas 123r allows the use of an expected life to more accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual term 

the vesting of the majority of the company’s stock options are graded over four years 25 at each anniversary and the contractual term is either 7 years or 10 years the company analyzed its historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group the company analyzed the following three exercise metrics exercise at full vesting exercise at midpoint in the contractual life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term the company chose the midpoint alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of its employee population the valuation and resulting sharebased compensation expense recorded is sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could result in a material difference in the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

expected volatility 

expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period sfas 123r does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life implied volatilities the length of time a stock has been publicly traded regular intervals for price observations corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion the company analyzed its volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of 50 to historical volatility and 50 to implied volatility as measured by examining the underlying volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options would provide the best estimate of expected future volatility of the stock price the selection of another methodology to calculate volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

prevesting forfeiture 

sfas 123r specifies that initial accruals of sharebased compensation expense should be based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered the company examined its options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture percentage the company determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience the application of a different methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of sharebased compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 

valuation of longlived assets 

carrying values for longlived assets and definite lived intangible assets which excludes goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance the company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to the company’s business model or changes in its operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group the company recognizes an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company’s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value the company calculates fair value using the average market price of its common stock over a sevenday period surrounding the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the annual impairment test the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination if the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

income taxes 

the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the carrying value of the company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company’s consolidated statement of operations management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly likewise in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period such determination was made 

it was the company’s intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of all its foreign subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes — special areas” during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company reversed its policy of permanently reinvesting the earnings of its mexican business this policy reversal increased the 2005 tax provision by 90 million for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 us income tax was provided on current earnings attributable to our operations in mexico no provision has been made for us federal state or additional foreign income taxes that would be due upon the actual or deemed distribution of undistributed earnings of the other foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are subject to market risks such as changes in currency and interest rates that arise from normal business operation our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm debt and longterm debt our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital consequently we invest 

with only highcreditquality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of september 29 2006 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 

our shortterm debt primarily consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na as of september 29 2006 we had borrowings of 500 million outstanding under this credit facility interest related to our shortterm debt is at libor plus 04 and was approximately 57 at september 29 2006 consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our shortterm debt 

we issued fixedrate debt which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interestrate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interestrate environment and the price of the underlying common stock for the year ended september 29 2006 our convertible debt on an ifconverted basis was not dilutive and as a result had no impact on our net income loss per share assuming dilution in future periods the debt may be converted or the ifconverted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced our longterm debt consists of 1793 million of 475 unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our longterm debt 

based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september 29 2006 a nearterm change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in various foreign countries we do not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our foreign subsidiaries we estimate that we do not have any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk

introduction 

skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is an industry leader in radio solutions and precision analog semiconductors servicing a diversified set of mobile communications customers our frontend modules radio solutions and multimode transceivers are at the heart of many of today’s leadingedge multimedia handsets and wireless networking platforms skyworks also offers a portfolio of highly innovative linear products supporting a wide range of applications including automotive broadband consumer industrial infrastructure medical military radio frequency identification “rfid” satellite and wireless data 

skyworks was formed through the merger “merger” of the wireless business of conexant systems inc “conexant” and alpha industries inc “alpha” on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 and amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha conexant and washington sub inc “washington” a whollyowned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business pursuant to the merger washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving corporation immediately following the merger alpha purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations the “mexicali operations” for purposes of this annual report on form 10k the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as “washingtonmexicali” shortly thereafter alpha which was incorporated in delaware in 1962 changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

we are headquartered in woburn massachusetts and have executive offices in irvine california we have design engineering manufacturing marketing sales and service facilities throughout asia europe and north america our internet address is wwwskyworksinccom we make available on our website free of charge our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k section 16 filings on forms 3 4 and 5 and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically submit such material with the securities and exchange commission “sec” the information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k 

industry background 

we believe that the wireless industry is on the verge of another growth cycle according to deutsche bank handset sales will have increased approximately 100 between 2001 and 2005 with volumes expected to reach 772 million units in 2005 and are expected to grow to nearly 1 billion units by 2008 today the worldwide penetration rate of wireless devices is less than 30 given the low subscriber adoption rates in some of the world’s largest countries such as china and india it is anticipated that approximately 993 million new subscribers will begin using wireless services over the next five years bringing the worldwide subscriber base to nearly 29 billion people by 2008 – or roughly 37 of the world’s population 

at that same time handset growth is also being driven by replacement units purchased by existing subscribers as carriers introduce updated models smaller form factors added features and new multimedia applications more specifically traditional voice services offered by wireless carriers are being rapidly supplemented or augmented by the emergence of nextgeneration features such as cameras tvs video gaming web browsing and wifibased 80211 wireless data applications as more and more features emerge within the handset higher levels of semiconductor integration and power efficient architectures are required furthermore many services will be offered simultaneously and over different frequencies requiring agile multimode operability 

meanwhile outside of the handset market wireless technologies are rapidly proliferating as they are the critical link between the analog and digital worlds core analog technology allows for the detection measurement amplification and conversion of temperature pressure and audio information into the digital realm according to the semiconductor industry association the total available market for the analog semiconductor segment was 32 billion in 2005 and is expected to approach 50 billion in 2008 today this adjacent analog semiconductor market which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and higher gross margins is highly fragmented and diversified among various endmarkets customer bases and applications 

we believe that these market trends create a potentially significant opportunity for a broadbased semiconductor supplier with a comprehensive product portfolio based on radio frequency and analog technologies 

skyworks’ strategy 

skyworks’ vision is to become the premier supplier of radio solutions and precision analog semiconductors for mobile communications applications key elements in our strategy include 

leveraging core technologies 

skyworks deploys technology building blocks such as radio frequency integrated circuits analogmixedsignal processing cores and digital baseband interfaces across multiple product platforms we believe that this approach creates economies of scale in research and development and facilitates a reduction in the time to market for key products 

increasing integration levels 

high levels of integration enhance the benefits of our products by reducing production costs through the use of fewer external components reduced board space and improved system assembly yields by combining all of the integral functionality skyworks can deliver additional semiconductor content thereby offering existing and potential customers more compelling and costeffective solutions 

capturing an increasing amount of semiconductor content 

we enable our customers to start with individual components as necessary and then migrate up the product integration ladder we believe that our highly integrated solutions will enable these customers to improve their timetomarket while focusing their resources on product differentiation through a broader range of more sophisticated nextgeneration features 

focusing on a leadership customer base 

skyworks supports every toptier wireless handset original equipment manufacturer “oem” including nokia corporation motorola inc samsung electronics co sony ericsson mobile communications ab and lg electronics inc at the same time we are diversifying our customer base as we introduce highly innovative linear products in support of medical automotive consumer and broadband applications we believe that the efficiency learned from working with highly agile handset market leaders will prove to be a competitive advantage in these newly addressed market areas 

delivering operational excellence 

the skyworks operations team leverages worldclass manufacturing technologies and enables highly integrated modules as well as systemlevel solutions skyworks strategy is to vertically integrate where it can differentiate or will otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leadingedge capabilities these partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership and competitive advantage in the marketplace we are focused on achieving the industry’s shortest cycle times highest yields and ultimately the lowest cost structure 

business framework 

to address the wireless industry opportunities discussed above and to execute our strategy we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios that when coupled with key customer relationships with all major handset manufacturers positions us well to meet industry needs

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

we own or are licensed under numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products our manufacturing operations and processes and other activities in addition we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services we believe that intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies devices algorithms and processes we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies devices algorithms or processes in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and effective copyright patent trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions in addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain crosslicenses of intellectual property from others to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us due to rapid technological changes in the industry we believe that establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel 

competitive conditions 

we compete on the basis of timetomarket new product innovation overall product quality and performance price compliance with industry standards strategic relationships with customers and protection of our intellectual property certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers resellers suppliers or other third parties these relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 

research and development 

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies our research and development expenditures for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 were 1522 1526 and 1561 million respectively 

raw materials 

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources we do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders however we have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels we also deliver product to certain external customer “hubs” consignment where our significant customers will pull inventory from their existing consignment inventories when required these consignment pulls trigger revenue recognition and we periodically replenish these inventory levels 

environmental regulations 

federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims has been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

most of our european customers have mandated that our products comply with local and regional lead free and other “green” initiatives we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

cyclicality seasonality 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change product obsolescence price erosion evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand these and other factors together with changes in general economic conditions may cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business we have experienced periods of industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these factors may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

sales of our products are also subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets this generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the end of the calendar year

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ substantially and adversely from those referred to herein due to a number of factors including but not limited to those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is an industry leader in radio solutions and precision analog semiconductors servicing a diversified set of mobile communications customers our frontend modules radio solutions and multimode transceivers are at the heart of many of today’s leadingedge multimedia handsets and wireless networking platforms skyworks also offers a portfolio of highly innovative linear products supporting a wide range of applications including automotive broadband consumer industrial infrastructure medical military radio frequency identification “rfid” satellite and wireless data 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand in the past average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future our operating results have been and our operating results may continue to be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors such as changes in demand for enduser equipment the timing of the receipt reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders the gain or loss of significant customers market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products our ability to develop introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis availability and cost of products from suppliers new product and technology introductions by competitors changes in the mix of products produced and sold intellectual property disputes the 

timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to pay warranty claims replace products or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer’s products containing our parts 

business framework 

to address the wireless industry opportunities discussed above and execute to our strategy we have aligned our product portfolio around two markets mobile platforms and linear products we believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios that when coupled with key customer relationships with all major handset manufacturers positions us well to meet industry needs

on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 as amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha industries inc “alpha” conexant systems inc “conexant” and washington sub inc “washington” a whollyowned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park california but excluding certain assets and liabilities washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity the “merger” immediately following the merger we purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations the “mexicali operations” the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to herein as “washingtonmexicali” following the merger alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on october 3 2003 and fiscal years 2005 and 2004 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 30 2005 and october 1 2004 respectively for convenience the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 

general 

during fiscal 2005 certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations more specifically we 

 

 

results of operations 

years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 

the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 

net revenues 

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products and system solutions to leading original equipment manufacturers “oems” of communication electronics products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors 

net revenues increased slightly overall in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of increased demand in our rf product area revenues in aggregate dollars from our highly integrated complex rf products more than doubled between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 this increase in revenues was partially offset by an overall decrease in average selling prices in nearly all of our product areas additionally cellular systems revenue in aggregate dollars declined 139 and revenues from test and assembly declined by 63 due to the termination of the test and assembly services arrangement with conexant our revenues from the test and assembly business averaged 100 million per quarter in fiscal 2004 and were 50 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2005 we fulfilled our manufacturing support obligation to conexant on june 30 2005 

net revenues increased for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as the result of increased demand for our wireless product portfolio more specifically we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence additionally power amplifiers frontend modules rf subsystems and complete cellular systems exhibited strong yearoveryear growth these increases in net revenues were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices primarily within our single function products and a decrease of approximately 15 million in net revenues for our assembly and test services as demand for these services declined in fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2004 the number of units we sold increased by approximately 53 when compared to fiscal 2003 however our average selling price across all products decreased in the aggregate by approximately 17 when compared to the previous fiscal year

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years see note 15 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross profit 

 

gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 

gross profit for fiscal 2005 decreased by 54 million and gross profit margin decreased from 399 to 388 from fiscal 2004 the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to 1 continued additional costs associated with the ongoing launch of a number of our more highly integrated products 2 an unfavorable shift in product mix in the fourth fiscal quarter and 3 a one time payment to a customer of 32 million in the fourth fiscal quarter a decline in the assembly and test services provided to conexant in conjunction with fixed overhead and manufacturing costs in the assembly and test area also contributed to the decreased gross profit margin between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 

gross profit for fiscal 2004 benefited from increased operational efficiency through capacity utilization when compared to the previous fiscal year this benefit was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in average selling prices and additional costs we incurred as we launched and ramped a number of more highly integrated rf product offerings including our frontend modules and single package radios 

research and development 

 

research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 

research and development expenses in fiscal 2005 declined slightly when compared to fiscal 2004 the decline is principally due to decreased incentive compensation costs we remain committed to streamlining and focusing product development efforts on nextgeneration highly integrated products to meet the needs of our customers 

we also reduced research and development expenditures in our cellular systems product area more specifically we focused our product development on core frontend modules rf subsystems infrastructure and nextgeneration solutions research and development expenses were lower in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year as we realized benefits from cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service etc sales representative commissions advertising and other marketing costs 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of 48 million between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 additionally costs incurred to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 contributed to the increase the increased bad debt expense and sarbanesoxley fees were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation costs and legal costs due to the settlement of an intellectual property lawsuit 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 5 million in legal expenses related to protecting our intellectual property portfolio in addition we incurred incentive related compensation expenses in fiscal 2004 which were not incurred in fiscal 2003 we tie incentive compensation to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives each fiscal year and met these objectives in fiscal 2004 whereas these objectives were not met in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 we also incurred information systems conversion costs whereas these expenses were not incurred in fiscal 2003 we transitioned our information systems services from conexant systems inc to a thirdparty service provider during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 these increases in selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year were partially offset by realization of the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years 

amortization of intangible assets and warrants 

 

in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets 

the decrease in amortization expense on intangible assets between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 is the result of 08 million in amortization expense recognized on certain warrants in 2004 while only 02 million was recognized in fiscal 2005 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we wrote down certain intangible assets related to our infrastructure business based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to a decline in demand for and a decision to discontinue certain infrastructure products this writedown established a new cost basis for these assets and resulted in a decrease in amortization expense for fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 

for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

special charges 

 

no special charges were recorded in fiscal 2005 

special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities as follows 

  asset impairments 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a 132 million charge primarily related to the impairment of obsolete baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the merger the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to the decision to discontinue certain products and the related impact on its current and projected outlook management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets 

intangible assets machinery and equipment was impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products salvage value since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 260 million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain infrastructure products manufactured in our woburn massachusetts and adamstown maryland facilities the woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology our adamstown maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components we experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook we projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets machinery equipment and intangible assets may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a fiveyear period since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 16 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets the anticipated pretax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be 53 million from fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008 and 86 million from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2023 we realized actual savings from this asset impairment of 121 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005 this amount related to depreciation expense that was not recorded due to the impairment of the assets 

in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge for the impairment of our haverhill massachusetts property based on a third party estimate of its fair value in fiscal 2003 we relocated our operations from this facility to our woburn massachusetts facility in march 2004 we entered into a contractual arrangement for the sale of the property contingent upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals as of september 30 2005 the prospective buyer with our approval had received a portion of these regulatory approvals and anticipates receiving the remaining regulatory approval in 2006 if the prospective buyer does not receive all regulatory approvals by june 30 2006 the prospective buyer has the option of terminating the original contract alternatively the prospective buyer can renegotiate or extend the original contract with our approval 

  restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2004 we consolidated cellular systems software design centers in an effort to improve our overall timeto market for nextgeneration multimedia systems development these actions aligned our structure with our current business environment we implemented reductions in force at three remote facilities and recorded restructuring charges of approximately 42 million for costs related to severance benefits for affected employees and lease obligations substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid as of september 30 2005 

during fiscal 2003 we recorded 62 million in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation facility sales and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid as of september 30 2005 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is comprised principally of payments on our 500 million credit facility “facility agreement” and junior notes payable 

the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2005 when compared to the previous fiscal year is due to the conversion of our 45 million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during fiscal 2004 specifically we recorded 125 million in interest expense and deferred financing costs amortization on our 230 million junior notes payable and 21 million in interest expense on our 50 million line of credit facility 

the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily related to the conversion of our 45 million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 on april 22 2004 we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may 12 2004 on may 6 2004 the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 57 million shares of our common stock we paid interest in cash on the senior notes on the last business day of each march june september and december of each year interest paid on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature 

for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

other income net 

 

other income net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances foreign exchange gainslosses and other nonoperating income and expense items 

the increase in other income net between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher levels of interest bearing shortterm investments in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and higher average interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

the increase in other income net between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily due to higher levels of interest bearing shortterm investments in fiscal 2004 and slightly higher shortterm interest rates 

provision for income taxes 

 

based upon a history of significant operating losses management has determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with the mexicali operations in the postmerger period consequently no u s income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses as of september 30 2005 we established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets 

during fiscal 2005 we reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets by 37 million relating to the tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2002 for the impairment of our assembly and test machinery and equipment in mexicali mexico in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 a charge of 22 million resulted from a reduction of the statutory income tax rate in mexico deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a charge of 23 million related to normal amortization of 

the tax benefit for tax over book depreciation a favorable foreign translation adjustment of 08 million increased the deferred tax asset’s carrying value 

in addition the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 consists of approximately 111 million and 10 million respectively of us income taxes recorded as a charge reducing the carrying value of goodwill no benefit has been recognized for utilizing certain premerger deferred tax assets the utilization of these deferred items reduces the carrying value of goodwill ie charge in lieu of tax expense instead of reducing income tax expense we will evaluate the realization of the premerger deferred tax assets periodically and adjust the provision for income taxes accordingly as a result the effective tax rate may vary in subsequent periods 

no provision has been made for united states federal state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 116 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

in fiscal 2005 our subsidiary in mexico dividended approximately 256 million of earnings to the united states such earnings which were not subject to mexico withholding tax and could be applied against us net operating loss carryforwards resulted in no significant us income tax expense earnings of our mexico subsidiary are no longer considered permanently reinvested and accordingly us income taxes are provided on current earnings attributable to our earnings in mexico 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

 

we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill as a result we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and is reflected in our results of operations as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2005 and determined that as of july 5 2005 our goodwill was not impaired 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

fiscal 2005 

during fiscal 2005 we generated 542 million in cash from operating activities this was principally attributable to increased revenues and lower overall operating expenses combined with reduced interest expense and higher other income primarily interest income noncash charges including depreciation charge in lieu of income tax expense amortization and contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans totaled 628 million this was offset by a reduction in liabilities of 211 million primarily related to payment of prior year incentive compensation annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 62 inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements other decreases to cash provided by operating activities resulted from an net increase in our receivable balances of 188 million offset by bad debt provisions of 51 million the increase in accounts receivable balances is due to the timing and collection of customer receivables the timing of purchasing patterns by our customers in our industry affects the timing of our revenue recognition and our collections and is one of the principal reasons for the increase in days sales outstanding from 66 at the end of fiscal 2004 to 82 at the end of fiscal 2005 

in october 2005 we were notified by vitelcom mobile one of our tier three customers that it had sustained significant weather related damage to one of its manufacturing facilities in mexico due to the business interruption caused by this event the customer notified us that it would defer making cash payments on a previously arranged payment plan while we currently anticipate that this receivable will ultimately be collectible the customer nevertheless is not making timely payments on the amounts owed to us and thus our near term cash payments from this customer remain uncertain 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 consisted of 283 million of net investments in auction rate securities and capital expenditures of 381 million we anticipate our capital expenditures will approximate 40 million in fiscal 2006 we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 consisted of 52 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options we have shortterm debt which consists of a 50 million credit facility and longterm debt which consists of a 230 million 475 convertible subordinated note payable which will become due in november 2007 there were no changes to the longterm and shortterm debt balances in fiscal 2005 we expect to maintain these balances through fiscal 2006 for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2004 

during fiscal 2004 we made progress in several key areas as we focused our efforts on both cash and inventory management we significantly reduced the number of days sales outstanding in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to 66 from 88 for the same period in the previous fiscal year annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 66 during fiscal 2004 we also converted our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest incurred on these senior subordinated notes 

in fiscal 2004 we generated 919 million in cash from operating activities as we experienced a significant improvement in our operating results when compared to the previous fiscal year this improvement was primarily attributable to increased net revenues in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio more specifically we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence in addition we reduced research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 319 in fiscal 2004 from 391 for the previous fiscal year during fiscal 2004 we invested 600 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly integrated products and processes enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers’ demands in fiscal 2004 we made net investments of approximately 81 million in shortterm auction rate securities 

cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily represents an increase in borrowings under our 50 million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank na

fiscal 2003 

cash used in operating activities was 721 million for fiscal 2003 reflecting a net loss of 4514 million offset by noncash charges primarily asset impairments depreciation and amortization of 4892 million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately 1099 million including 400 million of mergerrelated expense payments as of september 30 2003 substantially all amounts accrued for mergerrelated expenses had been paid we adopted sfas no 142 on october 1 2002 and recorded a 3971 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 403 million the capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 represented our continued investment in production and test facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 also included 40 million of purchases of shortterm investments our shortterm investments were classified as heldtomaturity and consisted primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days and less than twelve months 

on august 11 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec with respect to the issuance of up to 250 million aggregate principal amount of securities including debt securities common or preferred shares warrants or any combination thereof this registration statement which the sec declared effective on august 28 2003 provides us with greater flexibility and access to capital on september 9 2003 we issued 92 million shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 included approximately 1022 million of net proceeds from this offering we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 also included the net impact of our private placement of 230 million of 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 and related debt refinancing with conexant on november 13 2002 these subordinated notes could be converted into 1104911 shares of common stock per 1000 principal balance which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately 905 per share the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay 105 million of the 150 million debt to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and to prepay the 65 million principal amount outstanding as of november 13 2002 under a separate loan facility with conexant in connection with our prepayment of 105 million of the 150 million debt owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations the remaining 45 million principal balance was exchanged for new 15 convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date of june 30 2005 on april 22 2004 we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may 12 2004 on may 6 2004 the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 57 million shares of our common stock in addition to the retirement of 170 million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant we also retained approximately 53 million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs in addition as of september 30 2003 we had borrowings outstanding of 417 million under our 50 million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank na 

contractual cash flows 

following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt purchase agreements and operating leases at september 30 2005 see notes 7 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements in thousands 

 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2005 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the 

future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories 

we assess the recoverability of inventories through an ongoing review of inventory levels relative to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of six months we write down the value of those excess inventories in determining the net realizable value of our inventories we review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old and therefore subject to obsolescence we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or market once established writedowns of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory we sell our products to communications equipment original equipment manufacturers “oems” that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle which includes providing technical support to the oem customer in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins consequently when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected additional inventory writedowns may be required 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

carrying values for longlived assets and definitelived intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with sfas no 144 which was adopted on october 1 2002 impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 which was adopted on october 1 2002 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter july 1 and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 

deferred income taxes 

we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations the future realization of certain deferred tax assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill the portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately 32 million we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly in fiscal 2002 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 23 million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets a valuation allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period 

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue from license fees is recognized when these fees are due and payable and all other criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 — revenue recognition “sab 104” have been met revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” the amendments made by sfas no 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as currentperiod charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 will have a material impact on its financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires that the compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions be recognized in financial statements that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued sfas no 123r covers a wide range of sharebased compensation arrangements including share options restricted share plans performancebased awards share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123 as originally issued in 1995 established as preferable a fairvaluebased method of accounting for sharebased payment transactions with employees however that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 25 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fairvaluebased method been used public entities other than those filing as small business issuers were initially required to apply sfas no 123r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 in april 2005 the sec issued a rule amending the compliance date which allows companies to implement sfas no 123r at the beginning of their next fiscal year instead of the next reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 as a result we will implement sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method starting october 1 2005 under this method the company will begin recognizing compensation cost for equitybased compensation for all new and existing unvested sharebased awards after the date of adoption the company will also be required to recognize compensation expense for the fair value of the discount and option features provided to employees on all shares issued through its employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of sfas no 123r under the provisions of sfas no 123r the company anticipates it will recognize 255 million as compensation expense in fiscal years 2006 thru 2011 this assumes the current blackscholes valuation assumptions at september 30 2005 remain constant in future periods it also does not take into account future adjustments to compensation expense due to actual cancellations or new awards granted 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb opinion no 29” the guidance in apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged the guidance in apb opinion no 29 however included certain exceptions to that principle sfas no 153 amends apb opinion no 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 is effective for such exchange transactions occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not believe the impact of adopting sfas no 153 will have a material impact on its financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” introduces a special 9 tax deduction on qualified production activities fsp no 1091 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas no 109 the company does not expect the adoption of fsp no 1091 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of its historical net operating loss carryforwards 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the ajca introduces for a limited time an 85 dividend deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision provided certain criteria are met fsp 1092 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision the company does not expect the adoption of fsp no 1092 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of its historical net operating loss carryforwards 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” this interpretation provides additional guidance as to when companies should record the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when there is uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement of the obligation the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this issue on its financial statements but does not believe the impact of any change if necessary will be material fasb interpretation no 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” this statement replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements—an amendment of apb opinion no 28” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes in an accounting principle it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions those provisions should be followed sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

other matters 

inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the threeyear period ended september 30 2005 

certain business risks 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect our future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards from time to time changes in general economic conditions together with other factors cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these characteristics and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations furthermore downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints which may affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 

our operating results for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were adversely affected by a global economic slowdown decreased consumer confidence reduced capital spending and adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries these factors led to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions although we emerged from this period of economic weakness in fiscal 2004 should economic conditions deteriorate for any reason it could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix and other impacts that would materially and adversely affect our operating results due to this economic uncertainty although we were profitable in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such profitability or that we will not experience future operating losses 

additionally the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts natural disasters acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest contributes to the economic uncertainty these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen or both our business financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 

as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share furthermore some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufacture products similar to ours and may compete with us we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the accounting treatment of stockbased compensation will adversely affect our results of operations 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” to require companies to expense employee stock options for financial reporting purposes effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 such stock option expensing will require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option 

valuation formula and amortize that value against our earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options we currently account for stockbased awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and have adopted the disclosureonly alternative of sfas no 123r “accounting for stockbased compensation” in april 2005 the sec issued a rule amending the compliance date which allows companies to implement sfas 123r at the beginning of their next fiscal year instead of the next reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 as a result we implemented sfas 123r in the reporting period starting october 1 2005 when we are required to expense employee stock options in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 this change in accounting treatment will materially affect our reported results of operations as the stockbased compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings but will have no impact on cash flows from operations we anticipate that our stockbased compensation expense will approximate 255 million in fiscal 2006 through 2011 this expense projection is calculated as of september 30 2005 and does not taken into account any future equity awards that we might issue nor does it account for future actual stockbased award forfeitures we will be required to adjust future stockbased compensation expense for actual future stock option forfeitures 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 

our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to pay warranty claims replace products or pay costs associated with the recall of a customer’s products containing our parts 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may include electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism health advisories or risks or other natural or manmade disasters disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity we also utilize subcontractors to package assemble and test our products there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

 

although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities to the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and in particular the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration increased miniaturization and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors including 

 

our ability to manufacture current products and to develop new products depends among other factors on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems “it systems” we upgrade and change our it systems from time to time and recently completed a system upgrade and there can be no assurance that such upgrade will be successful 

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and 

introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface if we fail to rapidly and costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 

in addition prices of many of our products decline sometimes significantly over time we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 

the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics 

 

these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the abovenoted factors 

the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

if oems and odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products are not sold directly to the enduser but are components or subsystems of other products as a result we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related 

revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom have rights to return unsold products we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products our business would be materially and adversely affected sales to our three largest customers including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors represented approximately 384 of our net revenue for fiscal 2005 we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in fiscal 2006 and for the foreseeable future 

average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short  

in the semiconductor industry product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles therefore the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover and we are not able to compensate for those expenses our operating results would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory our operating results would be harmed 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on september 30 2005 we had total indebtedness of approximately 280 million which represented approximately 27 of our total capitalization 

as long as our 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 remain outstanding we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately 10925000 per year in interest payments if we issue other debt securities in the future our debt service obligations will increase if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 

we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash expected to be generated by our operations and from our existing cash and investments if necessary among other alternatives we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other longterm debt lines of credit and other financing 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

 

despite our current debt levels we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

we may need to obtain sources of financing in the future we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing conditions existing in the us capital markets if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital as well as the terms of any such financing we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 

a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have design centers and suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

 

 

additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

 

the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock  

global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

global economic weakness can have wideranging effects on markets that we serve particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators although the wireless communications industry has recovered somewhat from an industrywide recession such recovery may not continue in addition we cannot predict what effects negative events such as war or other international conflicts may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties further a continued economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term if it does not our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widelyused process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it 

any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

 

we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 

we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

 

despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion even if we receive a patent the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology furthermore even if we receive patent protection in the united states we may not seek or may not be granted patent protection in foreign countries in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

there is a growing industry trend to include or adapt “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its developers authors or third parties often such software includes license provisions requiring public disclosure of any derivative works containing open source code there is little legal precedent in the area of open source software or its effects on 

copyright law or the protection of proprietary works we take steps to avoid the use of open source works in our proprietary software and are taking steps to limit our suppliers from doing so however in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate in court that we have not complied with a software license we may be required to cease production or distribution of that work or to publicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software which may negatively affect our operations or stock price 

we attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational technological and legal safeguards despite our efforts parties including former or current employees may attempt to copy disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization furthermore attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations while we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information 

our success depends in part on our ability to effect suitable investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire 

although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we intend to review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

 

moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings for instance we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the amount of 3971 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

 

 

directors and in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5 or more of our shares a majority of the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5 or more of our shares 

 

in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 

increasingly stringent environmental laws rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to costeffectively produce our products 

the semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmental regulations a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances a number of which have been used in our products or processes for example the european union restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components by july 1 2006 removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances as well as increased testing by thirdparties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the rohs directive alternative substances may not be readily available or commercially feasible may only be available from a single source or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts while we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations if we are unable to complete the transition in a timely manner or ensure consistent quality and product yields with redesigned processes our operations may be adversely affected 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states and in foreign countries we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities furthermore our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future accordingly you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 

the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

 

public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in addition fluctuations in our stock price volume of shares traded and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis our company has been and in the future may be the subject of commentary by financial news media such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline possibly substantially over a short period of time accordingly you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risks such as changes in currency and interest rates that arise from normal business operation our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm debt and longterm debt our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital consequently we invest with only highcreditquality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of september 30 2005 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 

our shortterm debt primarily consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na as of september 30 2005 we had borrowings of 500 million outstanding under this credit facility interest related to our shortterm debt is at libor plus 04 and was approximately 42 at september 30 2005 consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our shortterm debt 

we issued fixedrate debt which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interestrate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interestrate environment and the price of the underlying common stock for the year ended september 30 2005 our convertible debt on an ifconverted basis was not dilutive and as a result had no impact on our net income per share assuming dilution in future periods the debt may be converted or the ifconverted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced our longterm debt consists of 230 million of 475 unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our longterm debt 

based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september 30 2005 a nearterm change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in various foreign countries we do not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our foreign subsidiaries we estimate that we do not have any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that skyworks solutions inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion skyworks solutions inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso

summary compensation table 

 

 

 the following tables provide information about stock options granted to and exercised by each of the named executives in fiscal year 2005 if any and the value of options held by each at september 30 2005 

option grants in last fiscal year individual grants 

 

the options vest at a rate of 25 per year commencing one year after the date of grant provided the holder of the option remains employed by the company options may not be exercised beyond three months after the holder ceases to be employed by the company except in the event of termination by reason of death or permanent disability in which event the option may be exercised for specific periods not exceeding one year following termination the assumed annual rates of stock price appreciation stated in the table are dictated by regulations of the securities and exchange commission and are compounded annually for the full term of the options these assumptions do not reflect our estimates of future stock price growth and actual outcomes may differ 

aggregated option exercises in last fiscal year and fiscal year end option values 

 

the values of unexercised options in the foregoing table are based on the difference between the 702 closing price of skyworks’ common stock on september 30 2005 the end of the 2005 fiscal year on the nasdaq national market and the respective option exercise price 

stockbased compensation awards 

there were no stockbased compensation awards granted to any of the named executives for fiscal 2005 

executive compensation 

our executives are eligible for awards of nonqualified stock options incentive stock options and restricted stock awards under our applicable stockbased compensation plans these stockbased compensation plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors generally the exercise price at which an executive may purchase skyworks’ common stock pursuant to a stock option is the fair market value of skyworks’ common stock on the date of grant stock options are granted subject to restrictions on vesting with equal portions of the total grant generally vesting over a period of four years our stock options are subject to forfeiture after certain grace periods upon termination of employment disability or death restricted stock awards involve the issuance of shares of common stock that may not be transferred or otherwise encumbered subject to certain exceptions for varying amounts of time and which will be forfeited in whole or in part if the executive terminates his or her employment with skyworks 

the named executives were also eligible to receive target incentive compensation under which a percentage of each executive’s total cash compensation is tied to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives during fiscal year 2005 the company did not achieve the annual performance targets set by the board of directors and therefore no incentive bonuses were paid to the named executives with respect to fiscal year 2005 certain named executives also may participate in the company’s executive compensation plan the “executive compensation plan” an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants may defer a portion of their compensation deferred amounts are held in a trust participants defer recognizing taxable income on the amount held for their benefit until the amounts are paid although the company in its sole discretion may make additional contributions to the accounts of participants it presently has no plans to do so and has never done so in the past participants normally receive the deferred amounts upon retirement 

compensation of directors 

directors who are not employees of skyworks are paid in quarterly installments an annual retainer of 30000 plus an additional 1000 for each board of directors meeting attended in person or 500 for each board of directors meeting attended by telephone effective beginning fiscal year 2005 the chairman of the board of directors is paid an annual retainer of 45000 additional annual retainers are paid to the chairman of the audit committee 9000 the chairman of the compensation committee 6000 and the chairman of the nominating and governance committee 2500 in addition directors who serve on committees in roles other than as chairman are annually paid 3000 audit committee 2000 compensation committee and 1250 nominating and corporate governance committee each new nonemployee director receives an option to purchase 45000 shares of common stock immediately following the earlier of skyworks’ annual meeting of stockholders at which the director is first elected by the stockholders or following his initial appointment by the board of directors additionally following each annual meeting of stockholders each nonemployee director who is continuing in office or reelected receives an option to purchase 15000 shares of common stock the exercise price of stock options granted to directors is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant stock option grants to directors for fiscal years 2002 2003 and 2004 were made under the 2001 directors’ stock option plan 

in connection with his appointment to the board of directors mr mcglade was granted an option to purchase 45000 shares of common stock on february 1 2005 at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant under our directors’ 2001 stock option plan in connection with their continued service on the board of directors each of messrs beebe beguwala decker furey iyer leonard and mclachlan was granted an option to purchase 15000 shares of common stock on april 28 2005 at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 

on june 27 2005 the company’s board of directors modified the terms of certain options to purchase the company’s common stock held by mr donald r beall a former director of the company who retired on april 28 2005 specifically the vesting of 36750 of mr beall’s outstanding stock options was accelerated such that they are now exercisable in addition the exercise period for 73500 of mr beall’s stock options including the 36750 accelerated options discussed above was extended so that instead of expiring on july 28 2005 such options would continue to be exercisable until april 28 2007 the options affected have exercise prices ranging from 624 to 1175 these modifications did not affect 258514 of mr beall’s other outstanding options which were fully vested pursuant to their original terms at the time of his retirement and expire at various times beginning july 28 2005 and ending april 28 2010 in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and fasb interpretation no 44 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation the modification of 13500 of the abovereferenced stock options will not affect the company’s financial statements because the exercise price for such options was higher than the market price of the company’s stock at the modification date therefore the intrinsic value of such stock options was zero at the date of the modification and no additional compensation cost will result the modification of the other 60000 abovereferenced options will result in the company incurring a noncash charge of 57450 since the exercise price for such options was lower than the market price of the company’s stock at the modification date in addition fixed stock option accounting continues to apply to all of the modified stock options because neither the number of stock options nor the exercise price of such stock options was changed as a result of the modification none of the company’s stockbased compensation plans was affected by the aforementioned modifications 

no director who is also an employee receives separate compensation for services rendered as a director david j aldrich is currently the only director who is also an employee of skyworks mr aldrich’s compensation as president and chief executive officer of skyworks is discussed separately in this part iii

industry background 

we believe that the wireless industry is on the verge of another growth cycle traditional voice services offered by wireless carriers are being rapidly supplemented or augmented by the emergence of the nextgeneration wireless technologies and wifibased 80211 wireless data applications all of these new technologies are geared to make highspeed wireless data available on handset pda notebook and other platforms in a variety of environments 

the cellular handset market has grown significantly over the past five years despite the broad technology slowdown in 2001 and 2002 according to market research firm arc group handset sales have increased by approximately 75 from 1999 to 2003 with volume reaching 483 million units in 2003 exiting 2003 the worldwide penetration rate of wireless services was at 22 according to market research firm emc and is expected to climb to 33 by 2006 this increased penetration implies that approximately 750 million new subscribers will begin using wireless services over the next three years approaching the 21 billion worldwide subscriber mark in 2006 — roughly a third of the world’s population 

in parallel handset growth is being driven by replacement units purchased by existing subscribers as carriers introduce updated models smaller form factors added features and new multimedia applications in particular camera phones and multimedia services are expected to be two major growth drivers in the coming years according to the arc group colordisplay phones have become the new standard and majority of new products being introduced incorporate this functionality meanwhile handsets with builtin cameras are forecasted to increase from 59 million units in 2003 to almost 330 million units by 2006 these new wireless phones will also feature higher data rate services driven by 25g and 3g standards such as gprs cdma 2000 edge and wcdma according to arc group the combination of new subscriber additions and higher replacement rates is expected to drive total handset sales from 483 million units in 2003 to approximately 670 million units in 2006 

in response to this rapidly growing market handset original equipment manufacturers or oems are significantly shortening product development cycles seeking simplified architectures and streamlining manufacturing processes traditional oems are shifting to lowcost suppliers around the world in turn original design manufacturers or odms and contract manufacturers who lack rf and systemslevel expertise are entering the highvolume mobile phone market to support oems as well as to develop handset platforms of their own odms and contract manufacturers seek to manage lowcost handset manufacturing and assembly freeing oems to focus on marketing and distribution aspects of their business established handset manufacturers and new market entrants alike are demanding complete semiconductor system solutions that include the rf system all baseband processing protocol stack and user interface software plus comprehensive reference designs and development platforms with these solutions traditional handset oems can accelerate timetomarket cycles with lower investments in engineering and system design these solutions also enable odms to enter the high volume handset market without requiring significant investments in rf and systemslevel expertise 

similarly cellular and personal communications services network operators are developing and deploying nextgeneration services these service providers are incorporating packetswitching capability in their networks to deliver data communications and internet access to digital cellular and other wireless devices over the long term service providers are seeking to establish a global network that can be accessed by subscribers at any time anywhere in the world and that can provide subscribers with multimedia services to meet this goal oems that supply wireless infrastructure base stations to network operators are increasingly relying on mobile communications semiconductor suppliers that can provide highly integrated rf and mixed signal processing functionality 

additionally as service providers migrate cellular subscribers to data intensive nextgeneration applications base stations that transmit and receive signals in the backbone of cellular and personal communications services systems will be under further capacity constraints to meet the related demand oems will be challenged to increase base station transceiver performance and functionality while reducing size power consumption and overall system costs 

we believe that these market trends create a potentially significant opportunity for a broadbased wireless semiconductor supplier with a comprehensive product portfolio supported by specialized wireless manufacturing process technologies and a full range of systemslevel expertise

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies 

our research and development expenditures for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 were 1526 million 1561 million and 1336 million respectively 

raw materials 

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources we do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders however we have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

under supply agreements entered into with conexant and subsequently with jazz semiconductor inc “jazz semiconductor” we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to the terms of these agreements we are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor through march 2005 our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements will be approximately 129 million for fiscal 2005 we currently anticipate meeting our minimum purchase obligation under these supply agreements 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

environmental regulations 

federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

cyclicality seasonality 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change product obsolescence price erosion evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand these and other factors together with changes in general economic conditions may cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business we have experienced periods of industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these factors may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

sales of our products are also subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets this generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the end of the calendar year 

geographic information 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

employees 

as of october 1 2004 the company employed approximately 4200 persons approximately 1100 employees in mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract motivate develop and retain highly skilled and dedicated employees 










 item 2 properties 

we own and lease manufacturing facilities and other real estate properties in the united states and a number of foreign countries for information regarding property plant and equipment by geographic region for each of the last two fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we own and lease approximately 900000 square feet and 100000 square feet respectively of office and manufacturing space in addition we lease approximately 430000 square feet of sales office and design center space with approximately 22 of this space located in foreign countries we are headquartered in woburn massachusetts and have executive offices in irvine california the following table sets forth our principal facilities measuring 50000 square feet or more 

 we believe our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all the equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 

certain of our facilities including our california and mexico facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines we maintain no earthquake insurance with respect to these facilities 

in fiscal 2003 we relocated our operations from our haverhill massachusetts facility to our woburn massachusetts facility we actively marketed the property located in haverhill massachusetts and in march 2004 entered into a contractual agreement for the sale of the property contingent upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals within the next two years 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been and may in the future be instituted or asserted against skyworks including those pertaining to patent infringement intellectual property environmental product liability safety and health employment and contractual matters in addition in connection with the merger skyworks has assumed responsibility for all then current and future litigation including environmental and intellectual property proceedings against conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of conexant’s wireless business the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to skyworks intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which if imposed against skyworks could materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of skyworks 

additionally the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology at the present time the company is in litigation with qualcomm incorporated “qualcomm” regarding claims that both the company and qualcomm filed and first served against each other on december 4 2003 asserting violations of certain of each company’s respective intellectual property rights the company believes qualcomm’s claims are without merit and is vigorously defending against qualcomm’s claims and fully prosecuting its claims against them 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended october 1 2004 

part ii

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors including but not limited to risk factors risks and cautionary statements described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is a leading wireless semiconductor company focused exclusively on radio frequency “rf” and complete cellular system solutions for mobile communications applications we offer frontend modules rf subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results have been and our operating results may continue to be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors such as changes in demand for enduser equipment the timing of the receipt reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders the gain or loss of significant customers market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products our ability to develop introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis availability and cost of products from suppliers new product and technology introductions by competitors changes in the mix of products produced and sold intellectual property disputes the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions in the past average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future 

our strategy 

skyworks’ vision is to become the premier supplier of wireless semiconductor solutions key elements in our strategy include 

leveraging core technologies 

skyworks deploys technology building blocks such as radio frequency integrated circuits analogmixedsignal processing cores and digital baseband engines as well as software across multiple product platforms we believe that this approach creates economies of scale in research and development and facilitates a reduction in the time to market for key products 

increasing integration levels 

high levels of integration enhance the benefits of our products by reducing production costs through the use of fewer external components reduced board space and improved system assembly yields by combining all of the necessary communications functions for a complete system solution skyworks can deliver additional semiconductor content thereby offering existing and potential customers more compelling and costeffective solutions 

capturing an increasing amount of semiconductor content 

we enable our customers to start with individual components as necessary and then migrate up the product integration ladder we believe that our highly integrated solutions will enable these customers to speed their time to market while focusing their resources on product differentiation through a broader range of more sophisticated nextgeneration features

basis of presentation 

on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 as amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha industries inc “alpha” conexant systems inc “conexant” and washington sub inc “washington” a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park california but excluding certain assets and liabilities washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity the “merger” following the merger alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

immediately following completion of the merger the company purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly module manufacturing and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations “mexicali operations” for 150 million for financial accounting purposes the sale of the mexicali operations by conexant to skyworks solutions was treated as if conexant had contributed the mexicali operations to washington as part of the spinoff and the 150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to conexant for purposes of these financial statements the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as washingtonmexicali references to the “company” refer to washingtonmexicali for all periods prior to june 26 2002 and to the combined company following the merger 

the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington was treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree primarily because conexant shareholders owned a majority approximately 67 percent of the company upon completion of the merger under a reverse acquisition the purchase price of alpha was based upon the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha stock options the purchase price of alpha was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by washington as the acquiring company for accounting purposes based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date because the historical financial statements of the company after the merger do not include the historical financial results of alpha for periods prior to june 26 2002 the financial statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of the historical results that would have resulted if the merger had occurred at the beginning of a historical financial period 

we entered into agreements with conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by conexant and for the supply by us of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to conexant initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by conexant from washingtonmexicali we also entered into agreements with conexant and jazz semiconductor providing for the supply to us of siliconbased wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services by jazz semiconductor historically washingtonmexicali obtained a portion of its siliconbased semiconductors from the newport beach wafer fabrication facility that is now owned by jazz semiconductor 

the financial statements prior to the merger were prepared using conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities and the historical operating results of washingtonmexicali during each respective period we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable however the financial information included herein and in our consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the combined assets liabilities operating results and cash flows of the company in the future and is not indicative of what they would have been had washingtonmexicali been a separate standalone entity and independent of conexant during the historical periods presented 

our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on october 3 2003 and fiscal years 2004 and 2002 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on october 1 2004 and september 27 2002 respectively for convenience the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month accordingly references to september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 contained in this discussion refer to our actual fiscal yearend 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts — we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories — we assess the recoverability of inventories through an ongoing review of inventory levels relative to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of six months we write down the value of those excess inventories we sell our products to communications equipment original equipment manufacturers “oems” that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle which includes providing technical support to the oem customer in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins consequently when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected additional inventory writedowns may be required 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets — carrying values for longlived assets and definitelived intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which was adopted on october 1 2002 impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which was adopted on october 1 2002 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 

deferred income taxes — we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations the future realization of certain deferred tax assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill the portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately 43 million we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly in fiscal 2002 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 23 million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets a valuation allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period 

revenue recognition — revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products we reduce revenue to the extent of our estimate for distributor claims of price protection andor right of return on unsold product a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

general 

during fiscal 2004 we made progress in several key areas that contributed to an improvement in operating results and the generation of positive cash flows from operations more specifically we 

      results of operations 

years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 

the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 net revenues 

 we market and sell our semiconductor products and system solutions to leading oems of communication electronics products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors 

net revenues increased for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as the result of increased demand for our wireless product portfolio more specifically we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence additionally power amplifiers frontend modules rf subsystems and complete cellular systems exhibited strong yearoveryear growth these increases in net revenues were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices primarily within our single function products and a decrease of approximately 15 million in net revenues for our assembly and test services as demand for these services declined in fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2004 the number of units we sold increased by approximately 53 when compared to fiscal 2003 however our average selling price across all products decreased in the aggregate by approximately 17 when compared to the previous fiscal year 

net revenues increased in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily reflecting the exclusion of alpha’s revenues for periods prior to the merger and increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio had alpha’s revenue been included for the nine month period prior to the merger net revenue in fiscal 2002 would have been 543 million as compared to the 458 million reported accordingly the majority of the increase in revenue in fiscal 2003 is attributable to the exclusion of alpha’s revenue up to the time of the merger on an operational basis the revenue increase in fiscal 2003 primarily resulted from an increase in the number of rf subsystem units shipped in both gsm and cdma due to the ramping of new product offerings an increase in unit volumes of frontend modules however was offset by a decline in the average selling price of such products in addition lower cdma handset subsidies in korea also adversely affected net revenues in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 in certain global markets wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers ultimately decreasing the cost of the handset to the customer 

for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of the last three fiscal years see note 16 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross profit 

 gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold cost of goods sold for the periods prior to the merger also includes allocations from conexant of manufacturing cost variances process engineering and other manufacturing costs which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as incurred 

gross profit for fiscal 2004 benefited from increased operational efficiency through capacity utilization when compared to the previous fiscal year this benefit was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in average selling prices and additional costs we incurred as we launched and ramped a number of more highly integrated rf product offerings including our frontend modules and single package radios gross profit for fiscal 2003 was favorably affected by 48 million or 70 basis points when we reevaluated our obligation under wafer fabrication supply agreements and reduced our liability and cost of sales at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we estimated that we would not be able to meet our minimum purchase obligation under the wafer supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor accordingly we recorded this liability in cost of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the following external factors contributed to the reductions in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 relating to this liability 

  because of the increase in demand for our products and the annual reduction in our minimum purchase obligations as specified in the agreement the company has met its minimum purchase obligation for each of the periods subsequent to september 30 2002 furthermore the company currently expects to meet the remaining minimum purchase obligations of 129 million for fiscal 2005 and will have no further minimum purchase obligations under the wafer supply agreement subsequent to march 2005 our costs will be affected by the extent of our use of outside foundries and the pricing we are able to obtain during periods of high industry demand for wafer fabrication capacity we may have to pay higher prices to secure wafer fabrication capacity 

the improvement in gross profit in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflects increased revenues improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the writedown of our mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 although revenue growth in fiscal 2003 increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities these facilities continued to operate below optimal capacity and underutilization continued to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross profit 

gross profit in fiscal 2003 was also favorably affected by the aforementioned 48 million reduction to our liability and cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 when we reevaluated our obligation under the wafer supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor 

research and development 

 research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs research and development expenses for the periods prior to the merger also include allocated costs for shared research and development services provided by conexant principally in the areas of advanced semiconductor process development design automation and advanced package development for the benefit of several of conexant’s businesses 

the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily attributable to our commitment to streamlining our processes and focusing our product development on integrated products to meet the needs of our customers in addition research and development expenses were lower in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year as we realized benefits from cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years more specifically we focused our product development on core frontend modules rf subsystems cellular systems infrastructure and next generation solutions 

the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 represents our commitment to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma2000 gsm general packet radio services or gprs and thirdgeneration or 3g wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is also related to our research and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses in 2002 are representative of only washingtonmexicali prior to june 25 2002 

selling general and administrative 

 selling general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service etc sales representative commissions advertising and other marketing costs selling general and administrative expenses also include allocated general and administrative expenses from conexant for the periods prior to the merger for a variety of these shared functions 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 5 million in legal expenses related to protecting our intellectual property portfolio in addition we incurred performance related compensation expenses in fiscal 2004 which were not incurred in fiscal 2003 we tie incentive compensation to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives each fiscal year and met these objectives in fiscal 2004 whereas these objectives were not met in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 we also incurred information systems conversion costs whereas these expenses were not incurred in fiscal 2003 we transitioned our information systems services from conexant systems inc to a thirdparty service provider during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 these increases in selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year were partially offset by realization of the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two fiscal years 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily related to our selling general and administrative expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses for the same period in 2002 are representative of only washingtonmexicali prior to june 25 2002 

amortization of intangible assets 

 in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we wrote down certain intangible assets related to our infrastructure business based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to a decline in demand for and a decision to discontinue certain infrastructure products this writedown established a new cost basis for these assets and resulted in a decrease in amortization expense for fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 

amortization expense for fiscal 2002 primarily represents amortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with washingtonmexicali’s acquisition of philsar semiconductor inc “philsar” in fiscal 2000 philsar was a developer of rf semiconductor solutions for personal wireless connectivity including emerging standards such as bluetooth and rf components for thirdgeneration digital cellular handsets we wrote off all goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the philsar bluetooth business in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the lower amortization expense in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily resulted from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on october 1 2002 had the company ceased amortizing goodwill on october 1 2000 amortization expense would have been 107 million less in fiscal 2002 

for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements  

purchased inprocess research and development 

 in connection with the merger in fiscal 2002 655 million was allocated to purchased inprocess research and development “iprd” and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition as a charge not deductible for tax purposes because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed the charges represent the estimated fair values of the portion of iprd projects that had been completed by alpha at the time of the merger 

for additional information regarding purchased inprocess research and development see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

special charges 

 special charges consists of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities as follows 

asset impairments 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a 132 million charge primarily related to the impairment of obsolete baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the merger this charge includes approximately 18 million of contractual payment obligations which we expect to pay within one year the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in response to the decision to discontinue certain products and the related impact on its current and projected outlook management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets intangible assets machinery and equipment were impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products salvage value since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 260 million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain infrastructure products manufactured in our woburn massachusetts and adamstown maryland facilities the woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology our adamstown maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components we experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook we projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets machinery equipment and intangible assets may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a fiveyear period since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 16 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets the anticipated pretax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be 174 million from fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 and 86 million from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2023 

in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge for the impairment of our haverhill massachusetts property in fiscal 2003 we relocated our operations from this facility to our woburn massachusetts facility we actively marketed the property located in haverhill massachusetts and in march 2004 entered into a contractual agreement for the sale of the property contingent upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals within the next two years 

during fiscal 2002 the company recorded a 660 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility in mexicali mexico the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in the market for test and assembly services for nonwireless products and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 

we experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at our mexicali facility for nonwireless products and projected decreasing revenues and new order volume management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the mexicali facility over a tenyear period the estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phaseout of services sold to conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook for the business partially offset by declining average selling prices the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately 100 million based on historical cost of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 24 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

during fiscal 2002 we recorded a 458 million charge for the writeoff of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of philsar in fiscal 2000 management determined that we would not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business accordingly this product line was discontinued and the employees associated with the product line were either severed or relocated to other operations as a result of the actions taken management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition were impaired 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2004 we consolidated cellular systems software design centers in an effort to improve our overall time to market for next generation multimedia systems development these actions aligned our structure with our current business environment we implemented reductions in force at three remote facilities and recorded restructuring charges of approximately 42 million for costs related to severance benefits for affected employees and lease obligations substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 

during fiscal 2003 we recorded 62 million in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation facility sales and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid and the remaining amounts are expected to be paid within one year 

during fiscal 2002 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the thencurrent business environment we recorded restructuring charges of approximately 30 million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

 the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily related to the conversion of our 45 million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 on april 22 2004 we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may 12 2004 on may 6 2004 the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 57 million shares of our common stock we paid interest in cash on the senior notes on the last business day of each march june september and december of each year interest paid on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature 

the company entered into borrowing arrangements at the time of the merger therefore the increase in interest expense for fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is primarily the result of fiscal 2002 representing approximately three months of interest incurred whereas fiscal 2003 includes interest for twelve months 

for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements  

other income expense net 

 nm  not meaningful 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances foreign exchange gainslosses and other nonoperating income and expense items 

provision for income taxes 

 as a result of our history of operating losses and the expectation of future operating results we determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with our foreign operations consequently no united states income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses as of september 30 2004 we have established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during the carry forward period 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets by 35 million this charge primarily originated from foreign currency translation errors after establishing the 231 million tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2002 for the impairment of our assembly and test machinery and equipment in mexicali mexico immediately following completion of the merger the cumulative effect of these errors is being reported in the provision for income taxes line of the statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as it did not have a material impact in prior periods the aggregate 35 million charge listed by fiscal year would be approximately 12 million 20 million and 03 million for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

in addition the provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

no provision has been made for united states state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 167 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practical to determine the united states federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

 we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill as a result we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and is reflected in our results of operations as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 the significant impairment charge to goodwill shortly after the merger resulted from a significant decline in the market price of our common stock the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis compares fair value to net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value we hired a thirdparty firm to perform the fair value calculation for the merger and subsequent sfas 142 valuation the fair value calculation used to determine the purchase price for the merger was performed in december 2001 the date at which the principal terms of the merger were agreed upon by both parties the calculation was based on the average market price of our common stock over a sevenday period this same methodology was used to determine our fair value at october 1 2002 for the required transitional impairment test upon the adoption of sfas no 142 between the time of the merger calculation in december 2001 and the sfas no 142 calculation in october 2002 the market price of our common stock declined as the wireless semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in demand amid concerns about terrorism deflation decreased consumer confidence reduced capital spending adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries since our fair value is directly linked to the market price of our common stock a significant decline in the market price of our common stock could and in this case did result in an impairment charge to goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 and determined that as of july 5 2004 our goodwill was not impaired 

liquidity and capital resources 

 fiscal 2004 

during fiscal 2004 we made progress in several key areas as we focused our efforts on both cash and inventory management we significantly reduced the number of days sales were outstanding in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to 658 from 875 for the same period in the previous fiscal year annualized inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 66 inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements during fiscal 2004 we also converted our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest incurred on these senior subordinated notes 

in fiscal 2004 we generated 919 million in cash from operating activities as we experienced a significant improvement in our operating results when compared to the previous fiscal year this improvement was primarily attributable to increased net revenues in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio more specifically we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence in addition we reduced research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 319 in fiscal 2004 from 391 for the previous fiscal year during fiscal 2004 we invested 600 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly integrated products and processes enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers’ demands we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to return to levels more comparable to fiscal 2003 

cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily represents an increase in borrowings under our 50 million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank national association for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements  

fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 

cash used in operating activities was 721 million for fiscal 2003 reflecting a net loss of 4514 million offset by noncash charges primarily asset impairments depreciation and amortization of 4892 million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately 1099 million including 400 million of mergerrelated expense payments as of september 30 2003 substantially all amounts accrued for mergerrelated expenses had been paid we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on october 1 2002 and recorded a 3971 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill operating results in fiscal 2003 improved when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily as the result of increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities cash used in operating activities was 991 million for fiscal 2002 operating cash flows for fiscal 2002 reflect a net loss of 2361 million offset by noncash charges depreciation and amortization asset impairments and an inprocess research and development charge of 2216 million and a net increase in working capital of approximately 846 million during 2002 we consolidated facilities reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives in addition increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal 2002 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 403 million the capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 represented our continued investment in production and test facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 also included 40 million of purchases of shortterm investments our shortterm investments are classified as heldtomaturity and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days and less than twelve months cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2002 consisted of capital expenditures of 294 million and dividends to conexant of 31 million offset by cash received of 671 million as a result of the merger and 354 million from the sale of shortterm investments acquired in the merger 

on august 11 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec with respect to the issuance of up to 250 million aggregate principal amount of securities including debt securities common or preferred shares warrants or any combination thereof this registration statement which the sec declared effective on august 28 2003 provides us with greater flexibility and access to capital on september 9 2003 we issued 92 million shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 included approximately 1022 million of net proceeds from this offering we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 also included the net impact of our private placement of 230 million of 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and related debt refinancing with conexant on november 13 2002 these subordinated notes can be converted into 1104911 shares of common stock per 1000 principal balance which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately 905 per share the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay 105 million of the 150 million debt to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and to prepay the 65 million principal amount outstanding as of november 13 2002 under a separate loan facility with conexant in connection with our prepayment of 105 million of the 150 million debt owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations the remaining 45 million principal balance was exchanged for new 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date of june 30 2005 on april 22 2004 we notified the holder of the senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on may 12 2004 on may 6 2004 the holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 57 million shares of our common stock in addition to the retirement of 170 million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant we also retained approximately 53 million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs in addition as of september 30 2003 we had borrowings outstanding of 417 million under our 50 million credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank national association for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements  cash provided by financing activities consisted of net transfers from conexant premerger of 504 million for fiscal 2002 cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2002 also consisted of 300 million of proceeds from borrowings against the revolving credit facility with conexant 

following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt purchase agreements and operating leases at september 30 2004 see notes 7 and 12 of the consolidated financial statements in thousands 

 under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to these supply agreements we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor through march 2005 our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately 129 million in fiscal 2005 

based on our results of operations for fiscal 2004 and current trends we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources if we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

other matters 

inflation did not have a significant impact upon our results of operations during the threeyear period ended september 30 2004 

certain business risks 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect our future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards from time to time changes in general economic conditions together with other factors cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these characteristics and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations furthermore downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints which may affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

we have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses 

our operating results for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were adversely affected by a global economic slowdown decreased consumer confidence reduced capital spending adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries these factors led to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions although we recently emerged from this period of economic weakness should economic conditions deteriorate for any reason it could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix and other impacts that would materially and adversely affect our operating results due to this economic uncertainty although we were profitable in fiscal 2004 we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such profitability or that we will not experience future operating losses 

additionally the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest have contributed to the economic uncertainty these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen or both our business financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and in particular the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration and increased miniaturization and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices modules and system solutions is highly complex and depends on numerous factors including 

 our ability to manufacture current products and to develop new products depends among other factors on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems “it systems” we upgrade and change our it systems from time to time and are currently implementing a system upgrade and there can be no assurance that such upgrade will be successful 

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface if we fail to rapidly and costeffectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed 

in addition prices of many of our products decline sometimes significantly over time we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 

the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics 

 these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the abovenoted factors 

the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

if oems and odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products are not sold directly to the enduser but are components or subsystems of other products as a result we rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom have rights to return unsold products we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products our business would be materially and adversely affected sales to motorola inc and to samsung electronics co represented approximately 14 and 12 respectively of net revenues for fiscal 2004 our future operating results will depend on the success of these customers and other customers and our success in selling products to them 

average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short 

in the semiconductor industry product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles therefore the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover and we are not able to compensate for those expenses our operating results would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory our operating results would be harmed 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on september 30 2004 we had total indebtedness of approximately 280 million which represented approximately 28 of our total capitalization 

as long as our 475 percent convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately 10925000 per year in interest payments if we issue other debt securities in the future our debt service obligations will increase if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 

we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations if any and from our existing cash and investments if necessary among other alternatives we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other longterm debt lines of credit and other financing 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

 despite our current debt levels we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

we may need to obtain sources of financing in the future we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing conditions existing in the us capital markets if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital as well as the terms of any such financing we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 

our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors present could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to replace such products 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may include electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity we also utilize subcontractors to package assemble and test our products there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

 although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to these supply agreements we are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor until march 2005 our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately 129 million for fiscal 2005 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs if we were to enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 

a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have design centers and suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

 additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

global economic weakness can have wideranging effects on markets that we serve particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators the wireless communications industry appears to be recovering from an industrywide recession we cannot predict whether a recovery will continue the rate of any such recovery or what effects negative events such as war may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties further an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term if it does not our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widelyused process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it at the present time we are in litigation with qualcomm incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other asserting violations of certain of our respective intellectual property rights although we believe their claims are without merit and we are vigorously defending against their claims and fully prosecuting our claims against them we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves from their claims or prosecuting our claims 

any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

 we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 

we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

 despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

our success depends in part on our ability to effect suitable investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire 

although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we intend to review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

 moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings for instance we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the amount of 3971 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

 in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states we cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future accordingly you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 

the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

 public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in addition fluctuations in our stock price and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis furthermore if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline possibly substantially over a short period of time accordingly you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 

changes in the accounting treatment of stock options could adversely affect our results of operations 

in march 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft to require companies to expense employee stock options in accordance with sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation for financial reporting purposes a final standard is expected to be issued by the end of 2004 and to be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 such stock option expensing would require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option valuation formula and amortize that value against our earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options we currently account for stockbased awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and have adopted the disclosureonly alternative of sfas 123 if we are required to expense employee stock options in the future this change in accounting treatment would materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings for an illustration of the effect of such a change on our recent results of operations see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risks such as changes in currency and interest rates that arise from normal business operation our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm debt and longterm debt our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital consequently we invest with only highcreditquality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of september 30 2004 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 

our shortterm debt primarily consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank na as of september 30 2004 we had borrowings of 500 million outstanding under this credit facility interest related to our shortterm debt is at libor plus 04 and was approximately 22 at september 30 2004 consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our shortterm debt 

we issued fixedrate debt which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interestrate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interestrate environment and the price of the underlying common stock for the year ended september 30 2004 our convertible debt on an ifconverted basis was not dilutive and as a result had no impact on our net income per share assuming dilution in future periods the debt may be converted or the ifconverted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced our longterm debt consists of 230 million of 475 percent unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our longterm debt 

based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september 30 2004 a nearterm change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the “evaluation date” based upon that evaluation the president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating to us or our consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in our periodic sec filings in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2004 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 11 executive compensation 

the following table presents information about total compensation during the last three completed fiscal years for the chief executive officer and the four next most highly compensated persons serving as executive officers during the year the named executives 

summary compensation table 

       the following tables provide information about stock options granted to and exercised by each of the named executives in fiscal year 2004 if any and the value of options held by each at october 1 2004 

option grants in last fiscal year individual grants 

 the options vest at a rate of 25 per year commencing one year after the date of grant provided the holder of the option remains employed by the company options may not be exercised beyond three months after the holder ceases to be employed by the company except in the event of termination by reason of death retirement or permanent disability in which event the option may be exercised for specific periods not exceeding one year following termination the assumed annual rates of stock price appreciation stated in the table are dictated by regulations of the securities and exchange commission and are compounded annually for the full term of the options actual outcomes may differ 

aggregated option exercises in last fiscal year and fiscal year end option values 

 the values of unexercised options in the foregoing table are based on the difference between the 999 closing price of skyworks common stock on october 1 2004 the end of the 2004 fiscal year on the nasdaq national market and the respective option exercise price 

longterm incentive awards 

there were no longterm incentive awards granted to any of the named executives in fiscal 2004 

executive compensation 

our executives are eligible for awards of nonqualified stock options incentive stock options and restricted stock awards under our applicable stock option plans these stock option plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors generally the exercise price at which an executive may purchase skyworks common stock pursuant to a stock option is the fair market value of skyworks common stock on the date of grant stock options are granted subject to restrictions on vesting with equal portions of the total grant generally vesting over a period of four years our stock options are subject to forfeiture after certain grace periods upon termination of employment retirement disability or death restricted stock awards involve the issuance of shares of common stock that may not be transferred or otherwise encumbered subject to certain exceptions for varying amounts of time and which will be forfeited in whole or in part if the executive terminates his or her employment with skyworks 

the named executives were also eligible to receive target incentive compensation under which a percentage of each executives total cash compensation is tied to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives during fiscal year 2004 the company did achieve the annual performance targets set by the board of directors and the incentive bonuses were paid to the named executives with respect to fiscal year 2004 and are reflected in the summary compensation table certain named executives also may participate in the companys executive compensation plan the executive compensation plan an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which participants may defer a portion of their compensation deferred amounts are held in a trust participants defer recognizing taxable income on the amount held for their benefit until the amounts are paid the company in its sole discretion may make additional contributions to the accounts of participants participants normally receive the deferred amounts upon retirement 

compensation of directors

 item 1 business summary skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is a leading wireless semiconductor company focused exclusively on radio frequency “rf” and complete cellular system solutions for mobile communications applications we offer frontend modules rf subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers 

from the power amplifier through the radio and to the baseband we have developed one of the industry’s broadest product portfolios including leadership switches and power amplifier modules additionally we offer a highly integrated direct conversion transceiver and have launched a comprehensive cellular system for next generation handsets 

with our extensive product portfolio and significant systemslevel expertise skyworks is the ideal partner for both toptier wireless manufacturers and new market entrants who demand simplified architectures faster development cycles and fewer overall suppliers 

skyworks was formed through the merger “merger” of the wireless business of conexant systems inc “conexant” and alpha industries inc “alpha” on june 25 2002 immediately following the merger the company purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations the “mexicali operations” shortly thereafter alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc we are headquartered in woburn massachusetts and have executive offices in irvine california we have design engineering manufacturing marketing sales and service facilities throughout north america europe and the asiapacific region our internet address is wwwskyworksinccom  we make available on our internet website free of charge our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k section 16 filings on forms 3 4 and 5 and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically file such material with the securities and exchange commission “sec” the information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k 

industry background we believe that the wireless industry is on the verge of another substantial growth cycle traditional voice services offered by wireless carriers are being rapidly supplemented or augmented by the emergence of the nextgeneration wireless technologies and wifibased 80211 wireless data applications all of these new technologies are geared to make highspeed wireless data available on handset pda notebook and other platforms in a variety of environments 

the cellular handset market has grown significantly over the past five years despite the broad technology slowdown in 2001 and 2002 according to market research firm emc handset sales have increased by approximately 300 from 1997 to 2002 with volume reaching 400 million units in 2002 exiting 2002 the worldwide penetration rate of wireless services was at 18 and is expected to climb to 28 by 2005 this increased penetration implies that approximately 650 million new subscribers will begin using wireless services over the next three years approaching the 18 billion worldwide subscriber mark in 2005 – roughly a fourth of the world’s population 

in parallel handset growth is being driven by replacement units purchased by existing subscribers as carriers introduce updated models smaller form factors added features and new applications in particular color displays and camera phones are expected to be two major growth drivers in the coming years according to the shosteck group sales of colordisplay phones will increase from roughly 85 million units in 2002 to over 350 million units by 2005 meanwhile handsets with builtin cameras are forecasted to increase from 20 million units in 2002 to almost 250 million units by 2005 these new wireless phones will also feature higher data rate services driven by 25g and 3g standards such as gprs cdma 2000 edge and wcdma according to emc the combination of new subscriber additions and higher replacement rates is expected to drive total handset sales from 400 million units in 2002 to approximately 544 million units in 2005 

in response to this rapidly growing market handset original equipment manufacturers or oems are significantly shortening product development cycles seeking simplified architectures and streamlining manufacturing processes traditional oems are shifting to lowcost suppliers around the world in turn original design manufacturers or odms and contract manufacturers who lack rf and systemslevel expertise are entering the highvolume mobile phone market to support oems as well as to develop handset platforms of their own odms and contract manufacturers seek to manage lowcost handset manufacturing and assembly freeing oems to focus on marketing and distribution aspects of their business established handset manufacturers and new market entrants alike are demanding complete semiconductor system solutions that include the rf system all baseband processing protocol stack and user interface software plus comprehensive reference designs and development platforms with these solutions traditional handset oems can accelerate timetomarket cycles with lower investments in engineering and system design these solutions also enable odms to enter the high volume handset market without requiring significant investments in rf and systemslevel expertise 

similarly cellular and personal communications services network operators are developing and deploying next generation services these service providers are incorporating packetswitching capability in their networks to deliver data communications and internet access to digital cellular and other wireless devices over the long term service providers are seeking to establish a global network that can be accessed by subscribers at any time anywhere in the world and that can provide subscribers with multimedia services to meet this goal oems that supply wireless infrastructure base stations to network operators are increasingly relying on mobile communications semiconductor suppliers that can provide highly integrated rf and mixed signal processing functionality 

additionally as service providers migrate cellular subscribers to data intensive next generation applications base stations that transmit and receive signals in the backbone of cellular and personal communications services systems will be under further capacity constraints to meet the related demand oems will be challenged to increase base station transceiver performance and functionality while reducing size power consumption and overall system costs 

we believe that these market trends create a potentially significant opportunity for a broadbased wireless semiconductor supplier with a comprehensive product portfolio supported by specialized wireless manufacturing process technologies and a full range of systemslevel expertise

customers during fiscal year 2003 samsung electronics co and motorola inc accounted for 15 and 11 respectively of the company’s total net revenues during fiscal year 2002 samsung electronics co and motorola inc accounted for 35 and 11 respectively of the company’s total net revenues as of september 30 2003 samsung electronics co accounted for approximately 18 of the company’s gross accounts receivable the foregoing percentages are based on sales representing the wireless business of conexant’s sales for the fiscal year 2002 up to the time of the merger and sales of the combined company for the postmerger period from june 26 2002 through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal 2003 

intellectual property and proprietary rights we own or are licensed under numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products our manufacturing operations and processes and other activities in addition we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services we believe that intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies devices algorithms and processes we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies devices algorithms or processes in addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain crosslicenses of intellectual property from others to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us we believe that our technological position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel 

competitive conditions we compete on the basis of time to market new product innovation overall product quality and performance price compliance with industry standards strategic relationships with customers and protection of our intellectual property certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers resellers suppliers or other third parties these relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 

research and development our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances recognizing the importance of such technological advances we maintain a high level of research and development activities we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands our design centers are strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide we are focusing our development efforts on new products design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies 

our research and development expenditures for fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 were 1518 million 1326 million and 1111 million respectively 

raw materials raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise consequently there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources we purchase materials and services against longterm agreements or on individual purchase orders we do not carry significant inventories and have a limited number of longterm supply contracts with our suppliers we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 

under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to these supply agreements we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately 39 million and 13 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005 respectively 

backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

environmental regulations federal state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations thus far compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition 

we believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources competitive position or financial condition we cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements 

cyclicality seasonality the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change product obsolescence price erosion evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand these and other factors together with changes in general economic conditions may cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business we have experienced periods of industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these factors may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in enduser consumer applications such as mobile handsets this generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in december sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the end of the calendar year 

geographic information net revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination net revenues by geographic area are as follows in thousands 

 our revenues by geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region for example if we sell a power amplifier module to a customer in south korea we record the sale within the south korea account although that customer in turn may integrate that module into a product sold to a service provider its customer in africa china europe the middle east the americas or within south korea 

longlived assets by geographic area are as follows in thousands 

 employees as of october 3 2003 the company employed approximately 3800 persons approximately 1100 employees in mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract motivate develop and retain highly skilled and dedicated employees 










 item 2 properties we own and lease manufacturing facilities and other real estate properties in the united states and a number of foreign countries we own and lease approximately 900000 square feet and 100000 square feet respectively of office and manufacturing space in addition we lease approximately 430000 square feet of sales office and design center space with approximately 22 of this space located in foreign countries we are headquartered in woburn massachusetts and have executive offices in irvine california the following table sets forth our principal facilities measuring 50000 square feet or more 

 we believe our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all the equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 

certain of our facilities including our california and mexico facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines we maintain no earthquake insurance with respect to these facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings from time to time various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been and may in the future be instituted or asserted against skyworks including those pertaining to patent infringement intellectual property environmental product liability safety and health employment and contractual matters in addition in connection with the merger skyworks has assumed responsibility for all then current and future litigation including environmental and intellectual property proceedings against conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of conexant’s wireless business the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to skyworks intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which if imposed against skyworks could materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of skyworks 

additionally the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology at the present time we are in discussions with qualcomm incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other in the united states district court for southern district of california asserting violations of certain of our respective intellectual property rights the purpose of these discussions is to arrive at a business resolution that avoids protracted litigation for both parties we believe their claims are without merit and if we are not successful resolving this matter outside of litigation we are prepared to vigorously defend against their claims and fully prosecute our claims against them 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended october 3 2003

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors including but not limited to risk factors risks and cautionary statements described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview skyworks solutions inc “skyworks” or the “company” is a leading wireless semiconductor company focused exclusively on radio frequency “rf” and complete cellular system solutions for mobile communications applications we offer frontend modules rf subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers 

on june 25 2002 pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of december 16 2001 as amended as of april 12 2002 by and among alpha industries inc “alpha” conexant systems inc “conexant” and washington sub inc “washington” a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant to which conexant spun off its wireless communications business including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park california but excluding certain assets and liabilities washington merged with and into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity the “merger” following the merger alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc 

immediately following completion of the merger the company purchased conexant’s semiconductor assembly module manufacturing and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain related operations “mexicali operations” for 150 million for financial accounting purposes the sale of the mexicali operations by conexant to skyworks solutions was treated as if conexant had contributed the mexicali operations to washington as part of the spinoff and the 150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to conexant for purposes of these financial statements the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as washingtonmexicali references to the “company” refer to washingtonmexicali for all periods prior to june 26 2002 and to the combined company following the merger 

the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington was treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree primarily because conexant shareholders owned a majority approximately 67 percent of the company upon completion of the merger under a reverse acquisition the purchase price of alpha was based upon the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha stock options the purchase price of alpha was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by washington as the acquiring company for accounting purposes based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date because the historical financial statements of the company after the merger do not include the historical financial results of alpha for periods prior to june 25 2002 the financial statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of the historical results that would have resulted if the merger had occurred at the beginning of a historical financial period 

we entered into agreements with conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by conexant and for the supply of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to conexant initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by conexant from washingtonmexicali we also entered into agreements with conexant and jazz semiconductor inc a newport beach california foundry joint venture between conexant and the carlyle group “jazz semiconductor” providing for the supply to us of siliconbased wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services by jazz semiconductor historically washingtonmexicali obtained a portion of its siliconbased semiconductors from the newport beach wafer fabrication facility that is now jazz semiconductor we also provide semiconductor assembly and test services to conexant at our mexicali facility 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand our operating results have been and our operating results may continue to be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors such as changes in demand for enduser equipment the timing of the receipt reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders the gain or loss of significant customers market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products our ability to develop introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis availability and cost of products from suppliers new product and technology introductions by competitors changes in the mix of products produced and sold intellectual property disputes the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions in the past average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future 

basis of presentation the financial statements prior to the merger were prepared using conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities and the historical operating results of washingtonmexicali during each respective period we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable however the financial information included herein and in our consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the combined assets liabilities operating results and cash flows of the company in the future and is not indicative of what they would have been had washingtonmexicali been a separate standalone entity and independent of conexant during the historical periods presented 

our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 fiscal 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on october 3 2003 and fiscal years 2002 and 2001 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on september 27 2002 and september 28 2001 respectively for convenience the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month accordingly references to september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 contained in this discussion refer to our actual fiscal yearend 

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts — we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

inventories — we assess the recoverability of inventories through an ongoing review of inventory levels relative to sales backlog and forecasts product marketing plans and product life cycles when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of six months we write down the value of those excess inventories we sell our products to communications equipment original equipment manufacturers “oems” that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle which includes providing technical support to the oem customer in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins consequently when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero the amount of the writedown is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero once established these writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected additional inventory writedowns may be required 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets — carrying values for longlived assets and definitivelived intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which was adopted on october 1 2002 impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition the estimate of cash flows is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 

carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which was adopted on october 1 2002 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 

deferred income taxes — we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations the future realization of certain tax deferred assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill the portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately 44 million we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly in fiscal 2002 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 23 million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets a valuation allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period 

revenue recognition — revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection andor a right of return on unsold products we reduce revenue to the extent of our estimate for distributor claims of price protection andor right of return on unsold product a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

results of operations general net revenues increased 1600 million or 35 in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily as the result of increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio and the exclusion of alpha’s revenues for periods prior to the merger since the merger we have also expanded our customer base and geographical market presence resulting in higher revenues in fiscal 2003 gross margin improved in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 reflecting increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities in fiscal 2003 we recorded special charges of 345 million principally related to the impairment of assets related to our infrastructure products and certain restructuring charges 

we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value as part of the first step we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fairvalue based test of goodwill this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in addition we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of july 1 2003 our goodwill was not further impaired 

years ended september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below 

 net revenues  we market and sell our semiconductor products and system solutions to leading oems of communication electronics products thirdparty original design manufacturers “odms” and contract manufacturers and indirectly through electronic components distributors samsung electronics co accounted for 15 35 and 44 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively motorola inc accounted for 11 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and represented less than 10 of net revenues for fiscal 2001 conexant accounted for less than 10 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and represented 17 of net revenues for fiscal 2001 nokia corporation accounted for less than 10 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and represented 12 of net revenues for fiscal 2001 

revenues derived from customers located in the americas region accounted for 25 17 and 27 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively revenues derived from customers located in the asiapacific region were 61 77 and 64 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively revenues derived from customers located in the europemiddle eastafrica region were 14 6 and 9 of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our revenues by geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region for example if we sell a power amplifier module to a customer in south korea we record the sale within the south korea account although that customer in turn may integrate that module into a product sold to a service provider its customer in africa china europe the middle east the americas or within south korea 

the foregoing percentages are based on sales representing washingtonmexicali sales for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 up to the time of the merger and sales of the combined company for the postmerger period from june 26 2002 through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal 2003 

net revenues increased in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily reflecting increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio and the exclusion of alpha’s revenues for periods prior to the merger more specifically gsm direct conversion transceivers and complete cellular systems as well as cdma rf subsystems exhibited strong yearoveryear growth additionally we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence 

these increases in net revenues in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices of our frontend module products and an industrywide component and handset inventory correction in addition lower cdma handset subsidies in korea also adversely affected net revenues in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 in certain global markets wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers ultimately decreasing the cost of the handset to the customer 

net revenues increased 758 in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001 principally reflecting increased sales of gsm products including power amplifier modules and complete cellular systems we also experienced increased demand for our power amplifier modules for cdma and tdma applications from a number of our key customers 

gross margin  gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing royalty and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold cost of goods sold for the periods prior to the merger also includes allocations from conexant of manufacturing cost variances process engineering and other manufacturing costs which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as incurred 

the improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflects increased revenues improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the writedown of our mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 although recent revenue growth has increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities these facilities continue to operate below optimal capacity and underutilization continues to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross margin 

gross margin in fiscal 2003 was also favorably affected by 48 million when we reevaluated our obligation under a wafer fabrication supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor and reduced our liability and cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 pursuant to the terms of wafer supply agreements with conexant and jazz semiconductor we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor as of september 30 2003 we expect to meet all of these purchase obligations our costs will be affected by the extent of our use of outside foundries and the pricing we are able to obtain during periods of high industry demand for wafer fabrication capacity we may have to pay higher prices to secure wafer fabrication capacity 

the improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 reflects increased revenues improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the writedown of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 and the mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of 2002 the effect of the writedown of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets and the mexicali facility assets on fiscal 2002 gross margin was approximately 105 million and 55 million respectively gross margin for fiscal 2002 was adversely impacted by additional warranty costs of 140 million the additional warranty costs were the result of an agreement with a major customer for the reimbursement of costs the customer incurred in connection with the failure of a product when used in a certain adverse environment although we developed and sold the product to the customer pursuant to mutually agreedupon specifications the product experienced unusual failures when used in an environment in which the product had not been previously tested the product has since been modified and no significant additional costs are expected to be incurred in connection with this issue 

in addition we originally estimated our obligation under our wafer supply agreement with conexant and jazz semiconductor inc would result in excess costs of approximately 129 million when recorded as a liability and charged to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we reevaluated this obligation and reduced our liability and cost of sales by approximately 81 million in the quarter 

gross margin for the year ended september 30 2002 benefited by approximately 125 million as a result of the sale of inventories having a historical cost of 125 million that were written down to a zero cost basis during fiscal year 2001 such sales resulted from sharply increased demand beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 that was not anticipated at the time of the writedowns gross margin for fiscal 2001 was adversely affected by inventory writedowns of approximately 587 million partially offset by approximately 45 million of subsequent sales of inventories written down to a zero cost basis the inventories that were written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2001 were either sold or scrapped during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 we sold 27 million 125 million and 45 million respectively and scrapped 27 million 18 million and 345 million respectively as of september 30 2003 we no longer held inventories which were written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2001 

the inventory writedowns recorded in fiscal 2001 resulted from the sharply reduced endcustomer demand we experienced primarily associated with our rf components as a result of the rapidly changing demand environment for digital cellular handsets during that period as a result of these market conditions we experienced a significant number of order cancellations and a decline in the volume of new orders beginning in the fiscal 2001 first quarter and becoming more pronounced in the second quarter 

research and development  research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs costs for preproduction evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs research and development expenses for the periods prior to the merger also include allocated costs for shared research and development services provided by conexant principally in the areas of advanced semiconductor process development design automation and advanced package development for the benefit of several of conexant’s businesses 

the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 represents our commitment to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands we have expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma2000 gsm general packet radio services or gprs and thirdgeneration or 3g wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is also related to our research and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses in 2002 are representative of only washingtonmexicali prior to june 25 2002 

the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the opening of a new design center in le mans france and higher headcount and personnelrelated costs subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma2000 gsm gprs and 3g wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets 

selling general and administrative  selling general and administrative expenses include personnel costs legal accounting treasury human resources information systems customer service etc sales representative commissions advertising and other marketing costs selling general and administrative expenses also include allocated general and administrative expenses from conexant for the periods prior to the merger for a variety of these shared functions 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily related to our selling general and administrative expenses representing those of the combined company after the merger whereas those expenses for the same period in 2002 are representative of only washingtonmexicali prior to june 25 2002 

the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects lower headcount and personnelrelated costs resulting from the expense reduction and restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2001 and lower provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable 

amortization of intangible assets  in 2002 we recorded 364 million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology customer relationships and a trademark these assets are principally being amortized on a straightline basis over a 10year period amortization expense for fiscal 2003 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets amortization expense for fiscal 2002 and 2001 primarily represents amortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with washingtonmexicali’s acquisition of philsar semiconductor inc “philsar” in fiscal 2000 philsar was a developer of rf semiconductor solutions for personal wireless connectivity including emerging standards such as bluetooth and rf components for thirdgeneration digital cellular handsets we wrote off all goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the philsar bluetooth business in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the lower amortization expense in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 primarily resulted from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on october 1 2002 had the company ceased amortizing goodwill on october 1 2000 amortization expense would have been 107 million and 139 million less in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively 

we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value as part of the first step we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fairvalue based test of goodwill this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in addition we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of july 1 2003 our goodwill was not further impaired 

purchased inprocess research and development  in connection with the merger in fiscal 2002 655 million was allocated to purchased inprocess research and development “iprd” and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition as a charge not deductible for tax purposes because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed the charges represent the estimated fair values of the portion of iprd projects that had been completed by alpha at the time of the merger 

prior to the merger alpha was in the process of developing new technologies in its semiconductor and ceramics segments the objective of the iprd effort was to develop new semiconductor processes ceramic materials and related products to satisfy customer requirements in the wireless and broadband markets 

the semiconductor segment was involved in several projects that have been aggregated into the following categories based on the respective technologies power amplifier   power amplifiers are designed and manufactured for use in different types of wireless handsets the main performance attributes of these amplifiers are efficiency power output operating voltage and distortion current research and development is focused on expanding the offering to all types of wireless standards improving performance by process and circuit improvements and offering a higher level of integration control products   control products consist of switches and switch filters that are used in wireless applications for signal routing most applications are in the handset market enabling multimode multiband handsets current research and development is focused on performance improvement and cost reduction by reducing chip size and increasing functionality broadband   the products in this grouping consist of radio frequency rf and millimeter wave semiconductors and components designed and manufactured specifically to address the needs of highspeed wireline and wireless network access current and longterm research and development is focused on performance enhancement of speed and bandwidth as well as cost reduction and integration silicon diode   these products use silicon processes to fabricate diodes for use in a variety of rf and wireless applications current research and development is focused on reducing the size of the device improving performance and reducing cost ceramics   the ceramics segment was involved in projects that relate to the design and manufacture of ceramicbased components such as resonators and filters for the wireless infrastructure market current research and development is focused on performance enhancements through improved formulations and electronic designs 

the material risks associated with the successful completion of the inprocess technology were associated with our ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips masks and manufacturing processes required we expected to benefit from the inprocess projects as the individual products that contained the inprocess technology were put into production and sold to endusers the release dates for each of the products within the product families were varied the fair value of the iprd was determined using the income approach under the income approach the fair value reflected the present value of the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating the iprd if successful the projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair value the discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage of completion and other risks inherent in each project the weighted average discount rate used in the valuation of iprd was 30 percent as of september 30 2003 the company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects the completed iprd projects commenced generating cash flows in fiscal 2003 due to the nature of these projects and the related technolgy the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified 

special charges  asset impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 260 million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain infrastructure products manufactured in our woburn massachusetts and adamstown maryland facilities the woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology our adamstown maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components we experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook we projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets machinery equipment and intangible assets may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a fiveyear period since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 16 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets the anticipated pretax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be 174 million over the next five years fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 and 86 million over the subsequent fifteen years fiscal 2009 through 2023 

in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge for the impairment of our haverhill massachusetts property that is currently being held for sale in fiscal 2003 we relocated our operations from this facility to our woburn massachusetts facility we are actively marketing the property located in haverhill massachusetts 

during fiscal 2002 the company recorded a 660 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility in mexicali mexico the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in the market for test and assembly services for nonwireless products and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 

we experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at our mexicali facility for nonwireless products and projected decreasing revenues and new order volume management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the mexicali facility over a tenyear period the estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phaseout of services sold to conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook for the business partially offset by declining average selling prices the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately 100 million based on historical cost of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 24 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

during fiscal 2002 we recorded a 458 million charge for the writeoff of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of philsar in fiscal 2000 management determined that we would not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business accordingly this product line was discontinued and the employees associated with the product line were either severed or relocated to other operations as a result of the actions taken management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition were impaired 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded an 862 million charge for the impairment of our manufacturing facility and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at our newbury park california facility this impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for wireless communications products and the related impact on our thencurrent and projected business outlook through the third quarter of fiscal 2001 we experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at the newbury park wafer fabrication facility and decreasing revenues backlog and new order volume management believed these factors together with its decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures for advanced process technologies and capacity beyond the thencurrent levels indicated that the value of the newbury park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed in performing the analysis for recoverability management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the newbury park facility over a tenyear period the estimated future cash flows were based on modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook for the industry partially offset by declining average selling prices the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s decision to focus on existing products based on the current technology since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately 106 million based on historical cost of the related assets it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 30 which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected cash flows we believe the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets the writedown established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 

restructuring charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 we recorded 33 million and 29 million respectively in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation facility sales and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 

during fiscal 2002 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the thencurrent business environment we recorded restructuring charges of approximately 30 million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid 

during fiscal 2001 washingtonmexicali reduced its workforce by approximately 250 employees including approximately 230 employees in manufacturing operations restructuring charges of 27 million were recorded for such actions and were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for the affected employees we have paid all amounts accrued for these actions 

activity and liability balances related to the fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 restructuring actions are as follows in thousands 

 in addition we assumed approximately 78 million of restructuring reserves from alpha in connection with the merger during the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 and 2002 payments related to the restructuring reserves assumed from alpha were 47 million and 11 million respectively on september 30 2003 this balance was 20 and primarily relates to payments on a lease that expires in 2008 

interest expense  our debt at september 30 2003 consists of 230 million of convertible subordinated junior notes 45 million of convertible senior subordinated notes 417 million of borrowings under our receivable purchase agreement and a loan that matures in december 2003 

our longterm debt primarily consists of 230 million of convertible subordinated junior notes at a fixed interest rate of 475 percent due 2007 these junior notes can be converted into 1104911 shares of common stock per 1000 principal balance which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately 905 per share we may redeem the junior notes at any time after november 20 2005 the redemption price of the junior notes during the period between november 20 2005 through november 14 2006 will be 1011875 per 1000 principal amount of notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date and the redemption price of the notes beginning on november 15 2006 and thereafter will be 1000 per 1000 principal amount of notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date holders may require that we repurchase the junior notes upon a change in control of the company we pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year 

in addition our longterm debt includes 45 million of convertible senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of 15 percent due june 30 2005 which were issued as part of our debt refinancing with conexant completed on november 13 2002 these senior notes can be converted into our common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price which is subject to adjustment based on among other things the market price of our common stock based on this adjustable conversion price we expect that the maximum number of shares that could be issued under the senior notes is approximately 71 million shares subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences if the holders of these senior notes converted the notes at a price that is less than the original conversion price 787 as the result of a decrease in the market price of our stock we would be required to record a charge to interest expense in the period of conversion at maturity including upon certain acceleration events we will pay the principal amount of the senior notes by issuing a number of shares of common stock equal to the principal amount of the senior notes then due and payable divided by the applicable conversion price in effect on such date together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares we may redeem the senior notes at any time after may 12 2004 at 1030 per 1000 principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest the holders may require that we repurchase the senior notes upon a change in control of the company we pay interest in cash on the senior notes on the last business day of each march june september and december of each year interest on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature 

we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to skyworks usa inc “skyworks usa” a whollyowned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes concurrently skyworks usa entered into an agreement with wachovia bank national association providing for a 50 million credit facility “facility agreement” secured by the purchased accounts receivable our shortterm debt consists primarily of funds borrowed under the facility agreement as a part of the consolidation any interest incurred by skyworks usa related to monies it borrows under the facility agreement is recorded as interest expense in our results of operations interest related to the facility agreement is libor plus 04 and was approximately 15 at september 30 2003 we perform collections and administrative functions on behalf of skyworks usa as of september 30 2003 skyworks usa had borrowed 417 million under this agreement 

in addition our shortterm debt includes the remaining portion of a tenyear 960000 loan from the state of maryland under the community development block grant program due december 2003 at an interest rate of 5 percent 

other income expense net  nm  not meaningful 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances foreign exchange gainslosses and other nonoperating income and expense items 

provision for income taxes  as a result of our history of operating losses and the expectation of future operating results we determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with our foreign operations consequently no united states income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses as of september 30 2003 we have established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during the carry forward period 

the provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized in 2002 the provision for foreign income taxes was offset by a tax benefit of approximately 23 million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 

no provision has been made for united states state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately 38 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested it is not practical to determine the united states federal income tax liability if any which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets on october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value as part of the first step we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fairvalue based test of goodwill this reporting unit is consistent with our single operating segment which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in addition we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of july 1 2003 our goodwill was not further impaired 

liquidity and capital resources  cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 totaled 1615 million 534 million and 20 million respectively working capital at september 30 2003 was approximately 2493 million compared to 798 million at september 30 2002 and 605 million at september 30 2001 inventory turns were approximately 65 for fiscal 2003 

cash used in operating activities was 721 million for fiscal 2003 reflecting a net loss of 4514 million offset by noncash charges primarily asset impairments depreciation and amortization of 4892 million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately 1099 million including 400 million of mergerrelated expense payments as of september 30 2003 substantially all amounts accrued for mergerrelated expenses have been paid we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on october 1 2002 and recorded a 3971 million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill operating results in fiscal 2003 improved when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily as the result of increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 403 million the capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 represent our continued investment in production and test facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 also included 40 million of purchases of shortterm investments our shortterm investments are classified as heldtomaturity and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days and less than twelve months 

on august 11 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec with respect to the issuance of up to 250 million aggregate principal amount of securities including debt securities common or preferred shares warrants or any combination thereof this registration statement which the sec declared effective on august 28 2003 provides us with greater flexibility and access to capital on september 9 2003 we issued 92 million shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 included approximately 1022 million of net proceeds from this offering we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003 also included the net impact of our private placement of 230 million of 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and related debt refinancing with conexant on november 13 2002 these subordinated notes can be converted into 1104911 shares of common stock per 1000 principal balance which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately 905 per share the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay 105 million of the 150 million debt to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and prepay the 65 million principal amount outstanding as of november 13 2002 under a separate loan facility with conexant in connection with our prepayment of 105 million of the 150 million debt owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations the remaining 45 million principal balance was exchanged for new 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date of june 30 2005 these senior subordinated notes can be converted into our common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price which is subject to adjustment based on among other things the market price of our common stock based on this adjustable conversion price we expect that the maximum number of shares that could be issued under the senior subordinated notes is approximately 71 million shares subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences in addition to the retirement of 170 million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant we also retained approximately 53 million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs in addition as of september 30 2003 skyworks usa had borrowed 417 million under our 50 million facility agreement secured by the purchased accounts receivable with wachovia bank national association 

cash used in operating activities was 991 million and 894 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively operating cash flows for fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflect net losses of 2361 million and 3189 million respectively offset by noncash charges depreciation and amortization asset impairments and an inprocess research and development charge of 2216 million and 2208 million respectively and a net increase in working capital of approximately 846 million and a net decrease of 87 million respectively during 2002 we consolidated facilities reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives in addition increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001 

cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2002 consisted of capital expenditures of 294 million and dividends to conexant of 31 million offset by cash received of 671 million as a result of the merger and 354 million from the sale of shortterm investments acquired in the merger cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2001 consisted of capital expenditures of 511 million the capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 reflect a significant reduction from annual capital expenditures in fiscal 2001 a key component of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2002 

cash provided by financing activities consisted of net transfers from conexant premerger of 504 million and 1383 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2002 also consisted of 300 million of proceeds from borrowings against the revolving credit facility with conexant historically conexant managed cash on a centralized basis cash receipts associated with washingtonmexicali’s business were generally collected by conexant and conexant generally made disbursements on behalf of washingtonmexicali 

following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt purchase agreements and operating leases at september 30 2003 see notes 8 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements in thousands 

 under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to these supply agreements we are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately 39 million and 13 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005 respectively 

based on our fiscal 2003 results of operations and current trends and after giving effect to the net proceeds we received in our private placement of 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 our debt refinancing with conexant our common stock public offering and our facility agreement we expect our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditures debt obligations purchase obligations working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 

other matters inflation did not have a significant impact upon our results of operations during the threeyear period ended september 30 2003 

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangibles” sfas no 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized into results of operations but instead are evaluated at least annually for impairment and written down when the recorded value exceeds the estimated fair value we adopted sfas no 142 on october 1 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value in determining fair value sfas no 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value as part of the first step we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fairvalue based test of goodwill this reporting unit is consistent with its single operating segment which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” we completed step one and determined that our goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess we completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was 3971 million greater than its implied fair value this transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in addition we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of july 1 2003 our goodwill was not further impaired 

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made we adopted the provisions or sfas no 143 on october 1 2002 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of we adopted sfas no 144 on october 1 2002 and recorded asset impairment charges in accordance with its guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 these charges primarily related to certain infrastructure products manufactured at our woburn massachusetts and adamstown maryland facilities 

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statement no‘s 4 44 and 64 amendment of sfas no 13 and technical corrections” effective for fiscal years beginning may 15 2002 or later it rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt” sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” and sfas no 44 “accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers” this statement also amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to saleleaseback transactions this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we adopted sfas no 145 on october 1 2002 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 we adopted sfas no 146 on october 1 2002 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee fin 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued the recognition provisions of fin 45 are effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december 31 2002 we adopted fin 45 on january 1 2003 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

certain business risks we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

from time to time changes in general economic conditions together with other factors cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry periods of industry downturn as we experienced beginning in calendar year 2001 have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices these characteristics and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations 

during the late 1990‘s and extending into 2000 the wireless communications semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid expansion of wireless communication services worldwide and increased demand for digital cellular handsets however beginning in calendar year 2001 we were adversely impacted by a global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our products and system solutions particularly cellular handsets the impact of weakened endcustomer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of inventories among our original equipment manufacturer or oem subcontractor and distributor customers should the reduced endcustomer demand continue this could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and other impacts that would continue to materially and adversely affect our operating results 

because of the cyclical nature of the wireless communications semiconductor industry we cannot assure you of the timing duration or magnitude of any recovery in our industry or that a recovery will occur we cannot assure you that the wireless communications semiconductor industry will not experience renewed and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns in the future or that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 

we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and may experience future losses 

our operating results have been adversely affected by a global economic slowdown concerns about inflation decreased consumer confidence reduced capital spending adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries these factors have lead to an to a slowdown in customer orders an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions as a result we continued to incur operating losses during fiscal 2003 and may experience operating losses in the future should the reduced endcustomer demand continue for any reason this could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could continue to materially and adversely affect our operating results in the near term due to these economic factors we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will become profitable or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability if achieved 

  additionally the conflict in iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest have augmented the economic slowdown these continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions continue or worsen our business financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

the wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue this competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share furthermore additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include among others 

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of 

 as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can 

current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors increased competition could result in pricing pressures decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 

the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product evolution price erosion evolving technical standards short product life cycles increasing demand for higher levels of integration and increased miniaturization and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand in particular the markets into which we sell demand cuttingedge technologies and new and innovative products our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis the development and commercialization of semiconductor devices modules and system solutions is highly complex successful product development and introduction depends on numerous factors including 

 we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties to which our products interface 

in addition prices of products may decline sometimes significantly over time we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 

the markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change 

the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics 

 these changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the abovenoted factors 

the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design development manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success 

as the source of our technological and product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset our success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry and we therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design development manufacture and sale of our products we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 

if oems and odms of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 

our products will not be sold directly to the enduser but will be components or subsystems of other products as a result we will rely on oems and odms of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment without these “design wins” we would have difficulty selling our products if a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer also achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products for example if its own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales 

lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products 

after our product is has been developed tested and manufactured our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment incorporates the products this lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products furthermore we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales will typically be made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our customers our customers may cancel orders before shipment additionally we will sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom will have rights to return unsold products we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could result in inventory writedowns and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 

a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products our business would be materially and adversely affected sales to samsung electronics co and to motorola inc represented approximately 15 and 11 respectively of net revenues for fiscal 2003 our future operating results will depend on the success of these customers and other customers and our success in selling products to them 

average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short  

in the semiconductor industry product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles therefore the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory if we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover and we are not able to compensate for those expenses our operating results would be materially and adversely affected in addition if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory our operating results would be harmed 

our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

on september 30 2003 after giving effect to unused availability under our receivable financing credit facility with wachovia bank national association we would have had total indebtedness of approximately 325 million which would have represented approximately 34 of our total capitalization 

as long as our 475 percent convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding we will have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately 10925000 per year in interest payments in addition we will have debt service obligations on our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes due june 30 2005 originally issued to conexant of approximately 6750000 per year if we issue other debt securities in the future our debt service obligations will increase if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 

we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations if any and from our existing cash and investments if necessary among other alternatives we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other longterm debt lines of credit and other financing 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences including 

 despite our current debt levels we are able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks described above 

we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 

we will need to obtain sources of financing in the future after giving effect to the net proceeds of our 102 million offering on or about september 12 2003 our 230 million private placement of 475 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 our 45 million debt refinancing with conexant and our receivables financing credit facility with wachovia bank national association we believe that our existing sources of liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development capital expenditure working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months 

however we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future conditions existing in the us capital markets when we seek financing as well as the then current condition of the company will affect our ability to raise capital as well as the terms of any financing we may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption including for causes beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities contamination of the clean room environment errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer defects in equipment or materials human error or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields these factors present could have a material adverse affect on our business in addition we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped which may require us to replace such products 

additionally our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may include electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding war acts of terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor in the event of such delays we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the newbury park california or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 

minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability the difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 

we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture assembly and test of our products 

we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities called foundries to provide siliconbased products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity we also utilize subcontractors to package assemble and test our products there are significant risks associated with reliance on thirdparty foundries including 

 although we have longterm supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity the thirdparty foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers if we choose to use a new foundry it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry the foundries may experience financial difficulties be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 

our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world while we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials we are currently dependent on a solesource supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis in connection with our ongoing review we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers we may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs if we were to enter into an additional sole supplier arrangement for any of our raw materials or components the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated 

under supply agreements entered into with conexant and jazz semiconductor inc we receive wafer fabrication wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor pursuant to these supply agreements we are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from jazz semiconductor our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be approximately 39 million and 13 million respectively in fiscal 2004 and 2005 

remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration 

  in order to remain competitive we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products in the past we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes which resulted in suboptimal manufacturing yields delays in product deliveries and increased expenses we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future in some instances we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality as well as customer and third party intellectual property into our products however we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all 

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally historically a substantial majority of the company’s net revenues from customers other than conexant were derived from customers located outside the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and europe in addition we have design centers and suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asiapacific region finally we have our own packaging assembly and test facility in mexicali mexico our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are not limited to risks regarding 

 additionally we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors which could impact the demand for our products limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in south korea japan china and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues 

our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 

  our revenues earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

these factors include among others 

   the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock  

global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

global economic weakness can have wideranging effects on markets that we serve particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators the wireless communications industry appears to be recovering from an industrywide recession we cannot predict whether a recovery will continue the rate of any such recovery or what effects negative events such as war may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties further an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term if it does not our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives 

  among our product portfolio we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits the cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes therefore to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their siliconbased counterparts if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential our operating results may be materially and adversely affected we expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts silicon semiconductor technologies are widelyused process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 

  the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it at the present time we are in discussions with qualcomm incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other asserting violations of certain of our respective intellectual property rights the purpose of these discussions is to arrive at a business resolution that avoids protracted litigation for both parties we believe their claims are without merit and if we are not successful resolving this matter outside of litigation we are prepared to vigorously defend against their claims and fully prosecute our claims against them 

  any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to 

   we cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items 

many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties 

  we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a competitive posture if licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete and we could lose market share in such instances we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may harm our ability to compete 

  we rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies information data devices algorithms and processes in addition we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that 

   despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar technology independently or design around our patents if any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 

our success depends in part on our ability to effect suitable investments alliances and acquisitions and to integrate companies we acquire and on our continued success integrating the wireless business of conexant with the company 

  although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an ongoing basis we intend to review investment alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment alliance or acquisition transactions in the future moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in 

 moreover integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated fair value with a charge against earnings for instance we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the amount of 3971 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the merger 

we may be responsible for payment of a substantial amount of us federal income and other taxes upon certain events 

  in connection with conexant’s spinoff of its wireless business prior to the merger conexant sought and received a ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that certain transactions related to and including the spinoff qualified as a reorganization and as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes while the tax ruling generally is binding on the internal revenue service the continuing validity of the ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions in connection with the merger we entered into a tax allocation agreement with conexant that generally provides among other things that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on various persons including conexant as a result of either 

 if such failure is attributable to certain actions or transactions by or in respect of skyworks including our subsidiaries or our stockholders such as the acquisition of stock of skyworks by a third party at a time and in a manner that would cause such failure in addition the tax allocation agreement provides that we will be responsible for various other tax obligations and for compliance with various representations statements and conditions made in the course of obtaining the tax ruling referenced above and in connection with the tax allocation agreement our obligations under the tax allocation agreement have been limited by a letter agreement dated november 6 2002 entered into in connection with our debt refinancing with conexant nevertheless if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with the requirements imposed as a result of the spinoff and related transactions and our responsibilities under the tax allocation agreement we might inadvertently trigger an obligation to indemnify certain persons including conexant pursuant to the tax allocation agreement or other obligations under such agreement in addition our indemnity obligations could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire skyworks 

  if we were required to pay any of the taxes described above the payment could be very substantial and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  in addition it is expected that the interest payments we are required to make on our 45 million principal amount of 15 convertible subordinated notes due june 30 2005 originally issued to conexant will not be deductible for tax purposes our inability to offset our interest expense from these notes against other income may increase our tax liability currently and in future years 

  further the terms of these senior subordinated notes require us to pay the principal due at the maturity date or upon certain acceleration events in a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal due at such time divided by the applicable conversion price on such date if the fair market value of our common stock on such date is less than the applicable conversion price we may recognize cancellation of indebtedness income for tax purposes equal to the excess of the principal amount of these notes due at such time over the fair market value of the common stock issued by us to satisfy our obligations under these notes 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 

  we have certain antitakeover measures that may affect our common stock our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions such as 

 in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws section 203 of the delaware general 

corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations which could adversely impact our business 

  we have used and will continue to use a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states while we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations as a result of such regulations we cannot assure you that current or future regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future accordingly you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 

  the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors including 

   public stock markets have experienced and are currently experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  in addition fluctuations in our stock price and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks such as changes in currency and interest rates that arise from normal business operation our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents shortterm debt and longterm debt our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital consequently we invest with only highcreditquality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of september 30 2003 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value our shortterm debt primarily consists of borrowings under our receivables purchase agreement as of september 30 2003 we had borrowed 417 million under this agreement in addition our shortterm debt includes the remaining portion of a tenyear 960000 loan from the state of maryland under the community development block grant program due december 2003 at an interest rate of 5 percent interest related to our shortterm debt is at a fixed rate consequently we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our shortterm debt 

we issued fixedrate debt which is convertible into our common stock at a predetermined or market related conversion price convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interestrate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interestrate environment and the price of the underlying common stock for the year ended september 30 2003 our convertible debt on an ifconverted basis was not dilutive and as a result had no impact on our net income per share assuming dilution in future periods the debt may be converted or the ifconverted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced our longterm debt consists of 230 million of 475 percent unsecured convertible subordinated notes due november 2007 and 45 million of 15 percent unsecured convertible senior subordinated notes due june 2005 we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our longterm debt 

based on our overall evaluation of our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at september 30 2003 a nearterm change in market rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure alpha’s independent accountant was kpmg llp “kpmg” and washingtonmexicali’s independent accountant was deloitte  touche llp “deloitte  touche” kpmg has continued to serve as the company’s independent accountant after consummation of the merger because the merger is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition the financial statements of washingtonmexicali constitute the financial statements of the company as of the consummation of the merger therefore upon the consummation of the merger on june 25 2002 there was a change in the independent accountant for the company’s financial statements from deloitte  touche to kpmg and accordingly deloitte  touche was dismissed as the company’s independent accountant 

the report of deloitte  touche on washingtonmexicali’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion nor was such report qualified or modified as to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles the decision to change accountants was approved by the board of directors 

during washingtonmexicali’s fiscal year ended september 30 2001 and through the subsequent interim period to june 25 2002 washingtonmexicali did not have any disagreement with deloitte  touche on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure that if not resolved to deloitte  touche’s satisfaction would have caused deloitte  touche to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report during that time there were no “reportable events” as set forth in item 304a1vad of regulation sk “regulation sk” adopted by the sec 

kpmg or its predecessors has been alpha’s independent accountant since 1975 and alpha has regularly consulted kpmg or its predecessors since that time washingtonmexicali as the continuing reporting entity for accounting purposes did not consult kpmg during washingtonmexicali’s fiscal year ended september 30 2001 and through the interim period to june 25 2002 regarding any of the matters specified in item 304a2 of regulation sk 




 item 9a controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the “evaluation date” based upon that evaluation the president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating to us or our consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in our periodic sec filings in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

there were no significant changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2003 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 10 directors and executive officers of the registrant     


 item 11 executive compensation the information in the sections entitled “compensation of executive officers” and “compensation of directors ” appearing in the proxy statement is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 12 security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters except for the information concerning equity compensation plans the information in the section entitled “securities ownership of certain beneficial owners and management” appearing in the proxy statement is incorporated herein by reference 

equity compensation plan information the company maintains nine equity compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance to our employees andor directors — the 1986 longterm incentive plan — the 1994 nonqualified stock option plan — the 1996 longterm incentive plan — the 1997 nonqualified stock option plan — the 1999 employee longterm incentive plan — the directors’ 2001 stock option plan — the nonqualified employee stock purchase plan — the 2002 employee stock purchase plan and — the washington sub inc 2002 stock option plan 

except for the 1999 employee longterm incentive plan the washington sub inc 2002 stock option plan and the nonqualified employee stock purchase plan each of the foregoing equity compensation plans was approved by our stockholders 

the following table presents information about these plans as of september 30 2003 

   1999 employee longterm incentive plan the purposes of the company’s 1999 employee longterm incentive plan the “1999 employee plan” are i to provide longterm incentives and rewards to those employees of the company and its subsidiaries other than officers and nonemployee directors who are in a position to contribute to the longterm success and growth of the company and its subsidiaries ii to assist the company in retaining and attracting employees with requisite experience and ability and iii to associate more closely the interests of such employees with those of the company’s stockholders the 1999 employee plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of the company’s common stock the term of these options may not exceed ten years the 1999 employee plan contains provisions which permit restrictions on vesting or transferability as well as continued exercisability upon a participant’s termination of employment with the company of options granted thereunder the 1999 employee plan provides for full acceleration of the vesting of options granted thereunder upon a “change in control” of the company as defined in the 1999 employee plan the board of directors generally may amend suspend or terminate the 1999 employee plan in whole or in part at any time provided that any amendment which affects outstanding options be consented to by the holder of the options 

washington sub inc 2002 stock option plan the washington sub inc 2002 stock option plan the “washington sub plan” became effective on june 25 2002 in connection with the merger at the time of the spinoff of conexant’s wireless business outstanding conexant options granted pursuant to certain conexant stock incentive plans were converted so that following the spinoff and merger each holder of those certain conexant options held i options to purchase shares of conexant common stock and ii options to purchase shares of skyworks common stock the purpose of the washington sub plan is to provide a means for the company to perform its obligations with respect to these converted stock options the only participants in the washington sub plan are those persons who at the time of the merger held outstanding options granted pursuant to certain conexant stock option plans no further options to purchase shares of skyworks common stock will be granted under the washington sub plan the washington sub plan contains a number of subplans which contain terms and conditions that are applicable to certain portions of the options subject to the washington sub plan depending upon the conexant stock option plan from which the skyworks options granted under the washington sub plan were derived the outstanding options under the washington sub plan generally have the same terms and conditions as the original conexant options from which they are derived most of the subplans of the washington sub plan contain provisions related to the effect of a participant’s termination of employment with the company if any andor with conexant on options granted pursuant to such subplan several of the subplans under the washington sub plan contain specific provisions related to a change in control of the company 

nonqualified espp the company also maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan to provide employees of the company and participating subsidiaries with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the company through the purchase by means of payroll deductions of shares of the company’s common stock at a discount from the market price of the common stock at the time of purchase the nonqualified employee stock purchase plan is intended for use primarily by employees of the company located outside the united states under the plan eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10 of compensation the price per share is the lower of 85 of the market price at the beginning or end of each sixmonth offering period

item 1    business

overview

alpha industries inc a delaware corporation manufactures and markets
proprietary radio frequency and microwave integrated circuit products and
solutions primarily for wireless communications our products include modules
integrated circuits and discrete components as well as components based on
electrical ceramic and ferrite technology the primary applications for our
products are wireless handsets and wireless base station equipment together
with wireless local area network wide area network and local loop applications

products and applications

we offer a broad array of products including gallium arsenide semiconductor
integrated circuit switches controls and power amplifiers silicon discrete
semiconductors ceramicbased components and multichip modules a typical
wireless handset contains radio frequency and baseband components we are
focused on providing radio frequency components that convert switch process
and amplify the high frequency signals that carry the information to be
transmitted or received see note 10 of item 7 of this form 10k for tabular
disclosure of selected financial data by business segment

power amplifiers wireless communications systems require amplification to
transmit and receive signals the power amplifier gives the radio signal the
energy to travel farther the power efficiency of gallium arsenide semiconductor
based power amplifiers offer superior performance to silicon solutions we have
been an innovator of gallium arsenide semiconductor based power amplifier
products we were the first merchant semiconductor company to offer a
threevolt highefficiency power amplifier integrated circuit based on
pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor process or phemt for the gsm
wireless standard operating at three different frequencies we were also the
first merchant semiconductor company to deliver a threevolt metal semiconductor
field effect transistor or mesfet gallium arsenide semiconductor based power
amplifier integrated circuit our power amplifier business is supported by our
experience with gallium arsenide heterojunction bipolar transistor or hbt
gallium arsenide phemt and gallium arsenide mesfet semiconductor processes

integrated circuit switches and controls switching and control functions route
and adjust signal levels between the receiver and transmitter and other
processing devices the number of switching functions increases with the design
complexity of the handset our gallium arsenide integrated circuit switches are
used in handsets to provide lower signal loss and better signal isolation than
comparable products our highefficiency gallium arsenide switch integrated
circuits integrate logic elements making the circuits easier for our customers
to use

discrete semiconductors discrete semiconductors especially diodes are used
for signal tuning and switching functions in the handset we draw on our
microwave frequency and millimeter wave frequency experience to produce diodes
with enhanced circuit performance we manufacture these products in high volumes
for several handset manufacturers

multichip modules multichip modules combine semiconductor devices such as
integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors in a single modulebased
platform the result is an easytomanufacture solution that enables wireless
manufacturers to reduce design complexity and dramatically shorten their product
development cycle

ceramic products our ceramic products play a critical role in processing
communications signals ceramic materials allow improved power efficiency and
miniaturization in wireless communications infrastructure

marketing and distribution

we sell our products through independent manufacturers representatives and
distribution partners and through a direct sales staff we also distribute our
products through a global organization that is franchised throughout portions of
the world and through two organizations that focus primarily on the north
american market we maintain an internal marketing organization that is
responsible for developing sales and advertising literature such as product
announcements catalogs brochures and magazine articles in trade and other
publications

we believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets
demands an extraordinary commitment to close ongoing relationships with our
customers we strive to maintain close contact with our customers design
engineering manufacturing purchasing and project management personnel we
employ a team approach in developing close relationships by combining the
support of design and applications engineers manufacturing personnel sales and
marketing staff and senior management we believe that maintaining close contact
with our customers improves their level of satisfaction assists us in
anticipating their future product needs and enhances our opportunities for
design wins

research and development

our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances
recognizing this we maintain a high level of research and development
activities to remain competitive in certain areas and to be an industry leader
in other areas we maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our
customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to
meet those demands we are focusing our development efforts on new products
design tools and manufacturing processes in our semiconductor products segment
using our core technologies

our rd expenditures for fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 were 416 million 360
million and 253 million respectively

raw materials

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally
available from several sources it is our policy not to depend on a sole source
of supply however there are limited situations where we procure certain
components and services for our products from single or limited sources we
purchase these materials and services on a purchase order basis we do not carry
significant inventories and have longterm supply contracts with only a limited
number of our vendors

working capital

our business is not seasonal and there are no special practices with respect to
working capital for us or the industry in general we provide a limited warranty
on our products against defects in material and workmanship payment terms are
generally 30 days in the domestic market and 60 days in foreign markets

customers

during fiscal year 2002 one customer accounted for 31 of the companys total
net sales during fiscal year 2001 two customers accounted for 26 and 11
respectively of the companys total sales in fiscal 2000 one customer
accounted for 34 of the companys total net sales in fiscal 2002 net sales to
the companys 15 largest customers accounted for 67 of total net sales in
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 net


                                       3

alpha industries inc and subsidiaries

sales to the companys 15 largest customers accounted for 69 and 65
respectively of total net sales as of march 31 2002 and april 1 2001 one
customer accounted for approximately 25 and 16 respectively of the companys
gross accounts receivable

competitive conditions

we compete on the basis of price performance quality reliability size
ability to meet delivery requirements and customer service and support however
we experience intense competition worldwide from a number of multinational
companies that offer a variety of competitive products and broader product
lines and which have substantially greater financial resources and production
marketing manufacturing engineering and other capabilities than we do we also
face competition from a number of smaller companies in addition our customers
particularly our largest customers may have or could acquire the capability to
develop or manufacture products competitive with those that have been or may be
developed or manufactured by us see note 10 of item 7 of this form 10k for
tabular disclosure of selected financial data by business segment

patents and trademarks

we own certain patents and have other patent applications under preparation or
pending however we believe that our technological position depends primarily
on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical
competence of our engineering personnel

backlog

our policy is to book only the next three months of commercial orders consistent
with customer shortterm requirements many commercial orders cover
substantially more than three months of performance but such orders can be
easily modified or canceled by the customer and we believe it is a better
practice to limit bookings in this manner on this basis we believe all orders
in our backlog to be firm however current market conditions make predictions
about future operations particularly difficult while we believe all orders in
our backlog to be firm our operating results have been materially and adversely
affected in the past by deferral and cancellation of orders as a result of
changes in customer requirements

we have backlog of undelivered orders on march 31 2002 of approximately 206
million compared with 387 million on april 1 2001

environmental regulations

in our opinion compliance with federal state and local environmental
protection regulations does not and will not have a material effect on our
capital expenditures earnings and competitive position

employees

as of march 31 2002 we employed approximately 935 persons compared with 1120
persons as of april 1 2001

from time to time various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been and may in
the future be instituted or asserted against alpha including those pertaining
to patent infringement intellectual property environmental product liability
safety and health employment and contractual matters the outcome of litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may
be disposed of unfavorably to alpha intellectual property disputes often have a
risk of injunctive relief which if imposed against alpha could materially and
adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of alpha

the company and its subsidiary skyworks solutions inc are presently engaged
in a lawsuit filed june 6 2002 in the united states district court for the
central district of california southern division by skyworks technologies

item 7    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
          results of operations

overview

we design develop manufacture and market proprietary radio frequency
microwave frequency and millimeter wave frequency integrated circuits discrete
semiconductors and integrated modules for the wireless and broadband
communications markets we also design develop manufacture and market
proprietary technical ceramic and magnetic products for the wireless
infrastructure and broadband markets a description of the reportable segments
follows

the semiconductor products segment designs and manufactures gallium arsenide
integrated circuits other discrete semiconductors and multichip modules
primarily for the global wireless communications and broadband markets this
segment represented 81 of our total sales in fiscal 2002

the ceramic products segment designs and manufactures technical ceramic and
magnetic products primarily for the global wireless infrastructure and broadband
markets this segment represented 19 of our total sales in fiscal 2002

our customers include leading oems in the wireless and broadband communications
industry and their principal suppliers during fiscal 2002 sales to our 15
largest customers accounted for 67 of our total sales during that period
sales to motorola accounted for 31 of total sales

on april 24 2000 we completed our acquisition of privatelyheld network
device inc ndi of sunnyvale california approximately 267 million shares
of common stock of the company were exchanged for all outstanding shares of ndi
approximately 185000 shares of company stock were reserved for the conversion
of ndi stock options into company options the acquisition has been accounted
for as a poolingofinterests and accordingly all prior period consolidated
financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements
have been restated to include the combined results of operations financial
position and cash flows of ndi

on december 16 2001 the company conexant systems inc conexant and
washington sub inc washington a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant
entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of conexants
wireless business with the company under the terms of the agreement conexant
would spin off its wireless business including its gallium arsenide wafer
fabrication facility located in newbury park california but excluding certain
assets and liabilities to be followed immediately by a merger of this wireless
business into the company with the company as the surviving company in the
merger this merger was completed on june 25 2002  following the merger the
company changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc

immediately after the merger the company had approximately 140 million fully
diluted shares outstanding with current shareholders of the company owning
approximately 33 percent and current shareholders of conexant owning
approximately 67 percent of the companys outstanding shares on a fully diluted
basis

the merger is to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington is
treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree primarily because conexant
shareholders owned a majority of the combined company upon completion of the
merger under a reverse acquisition the purchase price of alpha is based upon
the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time
before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha
stock options  the purchase price of alpha will be allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by washington as the acquiring company for
accounting purposes based upon their estimated fair market value at the
acquisition date  the historical carrying value of the assets liabilities and
stockholders equity included in these financial statements may be revised
significantly as a result of the merger transaction information regarding these
changes is not available at this time

immediately following completion of the merger the company purchased conexants
semiconductor assembly module manufacturing and test facility located in
mexicali mexico and certain related operations the mexicali operations for
150 million  this purchase price was paid with shortterm promissory notes
delivered by the company to conexant which are secured by all of the assets of
the company  unless paid earlier at the option of the company or pursuant to
mandatory prepayment provisions in the financing agreement fifty percent of the
principal portion of the shortterm promissory notes is due on march 24 2003
and the remaining fifty percent of the notes is due on june 24 2003


                                       9

in addition the combined company has incurred expenses and has assumed
obligations as a result of this merger  the company estimates that these
expenses and obligations will require cash of approximately 80 million to 90
million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase approximately one million
shares of the companys common stock  these amounts are primarily associated
with transaction and merger costs deposits and restructuring costs  the
combined company will recognize a charge related to these expenses and
obligations of approximately 20 to 30 million in the quarter ended june 28
2002  these amounts represent the current estimates of management based on the
information available at this time and are subject to change

in addition to the shortterm promissory notes related to the companys purchase
of the mexicali operations conexant committed to make a shortterm 100 million
revolving loan facility available to the company to fund the companys working
capital and other requirements  75 million of this facility will be available
on or after july 10 2002 and the remaining 25 million balance of the
revolving facility will be available if the company has more than 150 million
of eligible domestic receivables  the entire principal of any revolving amounts
borrowed is due on june 24 2003

critical accounting policies and estimates

general

managements discussion and analysis of alphas financial condition and results
of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial
statements requires alpha to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the
company evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts
inventories income taxes restructuring charges and contingencies and
litigation the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements

revenue recognition

the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin
no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 as amended by
sab 101a and 101b sab 101 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2
delivery has occurred or services rendered 3 the price to the buyer is fixed
and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of
criteria 3 and 4 are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed
nature of the price to the buyer charged for products delivered and services
rendered and collectibility of the sales price the companys shipping terms are
customarily fob shipping point provisions for product returns and allowances
are recorded in the same period as the related revenue the company analyzes
historical returns current economic trends and changes in customer demand and
acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and
other allowances

page
                                         alpha industries inc and subsidiaries

bad debt

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the
financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make future payments additional allowances
may be required

inventories

the company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual demand and
market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management
additional inventory write downs may be required

valuation of deferred income taxes

the carrying value of the companys net deferred tax assets assumes that the
company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax
jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and
related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record
additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in
additional income tax expense in the companys consolidated statement of
operations management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets
and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly likewise in the
event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its
deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such
determination was made

impairment of longlived assets and longlived assets to be disposed of

the company accounts for impairment of longlived assets in accordance with sfas
no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived
assets to be disposed of this statement requires that longlived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be
impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell this statement has not had a material impact on the companys
financial position results of operations or liquidity

fiscal years ended march 31 2002 april 1 2001 and april 2 2000

net sales net sales decreased 534 to 1265 million in fiscal 2002 from
2716 million in fiscal 2001 the decline in net sales is attributable to the
downturn in the wireless handset wireless infrastructure and broadband markets
this downturn had a significant effect on both of our business segments
semiconductor products and ceramic products during fiscal 2002 net sales
increased 457 to 2716 million in fiscal 2001 from 1864 million in fiscal
2000 the increase was principally the result of high growth experienced by our
semiconductor and ceramic products segments during the first nine months of
fiscal 2001 as demand for wireless and broadband products increased during this
period during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a downturn in the wireless and
broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales reducing the overall
increase in net sales during fiscal 2001 when compared to fiscal 2000
deliveries to motorola represented 311 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002
compared to 260 in fiscal 2001 and 341 in fiscal 2000 deliveries to
ericsson represented less than 10 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2001 ericsson represented 113 of our total net
sales

gross profit gross profit decreased 692 to 369 million in fiscal 2002 from
1199 million in fiscal 2001 gross margin decreased to 292 from 442 in
fiscal 2001 this decline is primarily the result of the decrease in net sales
and the resulting underutilization of manufacturing capacity gross profit
increased 484 to 1199 million in fiscal 2001 from 808 million in fiscal
2000 gross margin increased to 442 in fiscal 2001 from 434 in fiscal 2000
these increases were primarily attributable to our continued ability to leverage
capacity and improve operating efficiencies in both our semiconductor and
ceramic products segments during the first nine months of fiscal 2001 offset by
the effect of high fixed costs on lower sales experienced in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased
154 to 416 million or 329 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 360 million
or 133 of net sales in fiscal 2001 included in the 416 million is
approximately 25 million related to the writeoff of inprocess research and
development and amortization of intangible assets associated with our march 2002
purchase of aimta inc a developer of low temperature cofired ceramics ltcc
for wireless handsets excluding this charge research and development expenses
for fiscal 2002 would have totaled 391 million or 309 of net sales an
increase of 85 compared to fiscal 2001 the increase in research and
development expenses is the result of our commitment to design new products and
processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers demands this
sustained effort to meet our customers changing product requirements is
highlighted by our focus on the migration from individual chips to integrated
radio frequency module solutions research and

development expenses increased 422 to 360 million or 133 of net sales in
fiscal 2001 from 253 million or 136 of net sales in fiscal 2000 the
increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to our
ongoing development of processes and applications within our semiconductor
products segment in order to address our targeted markets wireless and
broadband

related to the incomplete project this project was approximately 80 complete
as of the date of acquisition as of the date of the acquisition the
development of this project had not reached technological feasibility and the
research and development in progress had no alternative future use accordingly
this cost was expensed at the acquisition date

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses
decreased 349 to 281 million or 222 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 433
million or 159 of net sales in fiscal 2001 included in the 281 million is
approximately 41 million in expenses related to the merger with the wireless
business of conexant inc excluding these mergerrelated expenses selling and
administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 would have totaled 240 million or
190 of net sales the decline in selling and administrative expenses was
primarily attributable to a reduction in workforce reduced discretionary
spending and a reduction in sales commission expenses approximately 30 of the
decrease was attributable to a reduction in workforce and a reduction in sales
commission expenses respectively the remaining 40 decrease was attributable
to an overall reduction in discretionary spending selling and administrative
expenses increased 268 to 433 million or 159 of net sales in fiscal 2001
from 341 million or 183 of net sales in fiscal 2000 included in the 433
million is approximately 18 million in onetime transaction costs associated
with the acquisition of ndi on april 24 2000 excluding these onetime costs
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal 2001 would have totaled 415
million or 153 of net sales an increase of 216 compared to fiscal 2000 the
increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to
increased direct selling costs resulting from higher sales volumes as well as
increased costs related to training and recruiting employees due to our
continued ability to support our sales growth without incurring substantial
additional costs selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
declined in fiscal 2001 when compared to fiscal 2000

other income net other income net decreased 358 to 55 million or 44 of
net sales in fiscal 2002 from 86 million or 32 of net sales in fiscal 2001
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in interest income as a
result of lower interest rates and lower average levels of cash cash
equivalents and shortterm investments other income net increased 471 to
86 million or 32 of net sales in fiscal 2001 from 59 million or 31 of
sales in fiscal 2000 the increase in other income net was primarily
attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of higher average
levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments

benefit provision for income taxes the benefit for income taxes in fiscal
2002 was 90 million compared to a provision for income taxes of 159 million
in fiscal 2001 the fiscal 2002 benefit reflects a tax rate of approximately 33
compared to a tax rate of 32 in fiscal 2001 the increase in the fiscal 2002
tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of research and
development tax credits during fiscal 2002 the provision for income taxes in
fiscal 2001 was 159 million compared to 93 million in fiscal 2000 the
fiscal 2001 provision reflects a tax rate of approximately 32 compared to a tax
rate of 34 in fiscal 2000

semiconductor products net sales for the semiconductor products segment
decreased 545 to 1022 million in fiscal 2002 from 2246 million in fiscal
2001 the decrease was primarily attributable to a downturn in both of our
targeted markets wireless communications and broadband net sales for the
semiconductor products segment increased 494 to 2246 million in fiscal 2001
from 1503 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to
increased demand and penetration into our two targeted markets wireless
communications and broadband during the first nine months of fiscal 2001 during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a downturn in the wireless and broadband
markets resulted in lower quarterly sales reducing the overall increase in
sales during fiscal 2001

operating loss income for the semiconductor products segment decreased to an
operating loss of 281 million in fiscal 2002 compared to operating income of
353 million in fiscal 2001 the decline was primarily the result of lower
revenue underutilization of capacity and the continued investment in research
and development during fiscal 2002 operating income for the semiconductor
products segment increased 998 to 353 million in fiscal 2001 from 168
million in fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to increased
sales and improved operating efficiencies as this segment continued to leverage
capacity improve yields and control selling and administrative costs

ceramic products net sales for the ceramic products segment decreased 484 to
243 million in fiscal 2002 from 470 million in fiscal 2001 the decline was
primarily attributable to a downturn in the wireless infrastructure and
broadband markets sales for the ceramic products segment increased 304 to
470 million in fiscal 2001 from 361 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was
primarily due to growth in demand and increased penetration in the wireless
infrastructure and broadband markets for the first nine months of fiscal 2001
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a downturn in the wireless and
broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales reducing the overall
increase in sales during fiscal 2001

operating loss income for the ceramic products segment decreased to an
operating loss of 556000 in fiscal 2002 compared to operating income of 72
million in fiscal 2001 the decline was primarily the result of lower revenue
levels in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001 operating income for the
ceramic products segment increased 547 to 72 million in fiscal 2001 from
46 million in fiscal 2000

the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales and
improved operating efficiencies including the leveraging of existing capacity
and the investment in more costeffective equipment

mergerrelated expenses

during fiscal 2002 we incurred approximately 41 million of which 21
million was incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2002 in mergerrelated
expenses associated with our merger with conexants wireless business during
fiscal 2001 we incurred approximately 18 million in expenses associated with
our acquisition of ndi which was completed on april 24 2000

liquidity and capital resources

as of march 31 2002 we had working capital of 1363 million including 1141
million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments annualized
inventory turns decreased to 73 in fiscal 2002 compared to 97 in fiscal 2001
additionally days sales outstanding included in accounts receivable for fiscal
2002 increased to 71 days compared to 50 days in fiscal 2002 we continued to
manage our working capital during the downturn in the wireless communications
and broadband markets we reduced inventory levels and managed our investment in
capital expenditures while maintaining our commitment to investment in research
and development and maintaining our manufacturing capability

capital expenditures during fiscal 2002 totaled 410 million of the 410
million approximately 385 million related to the semiconductor products
segment as we continued our investment in major capital initiatives in the
semiconductor gallium arsenide gaas wafer fabrication operation and the
integrated circuit ic and discrete semiconductor assembly and test areas we
are creating a gaas ic production line that will allow the manufacture of
product on sixinch wafers as of march 31 2002 we have spent approximately
27 million on this production line and we expect to complete this project
within six months at an estimated cost of 30 million once this new sixinch
production line is put into service we plan to convert our existing fourinch
wafer production areas to sixinch as future demand requires improvements in
manufacturing capabilities at our ceramics facilities accounted for
approximately 25 million

on april 24 2000 we announced the completion of our acquisition of
privatelyheld network device inc based in sunnyvale california
approximately 267 million shares of common stock of the company were exchanged
for all outstanding shares of ndi approximately 185000 shares of company stock
were reserved for the conversion of ndi stock options into company options the
acquisition has been accounted for as a poolingofinterests

on december 16 2001 the company conexant systems inc conexant and
washington sub inc washington a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant
entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of conexants
wireless business with the company under the terms of the agreement conexant
would spin off its wireless business including its gallium arsenide wafer
fabrication facility located in newbury park california but excluding certain
assets and liabilities to be followed immediately by a merger of this wireless
business into the company with the company as the surviving company in the
merger this merger was completed on june 25 2002 following the merger the
company changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions inc

immediately after the merger the company had approximately 140 million fully
diluted shares outstanding with current shareholders of the company owning
approximately 33

alpha industries inc and subsidiaries

percent and current shareholders of conexant owning approximately 67 percent of
the companys outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis

the merger is to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington is
treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree primarily because conexant
shareholders owned a majority of the combined company upon completion of the
merger  under a reverse acquisition the purchase price of alpha is based upon
the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time
before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha
stock options  the purchase price of alpha will be allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by washington as the acquiring company for
accounting purposes based upon their estimated fair market value at the
acquisition date  the historical carrying value of the assets liabilities and
stockholders equity included in these financial statements may be revised
significantly as a result of the merger transaction information regarding these
changes is not available at this time

immediately following completion of the merger the company purchased conexants
semiconductor assembly module manufacturing and test facility located in
mexicali mexico and certain related operations the mexicali operations for
150 million  this purchase price was paid with shortterm promissory notes
delivered by the company to conexant which are secured by all of the assets of
the company  unless paid earlier at the option of the company or pursuant to
mandatory prepayment provisions in the financing agreement fifty percent of the
principal portion of the shortterm promissory notes is due on march 24 2003
and the remaining fifty percent of the notes is due on june 24 2003

in addition the combined company has incurred expenses and has assumed
obligations as a result of this merger  the company estimates that these
expenses and obligations will require cash of approximately 80 million to 90
million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase approximately one million
shares of the companys common stock  these amounts are primarily associated
with transaction and merger costs deposits and restructuring costs  the
combined company will recognize a charge related to these expenses and
obligations of approximately 20 to 30 million in the quarter ended june 28
2002  these amounts represent the current estimates of management based on the
information available at this time and are subject to change

in addition to the shortterm promissory notes related to the companys purchase
of the mexicali operations conexant committed to make a shortterm 100 million
revolving loan facility available to the company to fund the companys working
capital and other requirements  75 million of this facility will be available
on or after july 10 2002 and the remaining 25 million balance of the
revolving facility will be available if the company has more than 150 million
of eligible domestic receivables  the entire principal of any revolving amounts
borrowed is due on june 24 2003

forwardlooking statements

this report and other documents we have filed with the securities and exchange
commission contain forwardlooking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 some of the
forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terms
such as believes expects may will should could seek
intends plans estimates anticipates or other comparable terms
forwardlooking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties a number of
important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in
the forwardlooking statements we urge you to consider the risks and
uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in the other
documents filed with the sec in evaluating our forwardlooking statements we
have no plans to update our forwardlooking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this report

we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and anticipate future
losses during fiscal 2002 our operating results were adversely affected by a
global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the
enduser products that incorporate wireless communications semiconductor
products and system solutions as a result we incurred a net loss of
approximately 183 million during fiscal 2002

during fiscal 2002 we implemented a number of expense reduction initiatives
including a work force reduction a modification of employee work schedules and
reduced discretionary spending we expect that reduced endcustomer demand
underutilization of our manufacturing capacity changes in our revenue mix and
other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the
near term in order to return to profitability we must achieve substantial
revenue growth and we will face an environment of uncertain demand in the
markets for our products we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will
return to profitability or whether we will be able to sustain such
profitability if achieved

we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor
industry which is subject to significant downturns the wireless communications
semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and
rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion
evolving technical standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in
product supply and demand from time to time these and other factors together
with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and
downturns in the industry periods of industry downturns  as we experienced
through most of calendar year 2001  have been characterized by diminished
product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices these factors and in particular the level of
demand for digital cellular handsets may cause substantial fluctuations in our
revenues and results of operations we have experienced these cyclical
fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the
future

during the late 1990s and extending into 2000 the wireless communications
semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid
expansion of wireless communication services worldwide and increased demand for
digital cellular handsets during calendar year 2001 we were adversely impacted
by a global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the
enduser products that incorporate our respective wireless communications
semiconductor products and system solutions particularly digital cellular
handsets the impact of weakened endcustomer demand was compounded by higher
than normal levels of inventories among our original equipment manufacturer or
oem subcontractor and distributor customers we expect that reduced
endcustomer demand underutilization of the our manufacturing capacity changes
in revenue mix and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating
results in the near term

alpha industries inc and subsidiaries

we are subject to intense competition the wireless communications semiconductor
industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are
intensely competitive we compete with us and international semiconductor
manufacturers that are both larger and smaller than us in terms of resources and
market share we currently face significant competition in our markets and
expect that intense price and product competition will continue this
competition has resulted and is expected to continue to result in declining
average selling prices for our products we also anticipate that additional
competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in
communications electronics the trend toward global expansion by foreign and
domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes moreover as
with many companies in the semiconductor industry customers for certain of our
products offer products that compete with products that are offered by us

we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in
our market include among others

         timetomarket

         new product innovation

         product quality reliability and performance

         price

         compliance with industry standards

         strategic relationships with customers and

         protection of intellectual property

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors

many of our competitors have advantages over us including

         longer presence in key markets

         greater name recognition

         ownership or control of key technology and

         greater financial sales and marketing manufacturing distribution
          technical or other resources

as a result certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than us to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able
to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their
products than we can

current and potential competitors also have established or may establish
financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers
resellers or other third parties these relationships may affect customers
purchasing decisions accordingly it is possible that new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against
current and potential competitors

a number of our competitors have combined with each other and consolidated their
businesses including the consolidation of competitors with our customers this
consolidation is attributable to a number of factors including the historically
highgrowth nature of the communications electronics industry and the
timetomarket pressures on suppliers to decrease the time required for product
conception research and development sampling and production launch before a
product reaches the market this consolidation trend is expected to continue
since investments alliances and acquisitions may enable semiconductor
suppliers including us and our competitors to achieve economies of scale to
augment technical capabilities or to achieve faster timetomarket for their
products than would be possible solely through internal development

this consolidation is creating entities with increased market share customer
base technology and marketing expertise in markets in which we compete these
developments may adversely affect the markets we seek to serve and our ability
to compete successfully in those markets

our success will depend upon our ability to develop new products and reduce
costs in a timely manner the markets into which we sell demand cuttingedge
technologies and new and innovative products our operating results will depend
largely on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a
timely basis successful product development and introduction depends on
numerous factors including among others

         the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes
          in technology and industry standards

         the ability to define new products that meet customer and market
          requirements

         the ability to complete development of new products and bring products
          to market on a timely basis

         the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our
          competitors and

         overall market acceptance of our products

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the
substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring
to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner we will be required
continually to evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to
choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market
growth we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new
or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and
costeffective manner that our products will satisfy customer requirements or
achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry
standards and technological changes we also cannot assure you that we will be
able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by
competitors

in addition prices of established products may decline sometimes
significantly over time we believe that in order to remain competitive we must
continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the
same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products we cannot
assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products
to remain competitive

we may not be able to keep abreast of the rapid technological changes in our
markets the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not
anticipate our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics

         rapid technological developments

         rapid changes in customer requirements

         frequent new product introductions and enhancements

         short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of
          the product and

         evolving industry standards

our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated
because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies
related to our products or in market demand for products based on a particular
technology particularly due to the introduction of new technology that
represents a substantial advance over current technology currently accepted
industry standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the
obsolescence of our products

our success depends in part on our ability to obtain suitable financing

upon completion of the companys merger with the wireless business of conexant
systems inc the company purchased conexants semiconductor assembly module
manufacturing and test facility located in mexicali mexico and certain
related operations for 150 million  this purchase price was paid with
shortterm promissory notes delivered by the company to conexant which are
secured by all of the assets of the company  unless paid earlier at the option
of the company or pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions in the financing
agreement fifty percent of the principal portion of the shortterm promissory
notes is due on march 24 2003 and the remaining fifty percent of the notes is
due on june 24 2003


                                       19

in addition the combined company has incurred expenses and has assumed
obligations as a result of this merger  the company estimates that these
expenses and obligations will require cash of approximately 80 million to 90
million and the issuance of a warrant to purchase approximately one million
shares of the companys common stock  these amounts are primarily associated
with transaction and merger costs deposits and restructuring costs  the
combined company will recognize a charge related to these expenses and
obligations of approximately 20 to 30 million in the quarter ended june 28
2002  these amounts represent the current estimates of management based on the
information available at this time and are subject to change

in addition to the shortterm promissory notes related to the companys purchase
of the mexicali operations conexant committed to make a shortterm 100 million
revolving loan facility available to the company to fund the companys working
capital and other requirements  75 million of this facility will be available
on or after july 10 2002 and the remaining 25 million balance of the
revolving facility will be available if the company has more than 150 million
of eligible domestic receivables  the entire principal of any revolving amounts
borrowed is due on june 24 2003

the companys ability to meet these expenses the expenses of our ongoing
operations and to repay the debt owed to conexant is dependent upon our ability
to obtain suitable financing  we cannot assure you that the capital required to
fund these expenses will be available in the future  conditions existing in the
us capital markets when the company seeks financing will affect its ability to
raise capital as well as the terms of any financing  the company may not be
able to raise enough capital to meet its capital needs on a timely basis or at
all  failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse
effect on the company

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the
design development manufacture and sale of our products our success could be
negatively affected if key personnel leave

our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract retain and
motivate qualified personnel including executive officers and other key
management and technical personnel as the source of our technological and
product innovations our key technical personnel represent a significant asset
the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the
semiconductor industry we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and
retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design
development manufacture and sale of our products

we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during
periods of poor operating performance given among other things the use of
equitybased compensation by us and our competitors the loss of the services of
one or more of our key employees including david j aldrich our chief
executive officer or certain key design and technical personnel or our
inability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business

if oems of communications electronics products do not design our products into
their equipment we will have difficulty selling those products moreover a
design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer
our products will not be sold directly to the enduser but will be components of
other products as a result we will rely on oems of wireless communications
electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to
be designed into their equipment without these design wins from oems we
would have difficulty selling our products once an oem designs another
suppliers product into one of its product platforms it is more difficult for
us to achieve future design wins with that oem product platform because changing
suppliers involves significant cost time effort and risk for that oem also
achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive
significant revenues from that customer even after a design win the customer
is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce
or cease use of the our products for example if its own products are not
commercially successful or for any other reason we may be unable to achieve
design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales

because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products we may incur
significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products
our customers may need three to six months to test and evaluate our products and
an additional three to six months to begin volume production of equipment that
incorporates our products the lengthy period of time required increases the
possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans which
could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer as a result of this
lengthy sales cycle we may incur significant research and development and
selling general and administrative expenses before we generate the related
revenues for these products and we may never generate the anticipated revenues
if our customer cancels or changes its product plans

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could
adversely affect our business our sales will typically be made pursuant to
individual purchase orders and not under longterm supply arrangements with our
customers our customers may cancel orders prior to shipment in addition we
will sell a portion of our products through distributors some of whom will have
rights to return unsold products sales to distributors accounted for
approximately 7 12 and 5 of alphas net revenues in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001
and fiscal 2000 respectively we may purchase and manufacture inventory based
on estimates of customer demand for our products which is difficult to predict
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through
distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts of demand will
then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our
customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason
the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold
products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to


                                       20

materialize could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory which could
result in writedowns of inventory

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations a significant
portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers if we
lost one or more of these major customers or if one or more major customers
significantly decreased its orders our business would be materially and
adversely affected sales to motorola inc represented approximately 31 26
and 38 of alpha net revenues in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
respectively our future operating results will depend on the success of this
and other customers and our success in selling products to them

our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized our
manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption due to causes
beyond our control the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely
complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps it
requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minor impurities
errors in any step of the fabrication process defects in the masks used to
print circuits on a wafer or a number of other factors can cause a substantial
percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer not to
function

our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce
integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields our operations may be
affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our
production facilities or those of our subcontractors these disruptions may
include electrical power outages fire earthquake flooding or other natural
disasters our sunnyvale california manufacturing facility is located near a
major earthquake fault line we do not maintain earthquake insurance coverage on
this facility disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause
significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an
affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor

in the event of these types of delays we cannot assure you that the required
alternate capacity particularly wafer production capacity would be available
on a timely basis or at all even if alternate wafer production capacity is
available we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms which could
result in higher costs andor a loss of customers we may be unable to obtain
sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand either at our own facilities
or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others

due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit
manufacturing process in the event of a disruption at the sunnyvale california
or woburn massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities alternate
gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from
thirdparty sources these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on
our business financial condition and results of operations

we may not be able to achieve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to
our gross margin and profitability minor deviations in the manufacturing
process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss and in some cases cause
production to be suspended manufacturing yields for new products initially tend
to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume
manufacturing and typically increase as we bring the product to full
production our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving
manufacturing yields and as a result material variances between projected and
actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and
profitability the difficulty of forecasting manufacturing yields accurately and
maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will
continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing
semiconductor products our manufacturing operations also will face pressures
arising from the compression of product life cycles which will require us to
manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining
acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without in many cases reaching the
longerterm highvolume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields
and declining costs

we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally for fiscal 2002
approximately 55 of alphas net revenues were from customers located outside
the united states primarily countries located in the asiapacific region and
europe in fiscal 2001 and 2000 approximately 49 and 46 respectively of
alphas net revenues were from customers located outside the united states in
addition we have suppliers located outside the united states and thirdparty
packaging assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the
asiapacific region our international sales and operations are subject to a
number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad these include but are
not limited to risks regarding

         currency exchange rate fluctuations

         local economic and political conditions

         disruptions of capital and trading markets

         restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on transfer of
          funds and trade protection measures including export duties and
          quotas and customs duties and tariffs

         changes in legal or regulatory requirements

         limitations on the repatriation of funds

         difficulty in obtaining distribution and support

         the laws and policies of the united states and other countries
          affecting trade foreign investment and loans and import or export
          licensing requirements

         tax laws and

         limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our
          intellectual property

because our international sales are denominated in us dollars our products
could become less competitive in international markets if the value of the us
dollar increases relative to foreign currencies moreover we may be
competitively disadvantaged relative to our competitors located outside the
united states who may benefit from a devaluation of their local currency we
cannot assure you that the factors described above will not have a material
adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our international sales

our operating results may be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and
annual fluctuations and market downturns our revenues earnings and other
operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues earnings and
other operating results may fluctuate in the future these fluctuations are due
to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors
include among others

         changes in enduser demand for the products manufactured and sold by
          our customers principally digital cellular handsets

         the effects of competitive pricing pressures including decreases in
          average selling prices of our products

         production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

         availability and cost of products from our suppliers

         the gain or loss of significant customers

         our ability to develop introduce and market new products and
          technologies on a timely basis

         new product and technology introductions by competitors

         changes in the mix of products produced and sold

         market acceptance of our products and our customers

         intellectual property disputes

         seasonal customer demand

         the timing of receipt reduction or cancellation of significant orders
          by customers and

         the timing and extent of product development costs

the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other
factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating
results if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or
investors it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common
stock

our gallium arsenide semiconductors may not continue to be competitive with
silicon alternatives we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductors
principally power amplifiers and switches the production of gallium arsenide
integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits as a
result we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior
performance to that of silicon for specific applications to be competitive with
silicon products if we do not continue to offer products that provide
sufficiently superior performance to offset the cost differential our operating
results may be materially and adversely affected it is expected that the costs
of producing gallium arsenide integrated circuits will continue to exceed the
costs associated with the production of silicon circuits the costs differ
because of higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit
costs associated with smallersized wafers and lower production volumes silicon
semiconductor technologies are widelyused process technologies for certain
integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance
we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that
require performance superior to that offered by silicon solutions

the value of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly this price
may be influenced by many factors including

         our performance and prospects

         the performance and prospects of our major customers

         the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock

         investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate

         changes in earnings estimates or buysell recommendations by analysts

         general financial and other market conditions and

         domestic and international economic conditions

public stock markets have experienced and are currently experiencing extreme
price and trading volume volatility particularly in the technology sectors of
the market this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of
securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or
disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our
common stock

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property
rights or demands that we license thirdparty technology which could result in
significant expense and loss of our intellectual property rights the
semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights from time to time third parties have asserted and
may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual
property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have
demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology any
litigation to determine the validity of claims our products infringe or may
infringe these rights including claims arising from our contractual
indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could
be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical
personnel regardless of the merits of any specific claim we cannot assure you
that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and
inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if litigation were
to result in an adverse ruling we could be required to

         pay substantial damages

         cease the manufacture import use sale or offer for sale of
          infringing products

         discontinue the use of infringing technology

         expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology or

         license technology from the third party claiming infringement which
          license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights it may
harm our ability to compete we rely on patent copyright trademark trade
secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary

technologies devices algorithms and processes in addition we often
incorporate the intellectual property of our customers suppliers or other third
parties into our designs and we have obligations with respect to the nonuse
and nondisclosure of such thirdparty intellectual property in the future it
may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our
intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the
validity and scope of proprietary rights of others including our customers
this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts
and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business
operations we cannot assure you that

         the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other
          violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of
          our customers suppliers or other third parties will be successful

         any existing or future patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets
          or other intellectual property rights will not be challenged
          invalidated or circumvented or

         any of the measures described above would provide meaningful
          protection

despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization develop similar
technology independently or design around our patents if any of our patents
fails to protect our technology it would make it easier for our competitors to
offer similar products in addition effective patent copyright trademark and
trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies
and in certain foreign countries

our success depends in part on our ability to effect suitable investments
alliances and acquisitions and we may have difficulty integrating companies we
acquire the companys merger with the wireless business of conexant systems
inc presents such risks

although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and
development activities the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and
the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical
for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own on an
ongoing basis we intend to review investment alliance and acquisition
prospects that would complement our product offerings augment our market
coverage or enhance our technological capabilities however we cannot assure
you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment
alliance or acquisition transactions in the future

moreover if we consummate such transactions they could result in

         issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders

         large onetime writeoffs

         the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown
          liabilities

         the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company

         amortization expenses related to intangible assets and

         the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns

additionally in periods following an acquisition we will be required to
evaluate goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when
such assets are found to be impaired they will be written down to estimated
fair value with a charge against earnings

integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be
difficult expensive timeconsuming and a strain on our resources and our
relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful

we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws rules and regulations
which could adversely impact our business we have used and will continue to
use a variety of chemicals in manufacturing operations and have been or will be
subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united
states while we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our

operations as a result of such regulations we cannot assure you that current or
future regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations

environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action
regardless of fault consequently it is often difficult to estimate the future
impact of environmental matters including potential liabilities we cannot
assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be
required to satisfy environmental liabilities to complete remedial actions and
to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a
material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of
operations

semiconductor products

the diagram below illustrates the role of many of our semiconductor products in
a dual band and dual mode wireless telephone handset


                     dual banddual mode handset diagram


power amplifiers wireless communications systems require amplification in
receiving and transmitting signals relatively weak incoming signals must be
amplified without adding background noise gaas power amplifiers are used in
handsets because they use battery power more efficiently than silicon
amplifiers and battery life is a critical system feature in these portable
applications we have been a leader in innovative gaas power amplifier ics we
were the first merchant semiconductor company to offer a three volt
highefficiency phemt power amplifier ic for gsm operating at three different
frequencies this product has been in continuous production for more than a
year we were also the first to deliver a three volt mesfet gaas power amplifier
ic which has now been in continuous highvolume production for more than three
years in addition our acquisition of ndi has provided us with gaas hbt process
technology which has opened new power amplifier opportunities and complements
our strength in the gaas phemt and gaas mesfet processes

integrated circuit switches and controls switching and control functions route
and adjust signal levels between the receiver and transmitter and other
processing devices the number of switching functions increases with the
complexity of the handset design in the dual banddual mode handset
illustrated the switches perform three different routing functions including
signal routing to transmitter or receiver signal routing to cellular or pcs
frequency and signal routing to digital or analog mode

our gaas integrated circuit switches are used in handsets to provide lower
signal loss and better signal isolation than comparable products our
ultrahighefficiency gaas phemt switch ics integrate logic elements making
their usage even easier for our oem customers the gaas hbt process has not been
suitable for switches

discrete semiconductors discrete semiconductors especially diodes are used
for signal tuning and switching functions in the handset we draw on our
microwave frequency and millimeter wave frequency experience to produce diodes
with better circuit performance we manufacture these products in very high
volumes for several handset oems

multichip modules multichip modules combine various semiconductor processes
such as hbt phemt and rf discrete semiconductors in a single modulebased
platform the result is an easytomanufacture solution that enables broadband
and wireless oems to reduce design complexity and dramatically shorten their
product development cycle

ceramic products

our ceramic products play a critical role in the signal selection or filtering
process that is essential to processing communications signals ceramic
materials allow improved power efficiency and miniaturization and are being
increasingly used in wireless communications infrastructure additionally

module packaging technology during fiscal 2001 is evidence of our focus in this
area further evidence of our commitment to rd is our introduction of the
worlds first triband power amplifier module employing ingap hbt process
technology and the introduction of breakthrough switchfilter technology for
wireless handsets the switchfilter products combine multiple functions in a
single modulebased platform and utilize our aiip technique

gaas hbt capabilities on april 24 2000 we acquired ndi of sunnyvale
california the acquisition provided a productionready ingap hbt process
enabling the production of high efficiency hbt power amplifiers for wireless
telephone handsets gaas hbt process technology works at higher frequencies and
requires less power to transmit signals than traditional silicon semiconductors
and it provides greater efficiency and linearity than gaas mesfet devices for
cellular telephones this permits smaller handsets and longer talktime between
battery charges hbt power amplifiers are also particularly well suited for use
in the emerging wireless and broadband markets the addition of a line of gaas
hbt products has complemented our existing gaas phemt and gaas mesfet devices
enabling us to offer our customers the full range of currently available gaas
processes for use in wireless telephone handsets wireless data applications and
broadband data applications

during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we shipped our first volume order of a
new family of broadband amplifiers the first products based on our advanced
ingap hbt technology for use in a wide range of wireless and broadband
applications

our rd expenditures for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 were 360 million 253
million and 159 million respectively

raw materials

raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally
available from several sources it is our policy not to depend on a sole source
of supply however there are limited situations where we procure certain
components and services for our products from single or limited sources we
purchase these materials and services on a purchase order basis we do not carry
significant inventories and have longterm supply contracts with only a limited
number of our vendors

working capital

our business is not seasonal and there are no special practices with respect to
working capital for us or the industry in general we provide a limited warranty
on our products against defects in material and workmanship payment terms are
generally 30 days in the domestic market and 60 days in foreign markets

customers

during fiscal 2001 motorola inc and ericsson accounted for approximately 26
and 11 respectively of our total sales

competitive conditions

we compete on the basis of price performance quality reliability size
ability to meet delivery requirements and customer service and support however
we experience intense competition worldwide from a number of multinational
companies that offer a variety of competitive products and broader product
lines and which have substantially greater financial resources and production
marketing manufacturing engineering and other capabilities than we do we also
face competition from a number of smaller companies in addition our customers
particularly our largest customers may have or could acquire the

capability to develop or manufacture products competitive with those that have
been or may be developed or manufactured by us

patents and trademarks

we own certain patents and have other patent applications under preparation or
pending however we believe that our technological position depends primarily
on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical
competence of our engineering personnel

backlog

our policy is to book only the next three months of commercial orders consistent
with customer shortterm requirements many commercial orders cover
substantially more than three months of performance but such orders can be
easily modified or cancelled by the customer and we believe it is a better
practice to limit bookings in this manner on this basis we believe all orders
in our backlog to be firm however current market conditions make predictions
about future operations particularly difficult while we believe all orders in
our backlog to be firm our operating results have been materially and adversely
affected in the past by deferral and cancellation of orders as a result of
changes in customer requirements

we have backlog of undelivered orders on april 1 2001 of approximately 387
million compared with 557 million on april 2 2000

environmental regulations

in our opinion compliance with federal state and local environmental
protection regulations does not and will not have a material effect on our
capital expenditures earnings and competitive position

fiscal years ended april 1 2001 april 2 2000 and march 28 1999

sales sales increased 457 to 2716 million in fiscal 2001 from 1864
million in fiscal 2000 the increase is principally the result of high growth
experienced by our semiconductor and ceramic products segments during the first
nine months of fiscal 2001 as demand for wireless and broadband products
increased during this period during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a
downturn in the wireless and broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly
sales reducing the overall increase in sales during fiscal 2001 when compared
to fiscal 2000 sales increased 475 to 1864 million in fiscal 2000 from
1264 million in fiscal 1999 the increase was primarily attributable to
increased demand for wireless products as well as demand for products in
emerging broadband data applications sales of products for the defense market
decreased to 65 of total sales in fiscal 2001 from 77 in fiscal 2000 and
172 in 1999 as we continue to exit the defense market by offering last time
buys to our customers and concluding existing contracts deliveries to motorola
represented 260 of our total sales in fiscal 2001 compared to 341 in fiscal
2000 and 281 in fiscal 1999 deliveries to ericsson represented 113 of our
total sales in fiscal 2001 and represented less than 10 of our total sales in
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999

gross profit gross profit increased 484 to 1199 million in fiscal 2001 from
808 million in fiscal 2000 gross margin increased to 442 in fiscal 2001
from 434 in fiscal 2000 these increases were primarily attributable to our
continued ability to leverage capacity and improve operating efficiencies in
both our semiconductor and ceramic products segments during the first nine
months of fiscal 2001 offset by the effect of high fixed costs on lower sales
experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 gross profit increased 466
to 808 million in fiscal 2000 from 551 million in fiscal 1999 the increase
in gross profit was primarily a result of increased sales as well as improved
operating efficiencies in our semiconductor and ceramic products segments as
both continued to leverage capacity and improve yields gross margin decreased
slightly to 434 in fiscal 2000 from 436 in fiscal 1999 the slight decrease
in gross margin was attributable to our acquisition of ndi on april 24 2000
ndi experienced a negative gross margin during fiscal 2000 as it initiated a
ramp in production during this period without the offsetting sales volume

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased
422 to 360 million or 133 of sales in fiscal 2001 from 253 million or
136 of sales in fiscal 2000 the increase in research and development expenses
is primarily attributable to our ongoing development of processes and
applications within our semiconductor products segment in order to address our
targeted markets wireless and broadband more than 90 of our total research
and development spending in fiscal 2001 was within the semiconductor products
segment research and development expenses increased 589 to 253 million or
136 of sales in fiscal 2000 from 159 million or 126 of sales in fiscal
1999 the increase in research and development expenses was primarily
attributable to the development of processes and applications in the
semiconductor products segment

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses
increased 268 to 433 million or 159 of sales in fiscal 2001 from 341
million or 183 of sales in fiscal 2000 included in the 433 million is
approximately 18 million in onetime transaction costs associated with the
acquisition of ndi on april 24 2000 excluding these onetime costs selling
and administrative expenses for fiscal 2001 would have totaled 415 million or
153 of sales an increase of 216 compared to fiscal 2000 the increase in
selling and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased
direct selling costs resulting from higher sales volumes as well as increased
costs related to training and recruiting employees due to our continued ability
to support our sales growth without incurring substantial additional costs
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal
2001 when compared to fiscal 2000

selling and administrative expenses increased 437 to 341 million or 183 of
sales in fiscal 2000 from 237 million or 188 of sales in fiscal 1999 the
increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to increased
sales commissions and direct selling costs resulting from higher sales volumes
as well as increased expenses related to training recruiting and an increased
sales force as a result of our ability to support our sales growth without
incurring substantial additional costs selling and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999

other income net other income net increased 471 to 86 million or 32 of
sales in fiscal 2001 from 59 million or 31 of sales in fiscal 2000 the
increase in other income net was primarily attributable to an increase in
interest income as a result of higher average levels of cash cash equivalents
and shortterm investments other income net more than quadrupled to 59
million or 31 of sales in fiscal 2000 from 12 million or 10 of sales in
fiscal 1999 the increase was also primarily the result of considerably higher
levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments

provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes in fiscal
2001 was 159 million compared to 93 million in fiscal 2000 the fiscal 2001
provision reflects a tax rate of approximately 32 compared to a tax rate of 34
in fiscal 2000 the decrease in the fiscal 2001 tax rate is primarily the result
of research and development tax credits utilized in fiscal 2001 the 26
million benefit reflected in fiscal 1999 reflects a 10 tax rate offset by a
33 million tax benefit the tax benefit of 33 million resulted from a
reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because of the
expected use of net operating loss carryforwards in future periods

semiconductor products sales for the semiconductor products segment increased
494 to 2246 million in fiscal 2001 from 1503 million in fiscal 2000 the
increase was primarily attributable to increased demand and penetration into our
two targeted markets wireless communications and broadband during the first
nine months of fiscal 2001 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a downturn
in the wireless and broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales
reducing the overall increase in sales during fiscal 2001 sales for the
semiconductor products segment increased 490 to 1503 million in fiscal 2000
from 1009 million in fiscal 1999 the increase reflects a growing wireless
market to include data increased market penetration and gains in market share

operating income for the semiconductor products segment increased 998 to 335
million in fiscal 2001 from 168 million in fiscal 2000 included in the 335
million is approximately 18 million in onetime transaction costs associated
with the acquisition of ndi excluding these onetime costs operating income

for fiscal 2001 would have totaled 353 million an increase of 1105 when
compared to fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to increased
sales and improved operating efficiencies as this segment continued to leverage
capacity improve yields and control selling and administrative costs operating
income for the semiconductor products segment increased 234 to 168 million
in fiscal 2000 from 136 million in fiscal 1999 the increase was primarily
attributable to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as this
segment continued to leverage capacity and control material costs additionally
as this segment continued its development of processes and applications for the
wireless and broadband markets it was able to control administrative costs

ceramic products sales for the ceramic products segment increased 304 to
470 million in fiscal 2001 from 361 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was
primarily due to growth in demand and increased penetration in the wireless
infrastructure and broadband markets for the first nine months of fiscal 2001
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 a downturn in the wireless and
broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales reducing the overall
increase in sales during fiscal 2001 sales for the ceramic products segment
increased 412 to 361 million in fiscal 2000 from 255 million in fiscal
1999 the increase in sales was primarily attributable to growth in wireless
infrastructure combined with added customer penetration as well as an
increasing demand from emerging broadband customers

operating income for the ceramic products segment increased 547 to 72
million in fiscal 2001 from 46 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in
operating income was primarily the result of increased sales and improved
operating efficiencies including the leveraging of existing capacity and the
investment in more costeffective equipment operating income for the ceramic
products segment more than doubled to 46 million in fiscal 2000 from 19
million in fiscal 1999 the increase in operating income was primarily
attributable to an increase in sales and improved operating efficiencies
including the leveraging of capacity and increased manufacturing automation

liquidity and capital resources

as of april 1 2001 we had working capital of 1883 million including 1538
million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in fiscal 2001
operations generated 576 million of cash primarily attributable to net income
of 334 million in addition we effectively managed working capital as
evidenced by an increase in average annual inventory turns to 110 in fiscal
2001 compared to 102 in fiscal 2000 and by a decrease in average annual days
sales outstanding to 48 days in fiscal 2001 compared to 56 days in fiscal 2000

capital expenditures during fiscal 2001 totaled 547 million of the 547
million approximately 484 million was related to the semiconductor products
segment as we continued our investment in the semiconductor gaas wafer
fabrication operation and the integrated circuit and discrete semiconductor
assembly and test areas of the 484 million 123 million relates to the
purchase of a 125000 square foot facility in haverhill massachusetts this
facility was purchased in september 2000 and provides additional manufacturing
and office space initial operations at this site commenced in january 2001 and
include design engineering as well as gaas ic silicon semiconductor and
multichip module assembly and testing the relocation of these operations to
the haverhill facility has provided additional space for the expansion of
fabrication operations at our facility in woburn massachusetts

in september 1999 we announced the completion of the first phase of a major
expansion program to enhance and expand the available clean room space in our
gaas ic facility in woburn massachusetts the new clean room space is complete
and in use and additional manufacturing equipment has been installed and
brought to full operation the second phase which involved the installation of
additional production equipment within the existing facility has been
completed the third phase of the expansion program involves the creation of a
gaas ic line that will allow the manufacture of product on sixinch wafers we
are in the initial stages of development of this sixinch wafer production line
which we estimate will cost approximately 30 million dollars we expect to
complete this phase within twelve to fifteen months once


                                       15

alpha industries inc and subsidiaries


this new sixinch wafer production line is in operation we plan to convert our
existing fourinch wafer production areas to sixinch as future demand
requires improvements in manufacturing capabilities at our ceramics facilities
accounted for approximately 63 million of capital expenditures

in november 2000 we extended our 10 million revolving credit agreement through
november 15 2002 the revolving credit agreement had an initial expiration date
of october 31 2000 there were no borrowings under this agreement at april 1
2001 we expect to continue to maintain a debt facility upon expiration of the
existing credit agreement

in june 1999 we completed a public offering of our common stock that raised net
proceeds of 1094 million substantially all of the proceeds were invested in
commercial paper and securities issued by various federal agencies and
corporations the net proceeds may be used for the purchase of equipment the
expansion of facilities and the acquisition of businesses technologies or
products that complement our business

on april 24 2000 we announced the completion of our acquisition of
privatelyheld network device inc based in sunnyvale california
approximately 267 million shares of common stock of the company were exchanged
for all outstanding shares of ndi approximately 185000 shares of company stock
were reserved for the conversion of ndi stock options into company options the
acquisition has been accounted for as a poolingofinterests

we believe that anticipated cash from operations available funds and borrowings
under our revolving credit agreement together with the net proceeds from our
fiscal 1999 stock offering will be adequate to fund our currently planned
working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through fiscal
2002

other matters

inflation did not have a significant impact upon our results of operations
during the threeyear period ended april 1 2001

on april 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
instruments and sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments
and certain hedging activities an amendment to sfas no 133 the adoption of
these statements had no material effect on our consolidated financial position
results of operations or cash flows

forwardlooking statements

this report and other documents we have filed with the securities and exchange
commission contain forwardlooking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
forwardlooking statements represent our judgment regarding future events
although we would not make forwardlooking statements unless we believe we have
a reasonable basis for doing so we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual
results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of
uncertainties we urge you to consider the risks and uncertainties discussed
below and elsewhere in this report and in the other documents filed with the sec
in evaluating our forwardlooking statements we have no plans to update our
forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this report we generally identify forwardlooking statements with the words

current market conditions make it especially difficult to predict operating
results our operating results have been materially and adversely affected in
the past by the failure of anticipated orders to be realized and by deferrals
and cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements
current market conditions make predictions of future operations particularly
difficult these factors include but are not limited to the following
         significant variations in and unpredictability of customer orders
         more frequent customer requests for order cancellations and deferrals
         customers inability to make accurate forecasts or predictions of
          their future requirements and
         customers increased efforts to minimize their inventories and attain
          justintime delivery

our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations a significant
portion of our sales in each fiscal period has been concentrated among a limited
number of customers if we lost one or more of these major customers or if one
or more major customers significantly decreases its orders our business would
be materially and adversely affected in fiscal 2001 sales to our five largest
customers accounted for 529 of our sales with motorola and ericsson
accounting for 260 and 113 of sales respectively our future operating
results depend on the success of these customers and our success in selling
products to them

our sales volume is affected by our oem customers sales volume a substantial
portion of our sales is derived from sales of products to oems these oems
demand highly reliable products and often require up to several months to
evaluate and test our integrated circuits and devices before deciding to design
them into their products if our products are designed into an oems product
our sales volume will depend upon the commercial success and the length and
timing of the product cycle of the oems product we are also subject to sales
variations arising from our oem customers inventory management our operating
results have been materially affected and will probably be affected in the
future by unexpected changes in our oem customers order patterns

difficulties in production would adversely affect our operating results our
products are very complex have sophisticated designs and are manufactured using
complex process technologies difficulties in production can occur which would
limit our ability to ship product and adversely affect our operating results in
most cases our products are customized for our customers who insist that our
products meet their exact specifications for quality performance and
reliability if we are unable to manufacture to our customers specifications
our operating results will suffer

our operating results are dependent on the development of new products and on
our ability to increase product revenue per platform our future success will
depend on our ability to develop new products in a timely and costeffective
manner and on our continued ability to increase product revenue per platform
the development of our new products is highly complex we have sometimes
experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new
products the successful development and introduction of new products depends on
a number of factors including our timely completion of product designs and
development our ability to develop manufacturing processes for new products
and commercial acceptance of our new products and enhancements

our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the wireless and
broadband communications industry would impair our growth the wireless and
broadband communications markets are characterized by frequent introductions of
new products services and protocols new products services and protocols
respond to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for
greater functionality lower costs smaller products and better performance as
a result we have experienced and will continue to experience product design
obsolescence we must continue to improve our product designs and develop new
products with new technologies to meet our customers demands

we operate in very competitive industries and we may be unable to compete
successfully competition in the markets for our products is intense we compete
with several companies primarily


                                       17
page   18
alpha industries inc and subsidiaries


engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling integrated
circuits discrete semiconductors and ceramic products as well as suppliers of
other discrete products for example we compete with our largest customer in
the production of power amplifiers our competitors could develop new process
technologies that may be superior to ours in addition many of our existing and
potential customers manufacture or assemble wireless communications devices and
have substantial inhouse technological capabilities if one of our large
customers decided to design and manufacture integrated circuits internally it
could have an adverse effect on our operating results

many of our existing and potential competitors have strong market positions
considerable internal manufacturing capacity established intellectual property
rights and substantial technological capabilities moreover a number of our
existing and potential competitors have greater financial technical
manufacturing and marketing resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to compete successfully with our competitors

we expect competition to increase this could mean lower prices for our products
or reduced demand for our products any of these developments would have an
adverse effect on our operating results

average selling prices for our products typically decline over time average
selling prices for our products decline over time many of our manufacturing
costs are fixed for a given level of sales when our manufacturing costs
decline our gross margins improve and when our manufacturing costs increase
our gross margins decline our operating results suffer when gross margins
decline we may experience these problems in the future and we cannot predict
when they may occur or their severity

our operating results would suffer if one of our key suppliers fails to deliver
materials or services for the fabrication of our products we obtain certain
materials and services for our products from one or a limited number of
suppliers for example we procure gaas substrates a critical raw material
from a small number of suppliers in addition we obtain some gaas wafers from a
single external foundry and we buy silicon substrates for semiconductors and
certain chemical powders for ceramic manufacturing from single sources we
purchase these materials and services on a purchase order basis we do not carry
significant inventories and have longterm supply contracts with only a limited
number of our vendors our inability to obtain critical materials or services in
required quantities or in acceptable quality would result in significant delays
or reductions in product shipments this would materially and adversely affect
our operating results

our operating results may fluctuate significantly our quarterly and annual
sales earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the
past and may fluctuate significantly in the future primarily as a result of
variations in our customers orders and the potential for delay or deferral of
customer implementation of our technology into their products

the benefits of our gaas products compared to silicon alternatives may not
continue the production of gaas integrated circuits is more costly than the
production of silicon circuits as a result we must offer gaas products that
provide superior performance to that of silicon for specific applications to be
competitive with silicon products if we do not continue to offer products that
provide sufficiently superior performance to offset the cost differential our
operating results may be materially and adversely affected we believe our costs
of producing gaas integrated circuits will continue to exceed the costs
associated with the production of silicon circuits the costs differ because of
higher costs of raw materials for gaas lower production yields in gaas
technology and higher unit costs associated with lower production volumes
silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for
certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in
performance we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and
markets that require performance superior to that offered by silicon solutions

we face significant challenges managing our growth we have experienced periods
of significant growth and expect to do so in the future to manage our growth
effectively we must continue to


                                       18
page   19
                                         alpha industries inc and subsidiaries


         improve operational systems
         maintain adequate physical plant manufacturing facilities and
          equipment to meet customer demand
         add experienced senior level managers and
         attract and retain qualified people with experience in engineering
          design and manufacturing

we will spend substantial amounts of money in connection with our growth and may
have additional unexpected costs our manufacturing equipment may not be
adequate to support rapid increases in orders for our products and we may not
be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities if
we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively our business
operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected

there may be unanticipated costs associated with increasing our capacity we
anticipate that any future growth of our business will require increased
manufacturing capacity in response to this need we have begun the
implementation of a conversion of our woburn massachusetts gaas ic fabrication
facility that will allow the manufacture of product on sixinch wafers we also
purchased a 125000 square foot facility in haverhill massachusetts which
provides additional manufacturing and office space for our massachusetts
operations we may be required to purchase significant additional equipment or
further expand our facilities in the future expansion activities such as these
are subject to a number of risks including

         unavailability or late delivery of the advanced and often customized
          equipment used in the production of our products
         delays in bringing new production equipment online
         work stoppages and delays in supplying products for our existing
          customers during expansion activities and
         unforeseen environmental or engineering problems relating to existing
          or new facilities

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of our present
expansion or any future expansion of our capacity

our international sales could decline as a result of currency exchange
fluctuations and other factors our sales outside of the united states were
approximately 1337 million in fiscal 2001 848 million in fiscal 2000 and
458 million in fiscal 1999 because most of our foreign sales are denominated
in united states dollars our products particularly our ceramic products
become less price competitive with products manufactured by competitors based in
countries whose currencies decline in value against the dollar international
sales involve a number of additional risks including

         imposition of government controls
         potential insolvency of international distributors and
          representatives
         fluctuation of economies outside the united states
         political instability outside the united states
         generally longer receivables collection periods for foreign customers
          and
         tariffs and other trade barriers

in addition due to the technological advantage provided by gaas in many
military applications a portion of our sales outside of north america are
subject to export controls although we have not experienced any difficulty in
obtaining necessary export licenses failure to obtain such licenses in the
future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

our compliance with environmental regulations may be costly we are subject to a
variety of federal state and local requirements governing the protection of the
environment these requirements relate to the use storage handling discharge
and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing
processes we may incur significant expense in complying with these
requirements and these requirements may become more stringent in the future in
the past compliance with environmental


                                       19

alpha industries inc and subsidiaries


regulations and our response to environmental claims and litigation has been
costly failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to
substantial liability or force us to change our manufacturing operations in
addition under some of these regulations we could be held financially
responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated even if we
did not cause the contamination

we may have difficulty in protecting our intellectual property our ability to
compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property a
significant aspect of our intellectual property is our product and process
technology we rely primarily on trade secret laws confidentiality procedures
and licensing arrangements to protect our trade secrets and intellectual
property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may
be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our trade secrets or
intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united
states this may make the possibility of misappropriation of our technology and
trade secrets more likely we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to
protect our trade secrets and intellectual property will be adequate to prevent
misappropriation of our technology

our operations could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others
aspects of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual
property rights or patents of others other companies may hold or obtain patents
on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary
to our business we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to
seek licenses we cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be
required to seek will be reasonable

we may have difficulty in managing and integrating acquisitions from time to
time we explore opportunities to acquire businesses to expand our production
capacity and our product offerings such as our acquisition of ndi acquisitions
involve numerous risks including

         difficulties in integrating operations products and corporate
          cultures
         difficulties in completing the development of acquired technologies
         difficulties in managing different geographic units
         entering markets or businesses in which we have limited experience
          and
         the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses

moreover any delay or failure to integrate an acquired company technology or
product line could result in the additional expenditure of money and in
increased demands on our managements time these expenditures and demands could
have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results
of operations acquisitions may involve expending significant funds and the
issuance of additional securities which may be dilutive to stockholders



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of shortterm
investments and financial instruments caused by fluctuations in investment
prices and interest rates

investment price risk
the fair value of the companys shortterm investment portfolio at april 1
2001 approximated carrying value due to its shortterm duration market risk
estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical
10 decrease in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment
portfolio is not considered to be material because of the shortterm nature of
the investments

interest rate risk
the carrying value of the companys longterm debt including current
maturities was 235000 at april 1 2001 due to the nature of the debt
instruments management has determined that the fair value was not materially
different from the yearend carrying value
