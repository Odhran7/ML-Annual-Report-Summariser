revenues

the following chart shows our 2020 revenues by service type

 

the expeditors network

beginning in 1981 expeditors’ primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s we began to expand our service capabilities in airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today expeditors has approximately 17500 employees and provides a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise we plan to

open new offices while expeditors has historically expanded through organic growth we have also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

at january 31 2021 expeditors including its majorityowned subsidiaries is organized functionally in geographic operating segments and operates district offices in the regions identified below our district offices have been established in locations where expeditors maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock

expeditors operates 176 district offices in the following geographic areas of responsibility











we also maintain branch offices which are aligned with and dependent on one district office additionally we contract with independent agents to provide required services and have established 38 such relationships worldwide

our strategy

expeditor’s strategic plan is to achieve longterm sustainable and profitable growth by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers our teams are aligned on the specific markets of these focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in 2020 in light of recent market disruptions including the impact of the covid19 we reviewed and refreshed our strategy to focus on four key strategic initiatives going forward









our chief strategy officer continues to oversee all strategy within expeditors with a deep focus on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansion

global logistics and supply chain technology

expeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize a single enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate security disaster recovery and high availability

expeditors’ technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing maintaining and enhancing technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functions

we are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers we continuously monitor emerging technologies for potential applicability to our business expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics creates greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly important we are continually enhancing our systems including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems

organic versus acquired growth 

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition however when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage or specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network in may 2020 we acquired a lessthantruckload digital online shipping platform that aligns with our focus on enhancing our digital solutions 

tailored solutions

as a nonasset based logistics services provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions by understanding a customers logistics and supply chain processes strategies and objectives we identify targeted areas of opportunity for improvement and deploy the right services and solutions for that customer these services include our core offerings of transportation customs clearance warehousing and distribution and order management along with expertise in supply chain analysis and optimization trade compliance consulting cargo insurance cargo security and solutions for oversized and heavylift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operational processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliance while focusing on the individual needs of each customer 

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our sales strategies and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our sales strategies at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retention

leveraging global regional and local expertise

at expeditors we create strategy process technology and compliance programs at the corporate level in order to drive consistency across all levels of the organization we leverage regional and local expertise by staffing our districts principally with local managers and personnel who are from the regions in which they operate and who have extensive experience in logistics coupled with a deep understanding of their local market district offices are responsible for selling and executing expeditors services directly to customers and prospects and are involved in the selection of logistics service providers in addition to ensuring that customers receive timely and effective services defining our strategy at a global level while executing it at a regional and local level with customized supply chain solutions enables us to drive consistency and efficiency we believe that focus on hiring and developing a diverse and talented workforce with an emphasis on exceptional customer service along with our incentivebased compensation program enables us to provide exceptional service and superior financial results

what expeditors ships

the goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination these goods include products from multiple industries including electronics high technology healthcare aerospace and aviation manufacturing oil and energy automotive retail and fashion in order to meet customers complex and industryspecific demands we utilize industry vertical teams throughout our network that focus on providing tailored solutions to different industries industry vertical teams work closely with our regional and district resources to grow our business no single customer accounts for five percent or more of our revenues

expeditors services in detail

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services

airfreight services

airfreight services accounted for approximately 47 36 and 40 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo capacity from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with securing capacity during periods of high demand

in our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors 

7

 

agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

we estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both

at the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within 48 hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand available cargo capacity from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demand in 2020 as a result of the decline in passenger aircraft capacity availability we have greatly increased our usage of chartered aircrafts we expect to continue to utilize charted aircrafts until such time as passenger air traffic returns to historic levels

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained directly from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment

our airfreight revenues less directly related costs of transportation and other expenses for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge our customers for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses exposure to volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service

many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt and incurred historic operating losses in 2020 as a result carriers are facing liquidity challenges exacerbated by the global pandemic and are seeking relief under various government support programs in particular air carriers are experiencing significant cash flow challenges as a result of passenger flights cancellations uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel compared to prepandemic levels may impact air carriers’ operations and financial stability long term th is environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize carriers financial results will continue to drive their asset acquisition and deployment strategies which will impact airfreight pricing and capacity most of expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible certain customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping changes in available capacity periods of high demand or other market disruptions could impact our buy and sell rates and challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

ocean freight and ocean services

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23 27 and 28 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management

ocean freight consolidation  as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of 

8

 

shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export and import laws 

direct ocean forwarding  when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management  order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management delivery management and ordersku visibility through our webbased portal customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates required delivery dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization document creation and visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via our webbased portal order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

prior to 2020 many ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses and are still highly leveraged with debt multiple carrier acquisitions and alliances have occurred and certain carriers are entering into traditional freight forwarding services as they pursue scale and additional market share in an effort to improve profitability ocean carriers have improved their management of capacity relative to demand in recent years currently demand exceeds capacity in certain lanes demand for ocean transportation increased sharply in the second half of 2020 resulting in severe ports congestion in particular on transpacific lanes this has created new operational challenges for carriers including their ability to maintain sailing schedules carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

expeditors’ pricing is based on contract negotiations each year with our global carrier partners our pricing model is flexible we purchase based on customer needs and our carrier strategy determines our volume and pricing commitments fixed pricing arrangements are entered into for a portion of our forecasted commitments while spot market pricing arrangements are typically negotiated at the regional and local levels

we offer our customers a wide carrier footprint globally to meet their changing needs with fewer global carriers than in the past maintaining close relationships with our carrier partners allows us to meet our customers’ space requirements throughout the year including during peak periods

customs brokerage and other services

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 30 37 and 32 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as a customs broker we assist our customers in clearing shipments through customs by preparing and transmitting required information and documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging required inspections by governmental agencies and providing delivery services we provide customs brokerage services in conjunction with transportation services or independently expeditors supports regulatory compliance and visibility to the supply chain through process and system controls technology and oversight by licensed and trained professionals we offer a customized solutionsbased approach to our customers based on the complexity of their business our pricing reflects this complexity and scope in addition to the number of declarations filed

we also provide other value added services within our network such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and industryspecific valueadded services our warehousing services are offered primarily in leased facilities utilized by multiple customers customers benefit from cost savings related to space labor equipment and other efficiencies delivered in a transactional pricing model expeditors transcon consists of multimodal intracontinental ground transportation and delivery services and includes valueadded white glove and timedefinite services expeditors responds to customerdriven requests for trade compliance consulting services primarily through tradewin fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects

human capital 

opportunities for employees and positive work environment

expeditors’ most important asset is its employees the cornerstone of our company culture is the professional growth and development of our employees from the inception of our company management has inherently understood that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining knowledgeable and experienced personnel we believe that our greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture that requires

















we believe in creating and maintaining a positive work environment for employees that commitment is supported by policies designed to promote fairness and equitable treatment and our supervisors and managers are charged with the responsibility of setting positive examples and providing mentoring with a focus on the importance of compliance we promote equal employment opportunity and have policies that expressly prohibit unacceptable behaviors including harassment intimidation or discrimination of any kind based on race sex sexual orientation gender identity gender expression marital status age color religion creed national origin disability veteran status or any other characteristic protected under applicable law

to protect our employees we are committed to maintaining secure business operations globally by following our wellestablished security standards maintained and deployed by our health and safety team as well as applicable health and safety laws and regulation we have mechanisms in place to report accidents injuries and unsafe working conditions

as a knowledgebased organization we focus on employees’ professional development through regular performance reviews and training including mandatory trainings related to compliance ethics health and security specific certifications where required to perform certain duties supervising skills and development of succession plans of key employees 

compensation and retention

we reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this incentivebased compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key employee can earn for success we believe in a “real world” environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance sound business decisions accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a career to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees we place considerable emphasis on our incentive based compensation programs

since our business is servicebased we believe that employee retention remains critical to our longterm success to that end and true to our company culture we have traditionally not laid off employees when we have encountered challenging downturns or economic uncertainty for example in 20082009 the last time we witnessed a significant downturn in our industry we adopted a “no lay off” policy because we knew business would come back at some point in the future and that we would need these employees to execute and grow our business looking back on that decision we know it was the right thing to do for both our employees and our business during that time we redeployed employees to analyze and improve our operational processes and work on strategic projects in 2020 during the early stages of the pandemic we again adopted a “no lay off” policy for many of the same reasons as in 20082009

10

 

we evaluate our ability to engage and retain employees by monitoring turnover rates percentage of positions filled internally and by regularly conducting employee satisfaction surveys to identify opportunities where we can improve  

geographically diverse workforce

at december 31 2020 expeditors employed approximately 17500 people of which approximately 11300 were employed in international locations we believe that focus on hiring and developing a diverse and talented workforce coupled with our incentivebased compensation program enables us to provide exceptional service and superior financial results we need to leverage regional and local expertise by staffing our districts principally with local managers and personnel who are from the regions in which they operate and who have extensive experience in logistics coupled with a deep understanding of their local market this results in a highly talented inclusive and multicultural global workforce that reflects the diverse regions that we serve because our business involves shipments between districts and typically touches more than one geographic area our success requires a high degree of communication and cooperation among our employees globally district managers are key individuals in our company as sales operational execution and business and expenditure decisions necessary to service our customers are the responsibility of management at each district the vast majority of our employees are based in our operational districts geographically distributed as shown below we have summarized the number of employees based on individual headcount as of december 31 2020 as follows

 



 

competition

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited certain ocean carriers are entering into traditional freight forwarding services as they pursue scale and additional market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry some of our competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong presence in certain markets

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service underscored by a strong commitment to compliance and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry

larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics and supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities is a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi and application program interfaces api online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimization

furthermore covid19 has had a profound impact on a large number of customers across different industries and many companies are now exploring options to build a strategy around supply chain resiliency agility sourcing and inventory optimization

11

 

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated supply chain requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of technology and digital solutions in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we compete 

unlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting systems running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions

our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units revenues and operating income available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage

currency and dependence on service providers

our worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agents

in addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of the effect of the pandemic ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways

seasonality

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal demand trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future or to what degree it will continue to be impacted by the pandemic this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions pandemics governmental policies and intergovernmental disputes and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods

business operations

we do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license

the continuing global threats from pandemics terrorism cyberattacks smuggling and wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries have resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to tighten border controls and minimize the exposure of their citizens to contagious diseases criminal elements and potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our services

environmental

in the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although our current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business

while government regulation related to climate change is under consideration by various level of governments internationally and in the united states expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the impact of our operations on the environment and assisting our

customers in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint  we have employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 1 emissions include all direct greenhouse gas emissions scope 2 includes indirect greenhouse gas emission from purchased electricity heat or steam we have voluntarily disclosed our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data to cdp since 2010  w e are also attentive to our scope 3 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain therefore we are currently a member of both smartway and transporte limpio in north america smartway is a voluntary publicprivate program sponsored by the epa for tracking documenting and sharing information about fuel use and freight emissions across supply chains transporte limpio is a similar voluntary program sponsored by the mexican government 

cargo liability

when acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 22 s pecial d rawing r ights sdrs per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent generally when acting solely as the agent of the shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the carrier

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally between 500 and 667 sdrs per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally between 050 per pound and 833 sdrs per kilo although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent

when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track

in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2020 was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers

 item 1a – risk factors

 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations in future periods the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in future periods

covid19 risks

 

covid19 significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and global trade and may continue to have a disruptive effect on our operations and the operations of our service providers and our customers which may further impact our business

 

covid19 was declared as a global health emergency and later declared as a global pandemic by the world health organization as a result throughout 2020 governments have implemented travel restrictions mandated lockdowns and other precautionary measures that resulted in significant business and supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in international trade this crisis has affected and is expected to continue affecting our business in many aspects governments have designated our operations as essential business and we activated our business continuity plan to be able to conduct operations our facilities and employees are operating under the constraints of special protective measures and many are working remotely these disruptions are also threatening the financial stability of our service providers and the ability to efficiently and profitably route our customers’ freight reduced flight schedules and cancellations have significantly reduced available space for airfreight while ocean carriers have continued to manage their operating capacity certain freight lanes have presented severe shortages of capacity compared to demand at various times over the year while ocean ports congestion in the second half of the year also hampered the routing of freight these freight market conditions have created and continue to create pricing volatility that challenges expeditors’ ability to maintain historical unitary profitability many of our customers are experiencing disruptions in their revenue and cash flow prompting these customers to renegotiate contractual terms and increasing our accounts receivable collection risks such conditions could result in the loss of business and additional bad debt allowances in the future if our customers’ ability to pay deteriorates although we are monitoring the situation we cannot predict for how long or the ultimate extent to which the pandemic and related precautionary measures may disrupt our operations any significant disruption resulting from this on a large scale or over an extended period of time would negatively affect our business and our financial results  the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below 

 

we rely on service providers such as air ocean and ground freight carriers and if they become financially unstable or have reduced capacity to provide service because of covid19 it may adversely impact our business and operating results

 

as a nonasset based provider of global logistics services expeditors depends on a variety of assetbased service providers including air ocean and ground freight carriers the quality and profitability of our services depend upon effective selection and oversight of our service providers covid19 places significant stress on our air ocean and freight ground carriers which may continue to result in reduced carrier capacity or availability pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules which could adversely impact our operations and financial results during the pandemic air carriers have been particularly affected having to cancel flights due to travel restrictions resulting in dramatic drops in revenues historical losses and liquidity challenges uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel in particular business travel to prepandemic levels means air carriers’ operations and financial stability may be adversely affected long term prior to 2020 ocean carriers have incurred significant operating losses are still highly leveraged with debt additionally several ocean carriers have consolidated with the potential for more to occur in the future

 

the global economic recession has impacted trade and could affect demand for our services or the financial stability of our service providers and customers

 

the global economy has entered a recession as a result of the pandemic which has affected trade and could affect demand for our services continued unfavorable economic conditions could result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect expeditors revenues operating results and cash flows these conditions should they continue for extended period of time would further adversely affect our customers and service providers should our customers’ ability to pay deteriorate additional bad debts may be incurred

 

industry risks

 

any reduction in international commerce or disruption in global trade may adversely impact our business and operating results

 

expeditors primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract our primary market and adversely impact our operating results for example international trade is influenced by





















 

16

 

 

our industry is highly competitive and failure to compete or respond to customer requirements could damage our business and results of operations

 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited nevertheless many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors and are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and are developing new technologies to gain competitive advantages depending on the location of the shipper and the importer we must compete against both the niche players larger entities including carriers and emerging technology companies the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service and to secure favorable pricing and contractual terms such as longer payment terms fixedprice arrangements higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations cash flows and financial condition

 

operational risks

 

we are dependent on our personnel and any inability to develop or retain our key employees may have a negative impact on our operations

 

identifying training and retaining employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability effective succession planning is an important element of our programs failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business by hindering our ability to execute our business strategies and impacting our level of service we must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning

 

we believe that our compensation programs which have been in place since we became a publicly traded entity are among the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating our performance from that of many of our competitors significant changes to compensation programs or significant declines in our operating income or operating losses could impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel

 

the global pandemic has caused disruptions to our work environment by requiring the majority of employees to work remotely we cannot predict how this may affect employees’ habits preferences nor the impact it may have on our company’s culture and our ability to continue to retain and attract talented employees who have become accustomed to a remote work environment

 

we rely heavily upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies used in our core business and failure to properly manage such technologies could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive

 

expeditors relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing our core businesses future results depend on our success in developing competitive and reliable systems to address the needs of our customers and suppliers development and maintenance of these systems must be accomplished in a costeffective manner and support the use of secure protocols including integration and availability of third party technology we are continually enhancing our systems including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems these efforts are inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive

 

any significant disruptions to our network and systems continuity could have an adverse impact to our business and financial results

 

as expeditors our customers and suppliers continue to increase reliance on systems and as additional features are added the risks also increase any significant disruptions to our global systems or the internet for any reason which could include equipment or network failures colocation facility failures power outages sabotage employee error or other actions cyberattacks or other security breaches reliance on third party technology geopolitical activity or natural disasters all of which could have a material negative effect on our results this could include loss of revenue business disruptions such as the inability to timely process shipments loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information legal claims and proceedings reporting delays or errors interference with regulatory reporting significant remediation costs an increase in costs to protect our systems and technology or damage to our reputation

 

we rely on our service providers such as air ocean and ground freight carriers and as they are experiencing increases in operating costs it may impact our profitability

 

expeditors carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the transportation industry which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs on to our customers our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 

changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers and capacity allotment made available to expeditors by assetbased carriers affects us in unpredictable ways any combination of reduced carrier capacity or availability pricing volatility 

17

 

or more limited carrier transportation schedules such as those caused by the pandemic could further negatively affect our ability to execute services and maintain profitability expeditors cannot predict whether relief measures extended by certain governments will be effective in supporting the financial viability of carriers nor can we predict the longterm effects of this crisis on carriers’ financial stability and ability to provide services  

 

failure to grow and gain profitable market share could adversely impact our ability to remain competitive and could adversely impact our business

 

expeditors has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition future results will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations to continue to grow organically we must gain profitable market share in a highly competitive environment and successfully develop and market new service offerings when investment opportunities arise our success could be dependent on our ability to evaluate and integrate acquisitions

 

any disruption of our business caused by a catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and impact our operating results

 

a disruption or failure of expeditors systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest mass population dislocations pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters and certain other critical business operations are in the seattle washington area which is near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results

 

difficulty in forecasting timing or volumes of customer shipments or rate changes by carriers could adversely impact our margins and operating results

 

expeditors is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting shortterm customer requirements however longterm customer satisfaction depends upon our ability to meet these unpredictable shortterm customer requirements personnel costs our single largest expense are always less flexible in the very near term as we must staff to meet uncertain demand as a result shortterm operating results could be disproportionately affected

 

a significant portion of expeditors revenues is derived from customers in retail and technology industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of our revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of our control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods changes in trade tariffs product launches andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore we may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our stock

 

volatile market conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advance notice we often cannot pass these rate increases on to our customers in the same time frame if at all as a result our yields and margins can be negatively impacted as recently experienced

 

government regulation and tax risks

 

we are subject to a complex regulatory environment and failure to comply with and adapt to these regulations could result in penalties or otherwise adversely impact our business

 

expeditors is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which we operate many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation including those related to handling dangerous and hazardous materials trade compliance data privacy environmental employment compensation and competition and may result in unforeseen costs

 

in reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations these regulations are multilayered increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements among various governmental authorities furthermore the implementation of these regulations including deadlines and substantive requirements can be driven by regulatory urgencies rather than industrys realistic ability to comply

 

failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations or the failure breach or compromise of our policies and procedures or those of our service providers or agents may result in increased operating costs damage to our reputation difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel restrictions on operations or fines and penalties

18

 

in 2020 t he united kingdom and the european union negotiat ed the terms of the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu which were effective on january 1 2021  these rules and regulations are in the process of being implemented and are subject to further interpretation and change the full impact of the united kingdom’s departure and impact to international trade is still uncertain 

 

we operate globally and any inability to safeguard our operations or comply with anticorruption laws would adversely impact our reputation and business

 

the majority of expeditors revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states to maintain a global service network we may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises

 

in addition we operate in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws rules regulations and decrees of the united states and of other countries in which we conduct business including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act as well as trade and exchange control laws or laws regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions and antiboycott laws and regulations compliance with these laws rules regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees service providers agents third party brokers and customers whose individual actions could violate these laws rules regulations and decrees failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses damage to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business

 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any adverse determinations in tax audits could negatively impact our financial results

 

expeditors is subject to taxation in the united states federal state and local as well as many foreign jurisdictions including the people’s republic of china including hong kong taiwan vietnam india mexico canada netherlands and the united kingdom in many of these jurisdictions the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules including interpretations of those rules the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations can be highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts recorded 

 

it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and possibly may reach resolution related to income tax examinations covering one or more jurisdictions and years in december 2017 the united states made significant changes to its tax laws still subject to issuance of new regulations and interpretation which added complexity and uncertainty in calculating corporate tax liabilities we are regularly under audit by tax authorities including transfer pricing inquiries although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits including any potential penalties and interest could be materially different from our tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact our financial results 

 

current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change changes in tax laws or statutory tax rates competing tax regimes variability in the mix of pretax earnings we generate in the us as compared to other countries or new taxes in the united states or foreign jurisdictions could result in additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate

 

general risks

 

investigations and litigation could require management time and or incur substantial legal costs or fines penalties or damages any of which could materially adverse impact on our financial results

 

as a multinational corporation expeditors is subject to formal or informal investigations from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which we do business in addition we may become subject to civil litigation with our customers service providers and other parties with whom we do business these investigations and litigation may require significant management time and could cause us to incur substantial additional legal and related costs which may include fines penalties or damages that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results

 item 2 — properties

expeditor’s corporate headquarters are located in seattle washington we conduct operations in approximately 450 locations worldwide of which approximately 100 are in the united states and 21 are owned these owned and leased locations are primarily located close to an airport ocean port or on an important border crossing these facilities are strategically located to cover the geographic areas served by expeditors the majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities we will from time to time investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities we believe that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases

 




 item 3 — legal proceedings

expeditors is involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to inherent uncertainties currently in managements opinion and based upon advice from legal advisors none of these matters are expected to have a significant effect on our operations cash flows or financial position as of december 31 2020 the amounts recorded for these claims lawsuits government investigations and other legal matters are not significant to our operations cash flows or financial position at this time we are unable to estimate any additional loss or range of reasonably possible losses if any beyond the amounts recorded that might result from the resolution of these matters

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

expeditors international of washington inc provides a full suite of global logistics services our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs brokerage warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services temperaturecontrolled transit cargo insurance specialized cargo monitoring and tracking and other supply chain solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assets 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected our business operations for the year ended december 31 2020 and we expect these disruptive conditions to continue into 2021 the significant impacts are discussed under item 1 business section and below within results of operations

we derive our revenues by entering into agreements that are generally comprised of a single performance obligation which is that freight is shipped for and received by our customer each performance obligation is comprised of one or more of the companys services we typically satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered over time a typical shipment would include services rendered at origin such as pickup and delivery to port freight services from origin to destination port and destination services such as customs clearance and final delivery our three principal services are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue

we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and then reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the rate billed to our customers the sell rate is recognized as revenues and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is recognized in operating expenses as the directly related cost of transportation and other expenses by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves

in most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments

customs brokerage and other services involve providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and import services such as arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices we also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinitive transportation services and consulting

in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services when we assume risk of loss when we have discretion in setting the prices for the services to the customers and we have the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party when revenue is recorded on a net basis the amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue

24

 

we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions that are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018  

 

our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability which includes shared revenues and allocated costs therefore individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share of revenue at the destination

north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 38 of revenues 44 of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 37 of operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 north asias directly related cost of transportation and other expenses are higher than other segments due to the largely export nature of the operations in that region the people’s republic of china including hong kong represented more than 84 of north asia revenues 85 of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 79 operating income for the year ended december 31 2020

expeditors culture

we believe that our unique culture at the center of which are our employees is a critical component to our continued success we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge global consistency and compliance is fundamental to preserving our culture and network of people processes technology and locations

our business growth strategy emphasizes a focus on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth through the aggressive marketing of our service offerings innovative solutions integrated platforms and data quality are vital to achieving a competitive advantage expeditors teams are aligned on the specific markets on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors

our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations in reaction to the pandemic and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory

our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize carriers are highly leveraged with debt and many are incurring or have recently incurred operating losses as a result carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges exacerbated by the pandemic and are seeking relief under various government support programs this environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition however when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage or specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network in may 2020 we acquired a lessthantruckload digital online shipping platform which aligns with our focus on enhancing our digital solutions

international trade and competition

we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy the global economy entered into a recession as a result of the pandemic and related precautionary measures including government lockdowns shutdown of manufacturing and operations for nonessential businesses and travel restrictions international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to tariffs and trade restrictions and accords currently the united states and china have significantly increased tariffs on certain imports and are engaged in trade negotiations and changes to export regulations and tariffs we cannot predict the outcome of changes in tariffs or interpretations and trade restrictions and accords and the effects they will have on our business as governments implement higher tariffs on imports manufacturers may accelerate to the extent possible shipments to avoid higher tariffs and over time may shift manufacturing to other countries doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies and intergovernmental disputes concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping lanes in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade oil prices and security costs

in 2020 the united kingdom and the european union negotiated the terms of the united kingdoms exit from the european union eu which were effective on january 1 2021 these rules and regulations are in the process of being implemented and are subject to further interpretation and change the full impact of the united kingdom’s departure and impact to international trade is still uncertain 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over availability of airfreight and ocean freight 

26

 

capacity volatile carrier pricing  disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue 

air carriers are experiencing significant cash flow challenges as a result of travel restrictions resulting in cancellation of flights and have incurred record operating losses in 2020 uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel in particular business travel compared to prepandemic levels may impact air carriers’ operations and financial stability long term prior to 2020 many ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt these conditions have resulted in multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

there is uncertainty as to how new regulatory requirements and volatility in oil prices will continue to impact future buy rates because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both our buy rates and sell rates we would expect our revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices to the extent that future fuel prices increases and we are unable to pass through the increases to our customers this could adversely affect our operating income

the global economic and trade environments remain uncertain including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic we cannot predict the impact of future changes in global trade on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our business in response to governments implementing higher tariffs on imports as well as responses to the pandemic’s disruptions some customers have begun shifting manufacturing to other countries which could negatively impact us 

critical accounting estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap preparing our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report

management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas









these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and tax liabilities and contingencies are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported

the outcome of loss contingencies including legal proceedings and claims and government investigations brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding claim or government investigation is recorded by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is made if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be recorded management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year

accounting for income taxes involves significant estimates and judgments we are subject to taxation in various states and in many foreign jurisdictions including the people’s republic of china including hong kong taiwan vietnam india mexico canada netherlands and the united kingdom management believes that our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and that they are 

27

 

consistently applied we are under or may be subject to audit or examination and assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter s ometimes audits and examinations result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in significant additional tax penalties and interest payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax position in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors 

the total amount of our tax contingencies may increase in 2021 in addition changes in state federal and foreign tax laws and changes in interpretations of these laws may increase our existing tax contingencies the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations can be highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ significantly from the amounts recorded it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we may undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and it is also possible that we may reach resolution related to income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in future years and may increase the amount of tax expense we recognize as well as the potential for penalties and interest being incurred our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on our experience judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction though we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable t he actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of its resolution

as discussed in note 1g to the consolidated financial statements earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for impacts associated with us tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the us as compared to the rest of the world and the impact of any discrete items for events occurring in the period or future changes in tax regulations and related interpretations

2020 compared with 2019

airfreight services

in the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of 2020 airfreight services experienced unprecedented events in response to the global pandemic as a result of travel restrictions and lower passenger demand airlines significantly reduced flight schedules which limited available belly space for cargo at a time where global demand for timesensitive delivery of essential ppe medical supplies and technology equipment remained high demand grew in the fourth quarter and a concentration of flights to key gateway hubs caused congestion at airports that put further constraints on available capacity these conditions have caused extreme imbalances between carrier capacity and demand principally on exports out of north asia in order to execute and meet the transportation needs of our customers we heavily utilized charter flights and purchased capacity in advance and on the spot market which resulted in historically high average buy and sell rates 

airfreight services revenues increased 63 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to a 78 increase in average sell rates partially offset by a 3 decrease in tonnage sell rates increased to unprecedented levels in all regions with the largest impacts in north asia and south asia tonnage through most of the year was affected by the decline in international trade as a result of the pandemic tonnage declined in all regions except north asia north asia airfreight services revenue represented 24 and 14 of the total company consolidated revenues for 2020 and 2019 respectively

airfreight services expenses increased 72 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to an 81 increase in average buy rates partially offset by a 3 decrease in tonnage buy rates increased in all regions with the largest impacts in north asia and south asia

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we experienced record high tonnage and continued high average sell rates and buy rates when compared to the third quarter of 2020 demand for airfreight grew while capacity shortages persisted in particular on exports from north asia airfreight services revenues and expenses increased 41 and 47 respectively from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020 principally 

30

 

due to 20 and 24 increase in average sell rates and buy rates and a 20 increase in tonnage compared the fourth quarter 2019 airfreight services revenues and expenses increased 104 and 116 respectively principally due to 99  and 104  increase in average sell rates and buy rates and a 10 increase in tonnage airfreight services revenues and expenses represented 49 and 52 of our total revenues and expenses respectively in the fourth quarter of 2020  

the annual decrease in airfreight tonnage was primarily due to the global pandemic as a result of the pandemic governments around the world implemented travel restrictions and suspended nonessential services this caused supply chain disruptions for our domestic and international customers which correspondingly decreased our airfreight volumes in 2020 south asia north america and europe had decreases in tonnage of 22 5 and 8 respectively when compared to 2019 north asia had an increase in tonnage of 13 in 2020 as compared with 2019

these conditions create a high degree of volatility in volumes buy rates and sell rates and are expected to continue into 2021 as international passenger flights are not expected to return to prepandemic levels and additional capacity from freighters is limited the historically high buy and sell rates have significantly contributed to the growth in our expenses and revenues and financial results in 2020 these unprecedented operating conditions are not expected to be sustained longterm we are unable to predict how these uncertainties and any future disruptions such as continued urgent distribution of covid19 vaccines will affect our future operations or financial results 

 

ocean freight and ocean services 

 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses increased 6 and 9 respectively in 2020 as compared with 2019 the largest component of our ocean freight and ocean services revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 66 and 65 of ocean freight and ocean services revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

 

ocean freight consolidation revenues and expenses increased 8 and 10 respectively in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to a 13 increase in sell rates and a 15 increase in buy rates partially offset by a 3 decrease in containers shipped ocean freight volumes and pricing were impacted by the effect of the pandemic in 2020 starting in the first quarter of 2020 there was a sharp decrease in international trade and low demand primarily from disruptions in manufacturing and store closures during that period ocean carriers managed their capacity to market demand resulting in increases in buy rates demand increased in the second half of the year and soared in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to backlogs in supply chains and low inventory levels creating a severe imbalance between demand and capacity in particular on exports from north asia and south asia the deficiency in available capacity was further exacerbated by congestion at ports due to labor and equipment shortages which disrupted sailing schedules and resulted in higher average buy rates sell rates and volumes increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we were able to timely adjust to market conditions and leverage our capacity agreements with ocean carriers

 

direct ocean freight forwarding revenues and expenses increased 6 and 11 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to higher volumes changes in customer mix and higher costs as a result of congestion at the ports primarily in north america order management revenues and expenses decreased 2 and 1 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to lower volumes mostly from the retail industry

 

north asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses increased 7 and 9 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to higher average buy and sell rates partially offset by a 1 decline in container volumes south asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses increased 20 and 22 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to higher average sell and buy rates and a 6 increase in containers shipped in 2020 the largest decline in container volume was in exports from north america 

most ocean carriers experienced significant increase in market demand in the latter part of the year and we expect this demand to continue into 2021 until port congestion and equipment shortages subside we believe there will be continued pressure on buy rates we also expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers solicit bids react to governmental trade policies and adjust to the continued disruptions of the global economy from the pandemic while carriers continue to adapt to changes in capacity and market demand and merge or create alliances with other carriers carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 to reduce the use of sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs which could result in higher costs for us these conditions could result in lower operating income

customs brokerage and other services

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses each decreased 2 in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to decreases in shipments from existing customers in the first three quarters of the year slowdowns due to the pandemic related closures affected volumes particularly in aerospace automotive oil and energy and certain portions of the retail sectors and the onboarding of new customers was negatively impacted customers continue to value our brokerage services due to changing tariffs and increasing complexity in the declaration process customers seek knowledgeable customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program that are necessary to rapidly respond to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

31

 

north america revenues and directly related expenses decreased 3  and 4  respectively in 2 020  as compared with 20 19  primarily as a result of lower volumes in customs brokerage  

overhead expenses

salaries and related costs increased 8 in 2020 as compared with 2019 principally due to increases in commissions and bonuses earned from higher revenues and operating income

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and operating income has been the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating an alignment between branch and corporate performance and shareholder interests 

our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven bonuses to field management in 2020 were up 26 when compared to the same period in 2019 bonuses under the executive incentive compensation plan were up 17 primarily due an increase in operating income offset by a reduction made to senior executive management bonus allocations as well as unused bonus allocations available for future investments in the development of key personnel 

because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of the short operating cycle of our services the potential for shortterm gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the longterm growth in operating income and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs

other overhead expenses remained constant in 2020 as compared with 2019 there was a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expense due to travel restrictions that was offset primarily by increases in bad debt claims and contingencies indirect taxes and depreciation expense we will continue to make important investments in people processes and technology as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth

income tax expense

 

our consolidated effective income tax rate was 270 in 2020 as compared to 256 in 2019 the effect of higher average tax rates of our international subsidiaries when compared to us federal and state tax rates were partially offset by us foreign tax credits and us income tax deductions for foreignderived intangible income fdii in 2020 when compared to 2019 the earnings of our international subsidiaries were proportionally higher than that of our us subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019 we benefited from us federal tax credits totaling 167 million and 157 million respectively principally because of withholding taxes related to our foreign operations as well as us income tax deductions for fdii of 10 million and 9 million respectively in 2020 when compared to 2019 we benefited from increased tax deductions for sharebased compensation principally stock option exercises of our employees these amounts were partially offset by the effect of higher foreign tax rates of our international subsidiaries when compared to the us federal income tax rate of 21 as well as certain expenses that are no longer deductible under the 2017 tax act including certain executive compensation in excess of amounts allowed in 2019 we benefited from state income tax refunds totaling approximately 4 million

some elements of the recorded impacts of the 2017 tax act could be impacted by further legislative action as well as additional interpretations and guidance issued by the irs or treasury see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option and restricted stock unit grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recorded excess tax benefits are recorded upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options and vesting of rsus and psus while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans shares cannot be anticipated and are therefore recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate may be more or less volatile based on the amounts of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective rate is greater when pretax income is lower total consolidated foreign income tax expense is composed of the income tax expense of our nonus subsidiaries as well as income based withholding taxes paid by our nonus subsidiaries on behalf of its parent for intercompany payments including the remittance of dividends

currency and other risk factors

the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2020 2019 and 2018 was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2020 and 2019 net foreign currency losses were approximately 25 million 9 million and 2 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry including new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs higher claims or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network

liquidity and capital resources

our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 655 million as compared with 772 million for 2019 this 117 million decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital principally from excess customer billings over collections when compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of growth in activity and high sell rates in the fourth quarter of 2020 offset by increased earnings at december 31 2020 working capital was 2071 million including cash and cash equivalents of 1528 million we had no longterm debt at december 31 2020 management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations

as a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms our accounts receivable and consequently our customer credit exposure has also increased as a result of historically high freight rates management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems

our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash

33

 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 46 million  which is consistent with 2019  we had capital expenditures of 48 million in 2020 and 47 million 2019  capital expenditures in 2020 related primarily to our purchase of a lessthantruckload digital online shipping platform continuing investments in building and leasehold improvements and technology and facilities equipment  occasionally we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight total anticipated capital expenditures in 2021 are currently estimated to be  45 million  this includes routine capital expenditures and investments in technology 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 332 million as compared with 418 million in 2019 we used the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to reduce issued and outstanding shares during 2020 and 2019 we used cash to repurchase 46 million and 53 million shares of common stock respectively to reduce the number of total outstanding shares during 2020 and 2019 we paid dividends of 104 and 100 per share respectively

we have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 160 million shares of common stock during 2020 we repurchased 46 million shares at an average price of 7226 per share we had a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of march 31 2019 all shares authorized under this plan have been repurchased see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans

we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity historically our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by disruptions occurring in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future

we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and political uncertainty nor the covid19 pandemic may continue to have on our operating results freight volumes pricing amounts advanced on behalf of our customers changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior

at december 31 2020 we were contingently liable for 72 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the accounting records of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform

 



 

at december 31 2020 our contractual obligations are as follows

 



 

we typically enter into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill in the regular course of business we also enter into agreements with service providers to maintain or operate equipment facilities or software that can be longer than one year we also regularly have contractual obligations for specific projects related to improvements of our owned or leased facilities and information technology infrastructure

34

 

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and funds necessary to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2020  cash and cash equivalent balances of  620 million were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which  27 million was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

impact of inflation

to date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation however significant direct carrier rate increases occurred in 2020 as a result of the disruptions caused by the pandemic and are expected to continue in the short to medium term due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2020 we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented below

foreign exchange risk

we conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in billings issued in a country and currency that differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2020 would have had the effect of raising operating income by approximately 69 million  a n average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income by approximately 56 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions

we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2020 was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 25 million 9 million and 2 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2020 and 2019 we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2020 we had 117 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days

interest rate risk

at december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1528 million of which 926 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2020 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2020 would not have a significant impact on our earnings

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2020 and 2019

 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

none




 item 9a — controls and procedures

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level

changes in internal controls

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we are developing a new accounting system which is being implemented on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness

our management has confidence in our internal controls and procedures nevertheless our management including expeditors’ chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all of our control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2020 our internal control over financial reporting was effective

our strategy

expeditors continues to focus on executing key strategic initiatives that are designed to achieve longterm earnings growth the strategic plan is to grow our business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors’ teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors while we continue to emphasize expanding our business in north america we simultaneously remain focused on growth based on three key strategic initiatives







our chief strategy officer continues to oversee all strategy within expeditors with a deep focus on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansion

global logistics and supply chain technology

expeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize a single enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply 

5

 

chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate security disaster recovery and high availability 

expeditors’ technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing maintaining and enhancing technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functions

we are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers we continuously monitor emerging technologies for potential applicability to our business expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics creates greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly important we are continually enhancing our systems including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems

organic versus acquired growth

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage or specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network nevertheless despite our history of organic growth we are not opposed to acquisitions and we will continue to identify and assess potential acquisitions

tailored solutions

as a nonasset based logistics services provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions by understanding a customers logistics and supply chain processes strategies and objectives we identify targeted areas of opportunity for improvement and deploy the right services and solutions for that customer these services include our core offerings of transportation customs clearance warehousing and distribution and order management along with expertise in supply chain analysis and optimization trade compliance consulting cargo insurance cargo security and solutions for oversized and heavylift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operational processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliance while focusing on the individual needs of each customer

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our sales strategies and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our sales strategies at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retention

leveraging global regional and local expertise

at expeditors we create strategy process technology and compliance programs at the corporate level in order to drive consistency across all levels of the organization we leverage regional and local expertise by staffing our districts principally with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in logistics coupled with a deep understanding of their local market district offices are responsible for selling and executing expeditors services directly to customers and prospects and are involved in the selection of logistics service providers in addition to ensuring that customers receive timely and effective services defining our strategy at a global level while executing it at a regional and local level with customized supply chain solutions enables us to drive consistency and efficiency we believe that focus on hiring and developing a diverse and talented workforce with an emphasis on exceptional customer service along with our incentivebased compensation program enables us to provide exceptional service and superior financial results

what expeditors ships

the goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination these goods include products from multiple industries including electronics high technology healthcare aerospace and aviation manufacturing oil and energy automotive retail and fashion in order to meet customers complex and industryspecific demands we utilize industry vertical teams throughout our network that focus on providing tailored solutions to different industries industry vertical teams work closely with our regional and district resources to grow our business no single customer accounts for five percent or more of our revenues

expeditors services in detail

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services

6

 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 36 40 and 42 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo capacity from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with securing capacity during periods of high demand

in our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations

we estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3000 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both

at the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within 48 hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand available cargo capacity from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demand

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained directly from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment

our airfreight revenues less directly related costs of transportation and other expenses for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge our customers for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses exposure to volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service

although airline profitability has improved many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers financial results will continue to drive their asset acquisition and deployment strategies which will impact airfreight pricing and capacity most of expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible certain customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping changes in available capacity periods of high demand or other market disruptions could impact our buy and sell rates and challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

ocean freight and ocean services

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 27 28 and 30 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management

7

 

ocean freight consolidation  as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export and import laws 

direct ocean forwarding  when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management  order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management delivery management and ordersku visibility through our webbased portal customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates required delivery dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization document creation and visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via our webbased portal order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt multiple carrier acquisitions and alliances are occurring and certain carriers are entering into traditional freight forwarding services as they pursue scale and additional market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing additionally many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity this excess capacity is at the heart of the carriers financial challenge as they pursue business at lower rate levels to achieve higher load factors carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

expeditors’ pricing is based on contract negotiations each year with our global carrier partners our pricing model is flexible we purchase based on customer needs and our carrier strategy determines our volume and pricing commitments fixed pricing arrangements are entered into for a portion of our forecasted commitments while spot market pricing arrangements are typically negotiated at the regional and local levels

we offer our customers a wide carrier footprint globally to meet their changing needs with fewer global carriers than in the past maintaining close relationships with our carrier partners allows us to meet our customers’ space requirements throughout the year including during peak periods

customs brokerage and other services

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 37 32 and 28 percent of expeditors total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively as a customs broker we assist our customers in clearing shipments through customs by preparing and transmitting required information and documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging required inspections by governmental agencies and providing delivery services we provide customs brokerage services in conjunction with transportation services or independently expeditors supports regulatory compliance and visibility to the supply chain through process and system controls technology and oversight by licensed and trained professionals we offer a customized solutionsbased approach to our customers based on the complexity of their business our pricing reflects this complexity and scope in addition to the number of declarations filed

we also provide other value added services within our network such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and industryspecific valueadded services our warehousing services are offered primarily in leased facilities utilized by multiple customers customers benefit from cost savings related to space labor equipment and other efficiencies delivered in a transactional pricing model expeditors transcon consists of multimodal intracontinental ground transportation and delivery services and includes valueadded 

8

 

white glove and timedefinite services expeditors responds to customerdriven requests for trade compliance consulting services primarily through tradewin fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

competition

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited certain ocean carriers are entering into traditional freight forwarding services as they pursue scale and additional market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry some of our competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong presence in certain markets

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry

larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics and supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities is a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi and application program interfaces api online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimization

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated supply chain requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we compete

unlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting systems running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions

our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units revenues and operating income available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage

currency and dependence on service providers

our worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agents

in addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal demand trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods

environmental

in the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although our current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business

expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the impact of our operations on the environment and assisting our customers in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint we have employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 1 emissions include all direct greenhouse gas emissions scope 2 includes indirect greenhouse gas emission from purchased electricity heat or steam we have voluntarily disclosed our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data to cdp since 2010 we are also attentive to our scope 3 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain therefore we are currently a member of both smartway and transporte limpio in north america smartway is a voluntary publicprivate program sponsored by the epa for tracking documenting and sharing information about fuel use and freight emissions across supply chains transporte limpio is a similar voluntary program sponsored by the mexican government

employees

at december 31 2019 expeditors employed approximately 18000 people of which approximately 11500 were employed in international locations

expeditors is a party to collective bargaining agreements with a limited number of employees outside the us and we do not consider these agreements to be material we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees expeditors places considerable emphasis on our nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states expeditors is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security dhs as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation each expeditors office is licensed or in the case of our newer offices has applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of our airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata members

expeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically establishing the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of dhs nationally and in each us customs district in which we do business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which expeditors performs customs clearance services we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services expeditors participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states as well as other security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries

we do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license

the continuing global threats from terrorism cyberattacks smuggling and wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries have resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to tighten border controls and minimize the exposure of their citizens to criminal elements and potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our services

when acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent generally when acting solely as the agent of the shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the carrier

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally  050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent 

when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track

in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2019 was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

expeditors international of washington inc provides a full suite of global logistics services our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs brokerage warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services temperaturecontrolled transit cargo insurance specialized cargo monitoring and tracking and other logistics solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assets

we derive our revenues by entering into agreements that are generally comprised of a single performance obligation which is that freight is shipped for and received by our customer each performance obligation is comprised of one or more of the companys services we typically satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered over time a typical shipment would include services rendered at origin such as pickup and delivery to port freight services from origin to destination port and destination services such as customs clearance and final delivery our three principal services are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue

we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and then reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the rate billed to our customers the sell rate is recognized as revenues and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is recognized in operating expenses as the directly related cost of transportation and other expenses by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves

in most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments

customs brokerage and other services involve providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and import services such as arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices we also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinitive transportation services and consulting

in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services when we assume risk of loss when we have discretion in setting the prices for the services to the customers and we have the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party when revenue is recorded on a net basis the amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue

19

 

we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions that are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  

 

 

our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability which includes shared revenues and allocated costs therefore individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1e to the consolidated financial statements in this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at the destination

north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 31 of revenues 36 of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 33 of operating income for the year ended december 31 2019 north asias directly related cost of transportation and other expenses are higher than other segments due to the largely export nature of the operations in that region the people’s republic of china including hong kong represented more than 85 of north asia revenues 86 of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 81 operating income for the year ended december 31 2019

expeditors culture 

from the inception of our company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel we believe that our greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands

















we reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success we believe in a “real world” environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a career

we believe that our unique culture is a critical component to our continued success we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge

our business growth strategy emphasizes a focus on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors teams are aligned on the specific markets on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors

our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory

our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize although airline profitability has improved many carriers remain highly leveraged with debt moreover the ocean carrier industry has incurred substantial losses in recent years many carriers are highly leveraged with debt and certain carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges this environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways

21

 

international trade and competition 

we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to tariffs and trade restrictions and accords currently the united states and china have significantly increased tariffs on certain imports and are engaged in trade negotiations the united kingdom and the european union are negotiating the terms of the united kingdoms exit from the european union we cannot predict the outcome of these proposals or negotiations or the effects they will have on our business as governments implement higher tariffs on imports manufacturers may accelerate to the extent possible shipments to avoid higher tariffs and over time may shift manufacturing to other countries doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies and intergovernmental disputes concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping lanes in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade oil prices and security costs

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations additionally carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which may increase capacity carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

there is uncertainty as to how new regulatory requirements and changes in oil prices will continue to impact future buy rates because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both our buy rates and sell rates we would expect our revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices to the extent that we are unable to pass through any increases to our customers this could adversely affect our operating income

we expect china trade and hence our operations to be affected by the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus covid19 that began in china and was declared by the world health organization as a global health emergency as precautionary measures the government in china extended the lunar new year holiday into february 2020 and has implemented travel restrictions and closures of certain central china ports and government offices additionally factories have experienced extended closures and certain airlines are cancelling flights to and from china as a result certain of our central china offices have experienced closures and limited operations and shipments are being rerouted or delayed by customers and service providers who are taking their own precautionary measures also available airfreight capacity could be reduced affecting our ability to efficiently route our customers’ freight any such conditions of operations for an extended period of time would result in a reduction in shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations in 2020 in addition to traditional supply chain movements we also believe this may have a further impact to global supply chains through potential shortages of raw materials parts and supplies

the global economic and trade environments remain uncertain we cannot predict the impact of future changes in global trade on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our business in response to governments implementing higher tariffs on imports some customers have begun shifting manufacturing to other countries which could negatively impact us 

critical accounting estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap preparing our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report

22

 

management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 









these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and tax liabilities and contingencies are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported

the outcome of loss contingencies including legal proceedings and claims and government investigations brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding claim or government investigation is recorded by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is made if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be recorded management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year

accounting for income taxes involves significant estimates and judgments we are subject to taxation in various states and in many foreign jurisdictions including the people’s republic of china including hong kong taiwan vietnam india mexico canada netherlands and the united kingdom management believes that our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and that they are consistently applied we are under or may be subject to audit or examination and assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter s ometimes audits and examinations result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in significant additional tax penalties and interest payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax position in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors 

the total amount of our tax contingencies may increase in 2020 in addition changes in state federal and foreign tax laws and changes in interpretations of these laws may increase our existing tax contingencies the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations can be highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ significantly from the amounts recorded it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we may undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and it is also possible that we may reach resolution related to income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in future years and may increase the amount of tax expense we recognize as well as the potential for penalties and interest being incurred our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on our experience judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction though we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable t he actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of its resolution

as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly prior to the implementation of the requirements of us tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act in december of 2017 us federal and state income taxes were provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for impacts associated with us tax reform under the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the us as compared to the rest of the world and the impact of any discrete items for events occurring in the period or future changes in tax regulations and related interpretations

results of operations

this section of this form 10k generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 discussions of 2017 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018

the following table shows the revenues the directly related cost of transportation and other expenses for our principal services and our overhead expenses for 2019 2018 and 2017 the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report

2019 compared with 2018

airfreight services

airfreight services revenues decreased 10 in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to a 9 decrease in sell rates and a 6 decrease in tonnage as a result of the softening of market demand due to slowing of the global economy and continuing intergovernmental trade disputes north asia north america and europe revenues decreased 16 15 and 13 respectively in 2019

airfreight services expenses decreased 11 in 2019 respectively as compared with the same periods for 2018 principally as a result of a 9 decrease in buy rates and a 6 decrease in tonnage due to available carrier capacity relative to market demand north asia north america and europe directly related expenses decreased 16 18 and 15 respectively in 2019

most regions experienced decreases in tonnage with the largest being north asia north america and europe with declines in tonnage of 9 5 and 5 respectively in 2019 the latter part of 2018 benefited from customers accelerating shipments in order to avoid higher tariffs 

the global airfreight market has been experiencing imbalances between carrier capacity and demand in certain lanes which is resulting in lower buy and sell rates these conditions are exacerbated by ongoing inter governmental trade disputes and uncertainties  customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping these conditions could be affected by new product launches and customer responses to governmental trade policies during periods that have historically experienced higher demand these conditions should they continue to occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates  

 

25

 

ocean freight and ocean services 

 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses decreased 2 and 3 respectively in 2019 as compared with 2018 the largest component of our ocean freight and ocean services revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 65 and 68 of ocean freight and ocean services revenue in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

 

ocean freight consolidation revenues and expenses decreased 6 and 7 respectively in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to a 3 decline in containers shipped primarily in north asia and north america the 2019 decline in containers shipped began in the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter with a quarterly decline of 13 compared to fourth quarter 2018 the latter part of 2018 benefited from customers accelerating shipments in order to avoid higher tariffs the changes in freight consolidation revenues and directly related expenses also include the revised presentation of destination services in 2019 which decreased revenues and directly related operating expenses in ocean freight consolidation but did not change consolidated operating income

 

direct ocean freight forwarding revenues and expenses increased 9 and 12 respectively primarily due to higher volumes in north america and europe order management revenues and expenses increased 6 and 7 respectively mostly resulting from higher volumes in south asia

 

north asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses decreased 13 and 15 respectively primarily due to a decrease in container volume this was partially offset by an increase in south asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses of 12 and 9 respectively primarily due to an increase in container volume and higher sell and buy rates

we expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers solicit bids react to governmental trade policies and carriers adapt to changes in capacity and market demand and merge or create alliances with other carriers carriers also face new regulatory requirements that become effective in 2020 to reduce the use of sulfur in marine fuel which are increasing their operating and capital costs which could result in higher costs for us these conditions could result in lower operating income 

customs brokerage and other services

customs brokerage and other services revenues increased 16 and expenses increased 23 in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to increased demand for brokerage services and timedefinite value added road freight services customers are seeking knowledgeable customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program necessary to rapidly respond to changes in the regulatory and security environment the 2019 results include the effect of changing our presentation of certain import services from a net to a gross basis and our revised presentation of destination services which increased revenues and directly related operating expenses in customs brokerage and other services but did not change operating income 

north america revenues and directly related expenses increased 23 and 33 respectively and europe revenues and directly related expenses increased 4 and 6 respectively in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily as a result of higher volumes in road freight and the effect of the change in presentation of certain import services 

overhead expenses

salaries and related costs increased 2 in 2019 as compared with 2018 principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe higher base salaries and stock based compensation partially offset by reductions in bonus earned from lower operating income the number of employees increased primarily to support increased activity in our business operations

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and operating income has been the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating an alignment between branch and corporate performance and shareholder interests 

26

 

our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven bonuses to field management in 2019 were up 2  when compared to the same period in 2018 bonuses under the executive incentive compensation plan were down 12  primarily due a decrease in operating income a 3 reduction made to senior executive management bonus allocations as well as unused bonus allocations available for future investments in the development of key personnel 

because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of the short operating cycle of our services the potential for shortterm gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the longterm growth in operating income and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs

other overhead expenses increased 4 in 2019 as compared with 2018 the increase in expenses was due to renting additional space occupancy costs technologyrelated fees consulting expenses and warehouse expenses partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense we will continue to make important investments in people processes and technology as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth

income tax expense

 

our consolidated effective income tax rate was 256 in 2019 as compared to 243 in 2018 the effect of higher average tax rates of our international subsidiaries when compared to us federal and state tax rates were partially offset by us foreign tax credits and us income tax deductions for foreignderived intangible income fdii in 2019 and 2018 we benefited from us federal tax credits totaling 157 million and 203 million respectively principally because of withholding taxes related to our foreign operations as well as us income tax deductions for foreignderived intangible income fdii of 90 and 48 million respectively in addition in both 2019 and 2018 we benefited from state income tax refunds totaling approximately 4 million these amounts were partially offset by the effect of higher foreign tax rates of our international subsidiaries when compared to the us federal income tax rate of 21 as well as certain expenses that are no longer deductible under the 2017 tax act including certain executive compensation in excess of amounts allowed

some elements of the recorded impacts of the 2017 tax act could be impacted by further legislative action as well as additional interpretations and guidance issued by the irs or treasury see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option and restricted stock unit grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recorded excess tax benefits are recorded upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options and vesting of rsus and psus while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans shares cannot be anticipated and are therefore recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate may be more or less volatile based on the amounts of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective rate is greater when pretax income is lower total consolidated foreign income tax expense is composed of the income tax expense of our nonus subsidiaries as well as income based withholding taxes paid by our nonus subsidiaries on behalf of its parent for intercompany payments including the remittance of dividends

currency and other risk factors

the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2019 2018 and 2017 was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018 net foreign currency losses were approximately 9 million 2 million and 13 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry including new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force

27

 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs higher claims or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network

liquidity and capital resources

our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 772 million as compared with 573 million for 2018 this 199 million increase is primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in earnings at december 31 2019 working capital was 1602 million including cash and cash equivalents of 1230 million we had no longterm debt at december 31 2019 management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations

as a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems

our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 46 million as compared with 48 million for 2018 we had capital expenditures of 47 million in 2019 which is consistent with 2018 capital expenditures in 2019 related primarily to continuing investments in building and leasehold improvements and technology and facilities equipment occasionally we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight total anticipated capital expenditures in 2020 are currently estimated to be 50 million this includes routine capital expenditures and investments in technology

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 418 million as compared with 628 million in 2018 we used the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to reduce issued and outstanding shares during 2019 and 2018 we used cash to repurchase 53 million and 90 million shares of common stock respectively to reduce the number of total outstanding shares during 2019 and 2018 we paid dividends of 100 and 090 per share respectively

we have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 160 million shares of common stock during 2019 we repurchased 52 million shares at an average price of 7289 per share we had a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of march 31 2019 all shares authorized under this plan have been repurchased during 2019 we repurchased 88 thousand shares at an average price of 7403 per share see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans

we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity historically our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by disruptions occurring in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and political uncertainty may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing amounts advanced on behalf of our customers changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior

at december 31 2019 we were contingently liable for 69 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the accounting records of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform

 



 

at december 31 2019 our contractual obligations are as follows

 



 

we typically enter into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill in the regular course of business we also enter into agreements with service providers to maintain or operate equipment facilities or software that can be longer than one year we also regularly have contractual obligations for specific projects related to improvements of our owned or leased facilities and information technology infrastructure

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and funds necessary to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2019 cash and cash equivalent balances of 457 million were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which 5 million was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states

impact of inflation

to date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2019 we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented below

foreign exchange risk

we conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in billings issued in a country and currency that differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2019 would have had the effect of raising operating income by approximately 51 million  a n average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income by approximately 41 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions

we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2019 was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 9 million 2 million and 13 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018 we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2019 we had 46 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days

interest rate risk

at december 31 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1230 million of which 813 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2019 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2019 would not have a significant impact on our earnings

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2019 and 2018




 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with acco untants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none




 item 9a — controls and procedures

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level

changes in internal controls

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we are developing a new accounting system which is being implemented on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness

our management has confidence in our internal controls and procedures nevertheless our management including expeditors’ chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all of our control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected

management report on internal control over financial reporting

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2019 our internal control over financial reporting was effective

the expeditors network 

beginning in 1981 expeditors’ primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s we began to expand our service capabilities in airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today expeditors has approximately 17500 employees and provides a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise we plan to create new offices while expeditors has historically expanded through organic growth we have also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

at january 31 2019 expeditors including its majorityowned subsidiaries is organized functionally in geographic operating segments and operates district offices in the regions identified below our district offices have been established in locations where expeditors maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock

our strategy 

in 2018 expeditors continued executing key strategic initiatives that are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings growth the strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors’ teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors as we continue to expand our business in north america we remain focused on growth based on three key strategic initiatives 

 our chief strategy officer continues to oversee all strategy within expeditors with a deep focus on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansion 

global logistics and supply chain technology 

expeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize an enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate security disaster recovery and high availability 

expeditors’ technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing maintaining and enhancing technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functions 

we are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics creates greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly important 

organic versus acquired growth 

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage or specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network nevertheless despite our history of organic growth we are not opposed to acquisitions and we will continue to identify and assess potential acquisitions 

4  

tailored solutions 

as a nonasset based logistics services provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions based on a customer’s unique needs by understanding a customers logistics and supply chain processes strategies and objectives we identify targeted areas of opportunity for improvement and deploy the right services and solutions for that customer these services include our core offerings of transportation customs clearance warehousing and distribution and order management along with expertise in supply chain analysis and optimization trade compliance consulting cargo insurance cargo security and solutions for oversized and heavylift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operational processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliance 

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our sales strategies and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our sales strategies at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

leveraging global regional and local expertise 

at expeditors we create strategy process technology and compliance programs at the corporate level to drive consistency across all levels of the organization we leverage regional and local expertise by staffing our districts principally with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in logistics coupled with a deep understanding of their local market district offices are responsible for selling and executing expeditors services directly to customers and prospects and are involved in the selection of logistics service providers in addition to ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient services defining our strategy at a global level and executing it at a regional and local level with customized supply chain solutions enables us to drive consistency and efficiency we believe that focus on hiring and developing talented individuals with an emphasis on exceptional customer service along with our incentivebased compensation program enables us to provide exceptional service and superior financial results 

what expeditors ships 

the goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination these goods include products from multiple industries including electronics high technology healthcare aerospace and aviation manufacturing oil and energy automotive retail and fashion in order to meet customers complex and industry specific demands we utilize industry vertical teams throughout our network to focus on providing tailored solutions to different industries industry vertical teams work closely with our regional and district resources to grow our business no single customer accounts for five percent or more of our revenues or net revenues 

expeditors services in detail 

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 40 42 and 40 percent of expeditors total revenues and 33  32  and 32  percent of total net revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo capacity from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with securing capacity during periods of high demand 

in our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

we estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3000 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

at the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within 48 hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand available cargo capacity from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

5  

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

our airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge our customers for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses exposure to volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service 

  

although airline profitability has improved many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers financial results will continue to drive their asset acquisition and deployment strategies which will impact airfreight pricing and capacity most of expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible certain customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping changes in available capacity periods of high demand or other market disruptions could impact our buy and sell rates and challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 28 30 and 32 percent of expeditors total revenues and 22  24  and 25  percent of total net revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight consolidation    as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export and import laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management    order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and ordersku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates required delivery dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

6  

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of a major carrier as well as multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing additionally while overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity this excess capacity is at the heart of the carriers financial challenge as they pursue business at lower rate levels to achieve higher load factors consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 32 28 and 28 percent of expeditors total revenues and 45  44  and 43  percent of total net revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively as a customs broker we assist in clearing shipments through customs by preparing and transmitting required information and documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging required inspections by governmental agencies and providing delivery services we provide customs brokerage services in conjunction with transportation services or independently expeditors supports regulatory compliance and visibility to the supply chain through process and system controls technology and oversight by licensed and trained professionals 

we also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services expeditors responds to customerdriven requests for trade compliance consulting services primarily through tradewin fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry some of our competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong presence in certain markets 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry 

larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics and supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities is a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi and application program interfaces api online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimization 

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated supply chain requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we compete 

unlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting systems running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage

currency and dependence on service providers 

our worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agents 

in addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal demand trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although our current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business we do not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2019  

expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the sum total impact of our operations on the environment we have approximately 200 employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 1 emissions include all direct greenhouse gas emissions scope 2 includes indirect greenhouse gas emission from purchased electricity heat or steam we have voluntarily disclosed our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data to cdp since 2010 and we are currently a member of both smartway and transporte limpio in north america smartway is a voluntary publicprivate program sponsored by the epa for tracking documenting and sharing information about fuel use and freight emissions across supply chains transporte limpio is a similar voluntary program sponsored by the mexican government 

employees 

at december 31 2018  expeditors employed approximately 17400 people of which approximately 11000 were employed in international locations 

expeditors is a party to collective bargaining agreements with a limited number of employees outside the us and we do not consider these agreements to be material we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees expeditors places considerable emphasis on our nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states expeditors is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security dhs as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation each expeditors office is licensed or in the case of our newer offices has applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of our airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata members

expeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically establishing the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of dhs nationally and in each us customs district in which we do business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which expeditors performs customs clearance services we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services expeditors participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states as well as other security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries 

we do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global threats from terrorism cyberattacks and wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries have resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent generally when acting solely as the agent of the shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the carrier 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations 

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally 050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent 

when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 

in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2018  was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs brokerage warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services temperaturecontrolled transit cargo insurance specialized cargo monitoring and tracking and other logistics solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assets 

we derive our revenues by entering into agreements that are generally comprised of a single performance obligation which is that freight is shipped for and received by our customer each performance obligation is comprised of one or more of the companys services we typically satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered over time a typical shipment would include services rendered at origin such as pickup and delivery to port freight services from origin to destination port and destination services such as customs clearance and final delivery our three principal services are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue 

we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and then reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to our customers the sell rate and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

in most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments 

customs brokerage and other services involve providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices 

in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services when we assume risk of loss when we have discretion in setting the prices for the services to the customers and we have the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party when revenue is recorded on a net basis the amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions that are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

18  

our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability which includes shared revenues and allocated costs therefore individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network 

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1e to the consolidated financial statements in this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at the destination 

north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 35  of revenues 22  of net revenues and 35  of operating income for the year ended december 31 2018  north asias net revenues as a percentage of revenues is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

expeditors culture 

from the inception of our company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global services organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel we believe that our greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 



19  

 we reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success we believe in a “real world” environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a career 

we believe that our unique culture is a critical component to our continued success we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

our business growth strategy emphasizes a focus on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors teams are aligned on the specific markets on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory 

our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize although airline profitability has improved many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt moreover the ocean carrier industry has incurred substantial losses in recent years many carriers are highly leveraged with debt and certain carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges this environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers capacity allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways 

international trade and competition 

we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to tariffs and trade restrictions and accords currently the united states and china have significantly increased tariffs on certain imports and are engaged in trade negotiations the united kingdom and the european union are negotiating the terms of the united kingdoms exit from the european union we cannot predict the outcome of these proposals or negotiations or the effects they will have on our business as governments implement higher tariffs on imports manufacturers may accelerate to the extent possible shipments to avoid higher tariffs and over time may shift manufacturing to other countries doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies and intergovernmental disputes concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue 

20  

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations additionally while overall global demand has recently increased carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which creates additional capacity carriers also face new regulatory requirements that become effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the use of marine fuel sulfur which is expected to increase their operating and capital costs when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

currently there is uncertainty as to how changes in oil prices will continue to impact future buy rates because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both our cargo space buy rates and our sell rates to customers we would expect our gross revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices to the extent that we are unable to pass through any increases to our customers this could adversely affect our net revenues 

the global economic environment and trade growth remain uncertain we cannot predict the impact of future changes in global trade on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our business 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and tax liabilities and contingencies are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcome of loss contingencies including legal proceedings and claims and government investigations brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding claim or government investigation is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

we are subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly prior to the implementation of the requirements of us tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act in december of 2017 us federal and state income taxes were provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for impacts associated with us tax reform under the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments management believes our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course expeditors is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in significant additional tax penalties and interest payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax position in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the 

21  

taxing jurisdiction we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities penalties and interest could be materially different from estimates 

our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the us as compared to the rest of the world and the impact of any discrete items for events occurring in the period or future changes in tax regulations and related interpretations 

results of operations 

the following table shows the revenues and directly related expenses for our principal services and total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to our principal services and our expenses for 2018  2017  and 2016  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned by expeditors as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to us for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by expeditors in our other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by us net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to manage sell rates to customers with our ability to concentrate and leverage our purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 

the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report

airfreight services revenues increased 14 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily due to higher sell rates in response to increased buy rates resulting from higher overall market demand and tonnage growth of 3 airfreight services expenses increased 13 in 2018  as compared with 2017  principally as a result of the increase in tonnage and higher buy rates due to tighter carrier capacity and increased fuel prices 

airfreight services net revenues in 2018  increased 15 as compared with 2017  this was principally due to a 15 increase in net revenue per kilo and a 3 growth in tonnage average net revenue per kilo increased in most regions primarily due to higher average sell rates that increased commensurate with higher average buy rates north america europe and south asia net revenues increased by 13 17 and 13 respectively while tonnage increased 6 8 and 1 respectively north asia net revenues increased by 17 despite a tonnage decrease of 2 as we adjusted our sell rates primarily in response to higher carrier buy rates and achieved a better mix of business in 2017 carriers significantly increased pricing in north asia and south asia as a result of higher demand relative to available capacity 

overall the global airfreight market has been experiencing strong growth which has caused imbalances between carrier capacity and demand in certain lanes and higher average buy rates customers are continuously focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates utilizing ocean freight whenever possible and evaluating alternative sourcing locations at the same time customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping these conditions could be affected by new product launches and customer responses to governmental trade policies during periods that have historically experienced higher demand these conditions should they continue to occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses increased 7 and 8 respectively in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily due to a 5 increase in container volume and growth in direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 4 in 2018  as compared with 2017  the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 43 and 45 of ocean freight net revenue in 2018  and 2017  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 2 in 2018  as compared with 2017  this decrease was due primarily to lowering our sell rates in response to competitive market conditions partially offset by a 5 increase in volume direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 6 due to higher volumes in north asia and europe order management net revenues increased 11 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north america and north asia 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 4 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily due to higher order management volumes europe net revenues increased 8 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily due to growth in direct ocean freight forwarding north asia net revenues increased 3 in 2018  as compared with 2017  as growth in direct ocean forwarding and order management was largely offset by lower net revenue per container mair net revenues increased 8 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily due to higher direct ocean forwarding revenues 

we expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers solicit bids react to governmental trade policies and carriers adapt to changes in capacity and market demand merge or create alliances with other carriers these conditions could result in lower margins 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues increased 35 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in customs brokerage road freight and warehouse and distribution services customs brokerage and other services expenses increased 55 in 2018  as compared with 2017  principally as a result of higher volumes in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard we analyzed contracts with customers in our warehouse and distribution business in 2018 we changed our presentation of certain warehouse and distribution revenues from a net to a gross basis which increased both revenues and operating expenses by approximately 225 million in 2018 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 17 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in customs brokerage road freight and distribution volumes particularly in north america europe and north asia customers continue to seek out customs brokers such as expeditors with a commitment to compliance high level of expertise and sophisticated systems capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 14 in 2018  as compared with 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in customs brokerage road freight and distribution services europe net revenues increased 28 primarily due to higher customs brokerage road freight and distributions services net revenues north asia net revenues increased 23 primarily due to higher customs brokerage volumes 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 10 in 2018  as compared with 2017  due principally to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe higher base salaries and benefits and increased bonuses from higher operating income the number of employees increased primarily to support increased activity in our business operations 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues has been the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating alignment between branch and corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2018  were up 12 while operating income increased 14 our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 55 to 53 in 2018  as compared with 2017  

because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers due to the nature of our services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for shortterm gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking 

24  

management believes that both the stability and the longterm growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs 

other overhead expenses increased 22 in 2018  as compared with 2017  the increase in expenses was due to additional rent and technologyrelated fees partially offset by lower claims in 2017 we recovered certain legal and related costs totaling 8 million had a favorable resolution of an indirect tax contingency of 6 million and recognized a 4 million gain on the sale of a property we will continue to make important investments in people processes and technology as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues for 2018  increased from 15 to 17 as compared with 2017  principally as a result of the events in 2017 discussed above 

income tax expense 

we pay income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions our consolidated effective income tax rate was 243  in 2018  as compared with 318  in 2017  in addition to the lower us federal tax rate that resulted from the 2017 tax act our effective tax rate in 2018 benefited from significant sharebased compensation deductions us federal tax credits totaling 203 million principally as a result of withholding taxes related to our foreign operations and us income tax deductions for foreignderived intangible income fdii of 48 million these amounts were partially offset by the effect of higher foreign tax rates of our international subsidiaries when compared to the us federal income tax rate of 21 as well as certain expenses that are no longer deductible under the 2017 tax act including certain executive compensation in excess of amounts allowed 

the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option and restricted stock unit grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recorded excess tax benefits are recorded upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options and vesting of rsus and psus while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans shares cannot be anticipated and are therefore recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate may be more or less volatile based on the amounts of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective rate is greater when pretax income is lower total consolidated foreign income tax expense is composed of the income tax expense of our nonus subsidiaries as well as income based withholding taxes paid by our nonus subsidiaries on behalf of its parent for intercompany payments including the remittance of dividends 

2017  compared with 2016   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues increased 17 in 2017  as compared with 2016  this increase is attributed to tonnage growth across all segments and higher average sell rates principally on exports out of north asia and europe we increased sell rates in response to higher buy rates caused by an overall increase in market demand airfreight services expenses increased 21 in 2017  as compared with 2016  as a result of the 10 increase in tonnage and higher average buy rates due to tighter carrier capacity 

airfreight services net revenues in 2017  increased 7 as compared with 2016  the increase was principally due to a 10 increase in tonnage partially offset by a 6 decrease in net revenue per kilo average net revenue per kilo declined in most regions primarily due to competitive market conditions and tight carrier capacity carriers in north asia and south asia increased pricing significantly as a result of higher demand relative to available capacity north america north asia and europe net revenues increased 10 8 and 15 respectively due primarily to tonnage increases of 12 6 and 12 respectively south asia net revenues decreased 12 despite a 12 increase in tonnage primarily due to lower average sell rates and higher average buy rates 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 10 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily due to a 5 increase in container volume and higher average sell rates to customers ocean freight and ocean services expenses increased 12 in 2017  as compared with 2016  due to volume growth and higher average buy rates resulting from overall market demand and carriers managing available capacity 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 5 in 2017  as compared with 2016  the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 45 and 48 of ocean freight net revenue in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 1 in 2017  as compared with 2016  this decrease was due primarily to a 6 decrease in net revenue per container largely offset by a 5 increase in volume direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 6 due to higher volumes order management net revenues increased 13 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north asia and south asia 

north asia ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 11 in 2017  as compared with 2016  due principally to 4 growth in volume and order management north america and south asia net revenues both increased 1 as higher volumes were largely offset by lower margins europe net revenues decreased 1 due to a decline in net revenue per container mostly offset by volume growth 

25  

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 12 and 16 respectively in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 9 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of an increase in customs brokerage and road freight volumes particularly in north america and europe 

north america net revenues increased 11 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in road freight and customs brokerage services europe net revenues increased 12 due primarily to growth in import road freight and warehouse and distribution services 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 9 in 2017  as compared with 2016  principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america south asia and europe higher salaries and an increase in bonuses resulting from higher operating income 

bonuses to field and executive management in 2017  were up 47 as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of a 45 increase in operating income our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven salaries and related costs increased to 55  of net revenues in 2017 as compared with 53  in 2016 

other overhead expenses increased 5 in 2017  as compared with 2016  we continue to invest in additional technology and facilities which resulted in higher rent and facilities expenses technologyrelated fees and consulting costs these increases were offset by a 4 million gain on the sale of a property lower claims the favorable resolution of an indirect tax contingency of 6 million and the recovery of certain legal and related costs totaling 8 million in 2017 compared to 5 million in 2016 we will continue to make important investments in people processes and technology as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth other overhead expenses decreased to 15 of net revenues in 2017  from 16 in 2016  

income tax expense 

our consolidated effective income tax rate was 318  in 2017  as compared to 370  in 2016  the change in the effective tax rate was principally due to recording the estimated impact of us tax reform and to a lesser degree a result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants and restricted stock units 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2018  2017  and 2016  was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  net foreign currency losses were approximately 2 million  and 13 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  in 2016  

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry including new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs higher claims or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a 

26  

worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018  was 573 million  as compared with 489 million  for 2017  this 84 million  increase is primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by changes in working capital at december 31 2018  working capital was 1408 million  including cash and cash equivalents of 924 million  we had no longterm debt at december 31 2018  management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

as a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2018  was 48 million  as compared with 12 million  for 2017  we had capital expenditures of 47 million  in 2018  as compared with 95 million  in 2017  capital expenditures in 2018  related primarily to continuing investments in technology building construction building and leasehold improvements occasionally we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight in 2017 we completed the sale of land and buildings in miami florida which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately 84 million total anticipated capital expenditures in 2019  are currently estimated to be 50 million this includes routine capital expenditures and investments in technology 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2018  was 628 million  as compared with 425 million  in 2017  we used the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to reduce issued and outstanding shares during 2018  and 2017  we used cash to repurchase 9 million and 8 million shares of common stock respectively to reduce the number of total outstanding shares during 2018  and 2017  we paid dividends of 090  and 084  per share respectively 

we have a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises during 2018  we repurchased 26 million  shares at an average price of  7271  per share we also have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 160 million  shares of common stock during 2018  we repurchased 65 million  shares at an average price of 7118  per share see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans 

we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity historically our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by disruptions occurring in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and political uncertainty may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing amounts advanced on behalf of our customers changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

we maintain international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2018  we were contingently liable for 68 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 

27  



at december 31 2018  our contractual obligations are as follows 



we typically enter into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill in the regular course of business we also enter into agreements with service providers to maintain or operate equipment facilities or software that can be longer than one year we also regularly have contractual obligations for specific projects related to improvements of our owned or leased facilities and information technology infrastructure 

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and funds necessary to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalent balances of 444 million  were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which 2 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

impact of inflation 

to date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency that differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2018  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately  55 million a n average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 45 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency 

28  

fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2018  was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 2 million  and 13 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and net currency gains were approximately 8 million  in 2016  we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2018  we had 42 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 924 million  of which 496 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2018  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2018  would not have a significant impact on our earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2018  and 2017  




 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are developing a new accounting system which is being implemented on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness 

29  

in 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard and in 2019 we will adopt the new accounting standard for leases the adoption of these accounting standards requires further changes to existing processes and systems that are an integral part of our internal controls and require testing for operating effectiveness 

our management has confidence in our internal controls and procedures nevertheless our management including expeditors’ chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all of our control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2018  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  which is included on page f2

we provide a broad range of customer solutions such as order management timedefinite transportation warehousing and distribution temperaturecontrolled transit cargo insurance specialized cargo monitoring and tracking and other customized logistics solutions in addition our project cargo unit handles special project shipments that move via a single method or combination of air ocean andor ground transportation and generally require a high level of specialized attention because of the unusual size or nature of what is being shipped 

expeditors primary services include 

 airfreight services within airfreight expeditors typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers routing expertise familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of high demand 

solutions within airfreight services include 

air freight consolidation as an airfreight consolidator expeditors purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to our customers at lower rates than what those customers could negotiate directly from the airlines on an individual shipment expeditors determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and then selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point where either we or one of our agents then arrange for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of each individual shipment to its final destination 

air freight forwarding  as a freight forwarder expeditors receives and forwards individual unconsolidated shipments and arranges the transportation with the airline that carries the shipment 

ocean freight and ocean services within ocean freight services expeditors offers three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight consolidation as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors contracts with ocean shipping carriers to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at agreedupon rates we handle both full container loads as well as lessthan container load lcl freight charging lower rates than what is available directly from the shipping lines we also generate fees for ancillary services such as shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when a customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier expeditors acts as that customer’s agent and we may receive a commission from the carrier in addition to customer handling fees 

2  

order management    expeditors provides a range of order management services collecting fees from the shipper in addition to generating fees for meeting specific customer needs through expeditors’ order management we consolidate cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin into the fewest possible number of containers putting more product in larger and fewer containers to maximize space and minimize cost

the expeditors network 

beginning in 1981 expeditors’ primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s we began to expand our service capabilities in airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today expeditors has approximately 16500 employees and provides a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise we plan to create new offices while expeditors has historically expanded through organic growth we have also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

at january 31 2018 expeditors including its majorityowned subsidiaries is organized functionally in geographic operating segments and operates district offices in the regions identified below our district offices have been established in locations where expeditors maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock 

3  

expeditors operates 177 district offices in the following geographic areas of responsibility 

 we also maintain branch offices which are aligned with and dependent on one district office additionally we contract with independent agents to provide required services and have established 39 such relationships worldwide

our strategy 

in 2017 expeditors continued executing key strategic initiatives that are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings growth the strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors’ teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors we remain focused on growth based on four key strategic initiatives 

 

in addition in early 2017 we announced the appointment of philip m coughlin to the newly created position of chief strategy officer reporting directly to president and chief executive officer jeff musser mr coughlins role is to develop and oversee a core strategy group within expeditors comprised of current employees with a deep understanding of our products services and technology and external individuals with expertise in supply chain management data and market analysis and technology while mr coughlins team is responsible for all strategy development the teams focus is on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansion 

global logistics and supply chain technology 

expeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize an enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate security disaster recovery and high availability 

expeditors’ technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing maintaining and enhancing technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functions 

we are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics create greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly important

organic versus acquired growth 

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage and specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network nevertheless despite our history of organic growth we are not opposed to acquisitions and we will continue to identify and assess potential acquisitions 

tailored solutions and targeted marketing 

as a nonasset based provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions based on a customer’s needs by understanding a customers logistics processes and goals we are able to identify opportunities for improvement and are able to deploy relevant services and solutions for that customer these services include all modes of cargo transportation customs brokerage warehousing and distribution and order management expeditors core services are further supported by our expertise in providing industryspecific solutions supply chain analysis and optimization cargo insurance cargo security and solutions for oversized and heavy lift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operations and processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliance 

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our marketing strategy and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our strategic marketing at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

leveraging global regional and local expertise 

expeditors defines strategy processes technology and compliance at the corporate level with input from our regional and district leadership that is further supported and executed at all levels with dedicated account management personnel coupled with regional and local expertise we staff our districts principally with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics district managers and their staff are responsible for selling expeditors services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient services we believe that this regional and local expertise in supply chain solutions tailored to the needs of our customers and our emphasis on exceptional customer service along with our incentivebased compensation program that rewards employees based on the performance of the operations they control have been important elements of our success   we believe this balanced approach between corporate regional and local expertise enables us to provide solutions customized to the needs of our customers 

what expeditors ships 

the goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination these goods include products from multiple industries including electronics high technology healthcare aerospace and aviation manufacturing oil and energy automotive retail and fashion in order to meet customers complex and industry specific demands we utilize industry vertical teams throughout our network to focus on providing solutions in different industries industry vertical teams work closely with our regional and district resources to grow our business no single customer accounts for five percent or more of our net revenues 

expeditors services in detail 

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 42 40 and 41 percent of expeditors total revenues and 32  32  and 34  percent of total net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of high demand 

in our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

5  

we estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3000 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

at the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within 48 hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

our airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge our customers for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service 

  

although airline profitability has improved many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers financial results will continue to drive their asset acquisition and deployment strategies which will impact airfreight pricing and capacity many of expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible certain customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping changes in available capacity periods of high demand or other market disruptions could impact our buy and sell rates and challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 30 32 and 33 percent of expeditors total revenues and 24  25  and 25  percent of total net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight consolidation    as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management    order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize 

6  

space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of a major carrier as well as multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing additionally while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity this excess capacity is at the heart of the carriers financial challenge as they pursue business at lower rate levels to achieve higher load factors consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 28 28 and 26 percent of expeditors total revenues and 44  43  and 41  percent of total net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively as a customs broker we assist in clearing shipments through customs by preparing and transmitting required information and documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging required inspections by governmental agencies and providing delivery services we provide customs brokerage services in conjunction with transportation services or independently expeditors supports regulatory compliance and visibility to the supply chain through process and system controls technology and oversight by licensed and trained professionals 

we also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services none of which individually are currently significant to our total revenues and net revenues expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services expeditors responds to customer drivenrequests for trade compliance consulting services primarily through tradewin fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry some of our competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry 

larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimization 

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we compete 

unlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage 

7  

currency and dependence on service providers 

our worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agents 

in addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal demand trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business we do not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2018  

expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the sum total impact of our operations on the environment we have over 200 employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 1 emissions include all direct greenhouse gas emissions scope 2 includes indirect greenhouse gas emission from purchased electricity heat or steam we have voluntarily disclosed our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data to cdp since 2010 and we are currently a member of both smartway and transporte limpio in north america smartway is a voluntary publicprivate program sponsored by the epa for tracking documenting and sharing information about fuel use and freight emissions across supply chains transporte limpio is a similar voluntary program sponsored by the mexican government 

employees 

at december 31 2017  expeditors employed approximately 16500 people of which approximately 10500 were employed in international locations 

expeditors is a party to collective bargaining agreements with a limited number of employees outside the us and we do not consider these agreements to be material we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees expeditors places considerable emphasis on our nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states expeditors is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security dhs as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation each expeditors office is licensed or in the case of our newer offices we have applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of our airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata members 

9  

expeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically establishing the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of dhs nationally and in each us customs district in which we do business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which expeditors performs customs clearance services we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services expeditors participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states as well as other security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries 

we do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global threats from terrorism and wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries have resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent generally when acting solely as the agent of the shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the carrier 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations 

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally 050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent 

when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 

in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2017  was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance specialized cargo monitoring and tracking and other customized logistics solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assets 

we derive our revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements 

we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to our customers the sell rate and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue 

in most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor are obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service have latitude in establishing price have discretion in selecting the direct carrier have credit risk or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof 

for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices 

we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and often touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

18  

our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network 

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs 

north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 37  of revenues 22  of net revenues and 35  of operating income for the year ended december 31 2017  north asias net revenues as a percentage of revenues is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

expeditors culture 

from the inception of our company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel we believe that our greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 



19  

 we reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key nonexecutive manager can be compensated for success we believe in a “real world” environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a career 

we believe that our unique culture is a critical component to our continued success we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory 

our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize although airline profitability has improved many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt moreover the ocean carrier industry has incurred substantial losses in recent years many carriers are highly leveraged with debt and certain carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges such as those that led to the bankruptcy filing of a major carrier that occurred in august 2016 this environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways 

international trade and competition 

we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords we cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on our business doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue 

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of a major carrier as well as multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations additionally while overall global demand has recently increased carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which creates additional capacity when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

the global economic environment and trade growth have improved but remain uncertain we cannot predict the impact of future changes in global trade on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities 

20  

to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our business 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and tax liabilities and contingencies are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcome of loss contingencies including legal proceedings and claims and government investigations brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding claim or government investigation is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

we are subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and accordingly us federal and state income taxes have historically been provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits of our foreign subsidiaries 

accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments management believes our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course expeditors is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in significant additional tax penalties and interest payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax position in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities penalties and interest could be materially different from estimates 

as discussed in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changes us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

prospectively excluding the impact of any discrete items the provisions of the 2017 tax act are expected to reduce our effective tax rate compared to what the rate would have otherwise been in the absence of us tax reform the ultimate impact on our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the us as compared to the rest of the world

results of operations 

the following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to our principal services and our expenses for 2017  2016  and 2015  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned by expeditors as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to us for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by expeditors in our other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by us net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to manage sell rates to customers with our ability to concentrate and leverage our purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 

the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report 



22  

2017  compared with 2016   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues increased 17 in 2017  as compared with 2016  this increase is attributed to tonnage growth across all segments and higher average sell rates principally on exports out of north asia and europe we increased sell rates in response to higher buy rates caused by an overall increase in market demand airfreight services expenses increased 21 in 2017  as compared with 2016  as a result of the 10 increase in tonnage and higher average buy rates due to tighter carrier capacity 

airfreight services net revenues in 2017  increased 7 as compared with 2016  the increase was principally due to a 10 increase in tonnage partially offset by a 6 decrease in net revenue per kilo average net revenue per kilo declined in most regions primarily due to competitive market conditions and tight carrier capacity carriers in north asia and south asia increased pricing significantly as a result of higher demand relative to available capacity north america north asia and europe net revenues increased 10 8 and 15 respectively due primarily to tonnage increases of 12 6 and 12 respectively south asia net revenues decreased 12 despite a 12 increase in tonnage primarily due to lower average sell rates and higher average buy rates 

since late 2016 the global airfreight market has been experiencing imbalances between carrier capacity and demand in certain lanes which is resulting in higher average buy rates customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible customers are increasingly utilizing airfreight to improve speed to market we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity and the evolution of consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping these conditions could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demand historically we have experienced lower airfreight margins in the fourth quarter as seasonal volumes increase and carriers correspondingly increase buy rates these events should they continue to occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates 

23  

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 10 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily due to a 5 increase in container volume and higher average sell rates to customers ocean freight and ocean services expenses increased 12 in 2017  as compared with 2016  due to volume growth and higher average buy rates resulting from overall market demand and carriers managing available capacity 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 5 in 2017  as compared with 2016  the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 45 and 48 of ocean freight net revenue in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 1 in 2017  as compared with 2016  this decrease was due primarily to a 6 decrease in net revenue per container largely offset by a 5 increase in volume direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 6 due to higher volumes order management net revenues increased 13 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north asia and south asia 

north asia ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 11 in 2017 as compared with 2016 due principally to 4 growth in volume and order management north america and south asia net revenues both increased 1 as higher volumes were largely offset by lower margins europe net revenues decreased 1 due to a decline in net revenue per container mostly offset by volume growth 

we expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers solicit bids and carriers adapt to changing market conditions merge or create alliances with other carriers these conditions could result in lower margins 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 12 and 16 respectively in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 9 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of an increase in customs brokerage and road freight volumes particularly in north america and europe customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 11 in 2017  as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in road freight and customs brokerage services europe net revenues increased 12 due primarily to growth in import road freight and warehouse and distribution services 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 9 in 2017  as compared with 2016  principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america south asia and europe higher salaries and an increase in bonuses resulting from higher operating income 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2017  were up 47 as compared with 2016  primarily as a result of a 45 increase in operating income our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven salaries and related costs increased to 55  of net revenues in 2017 as compared with 53  in 2016 

because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers our services have a short operating cycle as a result the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for shortterm gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the longterm growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs 

other overhead expenses increased 5 in 2017  as compared with 2016  we continue to invest in additional technology and facilities which resulted in higher rent and facilities expenses technologyrelated fees and consulting costs these increases were offset by a 4 million gain on the sale of a property lower claims the favorable resolution of an indirect tax contingency of 6 million and the recovery of certain legal and related costs totaling 8 million in 2017 compared to 5 million in 2016 we will continue to make important investments in people 

24  

processes and technology as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth other overhead expenses decreased to 15  of net revenues in 2017  from 16  in 2016  

income tax expense 

we pay income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions our consolidated effective income tax rate was 318  in 2017  as compared with 370  in 2016  the change in the effective tax rate was principally due to recording the estimated impact of us tax reform and to a lesser degree a result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants and restricted stock units the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option and restricted stock unit grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs 

our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower total consolidated foreign income tax expense is composed of the income tax expense of our nonus subsidiaries as well as income based withholding taxes paid by our nonus subsidiaries on behalf its parent for intercompany payments including the remittance of dividends for example our effective foreign tax rate increased from 309 in 2016 to 339 in 2017 principally due to withholding tax payments associated with dividend payments from our nonus subsidiaries prospectively excluding the impact of discrete items recorded in a future reporting period and any changes recorded in 2018 to provisional 2017 income tax expense amounts as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the provisions of the 2017 tax act are expected to reduce our annual effective tax rate to an estimated rate between 31 and 34 the ultimate impact on our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the us as compared to the rest of the world and the other factors discussed above 

2016  compared with 2015   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues decreased 10 in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of lowering average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions the decrease in average sell rates was partially offset by a 3 growth in airfreight tonnage airfreight services expenses decreased 12 in 2016  as compared with 2015  as a result of favorable buying opportunities throughout most regions due primarily to excess available carrier capacity while not possible to quantify sell rates and tonnage were favorably impacted in 2015 by customers converting a portion of their ocean freight shipments to airfreight due to port disruptions on the us west coast 

airfreight services net revenues in 2016 decreased 7 as compared with 2015 the decrease was principally due to a 12 decrease in net revenue per kilo partially offset by a 3 increase in tonnage average net revenue per kilo declined in most regions primarily due to competitive market conditions and rapid changes in carrier pricing caused by sporadic increases in demand north america net revenues decreased by 6 due principally to a 3 decrease in tonnage north asia south asia and europe net revenues decreased 10 9 and 2 respectively despite tonnage increases of 5 7 and 3 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues decreased 13 in 2016 as compared with 2015 as we continued to lower average sell rates to customers in response to competitive market conditions and lower available buy rates from carriers although average sell rates to customers declined container volumes increased 3 ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 16 in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to lower average buy rates resulting from carrier overcapacity 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2016 as compared with 2015 in 2016 and 2015 the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 48 and 50 respectively of ocean freight net revenue 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 6 in 2016 as compared with 2015 this decrease was due primarily to an 8 decrease in net revenue per container partially offset by a 3 increase in volume during the latter part of the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a spike in average buy rates that began with the bankruptcy of a large ocean carrier on august 31 2016 direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues decreased 2 due to lower volumes principally in north america order management net revenues increased 11 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north asia and south asia 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 3 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to lower direct ocean forwarding volumes and a decrease in ocean freight consolidation resulting from declining margins on imports north asia net revenues decreased 1 as lower margins were offset by a 1 growth in volume europe net revenues decreased 4 as lower direct ocean forwarding volumes more than offset growth from order management and ocean freight consolidation south asia net revenues increased 6 due principally to 4 growth in volumes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 3 and 1 respectively in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of increased volumes from existing and new road freight customers 

25  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 4 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in road freight volumes customers continued to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 5 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in road freight and lower import service costs north asia net revenues increased 8 due primarily to growth in import and warehouse and distribution services europe net revenues remained constant as compared with 2015 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 1 in 2016 as compared with 2015 principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe partially offset by reduced bonuses from lower operating income 

bonuses to field and executive management in 2016 were down 7 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of a 7 decrease in operating income salaries and related costs increased to 53 of net revenues in 2016 as compared with 52 in 2015 

other overhead expenses increased 4 in 2016 as compared with 2015 the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher rent and maintenance costs and technology fees partially offset by lower claims other overhead expenses increased to 16 of net revenues in 2016 as compared with 15 in 2015 

income tax expense 

our consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 370  in 2016  as compared to 376  in 2015  the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally the result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2017  2016  and 2015  was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  net foreign currency losses were approximately 13 million  in 2017  and net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  in both 2016 and 2015  

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 489 million  as compared with 529 million  for 2016  this 40 million  decrease is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable partially offset by higher earnings at december 31 2017  working capital was 1448 million  including cash and cash equivalents of 1051 million  we had no longterm debt at december 31 2017  management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

26  

as a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and tax to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations in demand and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 12 million  as compared with 53 million  for 2016  we had capital expenditures of 95 million  in 2017  as compared with 59 million  in 2016  capital expenditures in 2017  related primarily to continuing investments in technology the substantial completion of the construction of a building in europe office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements occasionally we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight in 2016 we completed a land acquisition for which the funds had been deposited into escrow in 2014 and initiated building construction for the aforementioned building in europe in 2017 we completed the sale of land and buildings in miami florida which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately 84 million total anticipated capital expenditures in 2018  are currently estimated to be 75 million 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 425 million  as compared with 299 million  in 2016  we used the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to limit the growth in issued and outstanding shares during 2017  and 2016  we used cash to repurchase 8 million and 7 million shares of common stock respectively during 2017  and 2016  we paid dividends of 084  and 080  per share respectively 

we have a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises during 2017  we repurchased 37 million  shares at an average price of  5747  per share we also have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 170 million  shares of common stock during 2017  we repurchased 45 million  shares at an average price of 5872  per share see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans 

we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity our investment portfolio has historically not been significantly adversely impacted by disruptions in credit markets however there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and political uncertainty may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

we maintain international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2017  we were contingently liable for 75 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



at december 31 2017  our contractual obligations are as follows 

27  



we typically enter into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill historically we have met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience almost all committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2017  will be fulfilled during 2018  in the ordinary course of business 

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2017  cash and cash equivalent balances of 446 million  were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which 47 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly historically a deferred tax liability has been established for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

as a result of us tax reform a liability of approximately 32 million for the estimate of the onetime mandatory tax on undistributed earnings of the companys nonus subsidiaries was recorded as of december 31 2017 the cash tax effects of this deemed repatriation can be remitted in installments over an eightyear period as follows i for each of the initial five years 8 of the net tax liability is required to be remitted on an annual basis ii in the sixth year 15 of the net tax liability is required to be remitted iii in the seventh year 20 of the net tax liability is required to be remitted and iv in the eighth year the remaining 25 of the net tax liability is required to be remitted we anticipate that we will pay this tax in installments over the eightyear period and anticipate cash payments of the deemed repatriation tax to approximate 2 million to 3 million in each of the next five years 

impact of inflation 

to date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency that differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2017  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately  48 million a n average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 39 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

28  

we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2017  was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 13 million  in 2017  and net currency gains were approximately 8 million  in both 2016  and 2015  we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2017  we had 17 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1051 million  of which 668 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2017  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2017  would not have a significant impact on our earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2017  and 2016  




 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are developing a new accounting system which is being implemented on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness 

in the next two fiscal years we will adopt two significant new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and accounting for leases the adoption of these accounting standards will require changes to existing processes and systems that are an integral part of our internal controls and will require testing for operating effectiveness 

29  

our management has confidence in our internal controls and procedures nevertheless our management including expeditors’ chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all of our control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2017  our internal control over financial reporting was effective

the expeditors network

our strategy 

in 2016 expeditors continued executing key strategic initiatives that were developed in late 2014 by our executive team those operational initiatives are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings growth the strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors’ teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors we are continuing our focus on growth based on four key strategic initiatives 

 

in addition in early 2017 we announced the appointment of philip m coughlin to the newly created position of chief strategy officer effective on february 28 and reporting directly to president and chief executive officer jeff musser mr coughlins role is to establish and oversee a core strategy group within expeditors comprised of current employees with a deep understanding of our products services and technology and external individuals with expertise in supply chain management data and market analysis and technology mr coughlins team will be focused on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansion 

global logistics and supply chain technology 

expeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize an enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate disaster recovery and high availability 

expeditors’ technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing and maintaining technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functions 

we are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics create greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly important 

organic versus acquired growth 

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage and specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network nevertheless despite our history of organic growth we are not opposed to acquisitions and we will continue to identify and assess desirable acquisitions 

  3  

tailored solutions and targeted marketing 

as a nonasset based provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions based on a customer’s needs by understanding a customers logistics processes and goals we are able to identify opportunities for improvement and are able to deploy relevant services and solutions for that customer these services include all modes of cargo transportation customs brokerage warehousing and distribution and order management expeditors core services are further supported by our expertise in providing industryspecific solutions supply chain analysis and optimization cargo insurance cargo security and solutions for oversized and heavy lift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operations and processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliance 

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our marketing strategy and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our strategic marketing at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retention

expeditors services in detail 

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 40 41 and 42 percent of expeditors total revenues and 32  34  and 34  percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of high demand 

in our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

we estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

at the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

our airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when expeditors acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment our net revenues are derived primarily from airline commissions and customer fees for ancillary services 

  4  

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service 

  

although airline profitability has improved over the last two years many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products companies continue to decrease the size and weight of shipments and many expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying expeditors has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings for our customers the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

in 2015 airfreight customers continued to seek reductions in rates related to lower fuel prices that trend persisted in 2016 along with carriers incorporating the lower fuel rates into their pricing structures there continues to be uncertainty as to how future buy rates will be impacted by continuing volatility in fuel prices due to a number of factors because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts expeditors buy and sell rates we would expect our airfreight revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the impact of changing fuel prices however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to changes we would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from any future movements in fuel prices 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 32 33 and 33 percent of expeditors total revenues and 25  25  and 23  percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight consolidation    as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management    order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of one of the larger carriers in the market as well as multiple mergers and acquisitions as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing additionally while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity this excess capacity is at the heart of the carriers financial challenge as they pursue business at lower rate levels to achieve higher load factors consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

oil prices are reflected in both the buy and sell rates for ocean freight via a surcharge known as the bunker adjustment factor this surcharge in the industry fluctuates with the cost of the bunker fuel and is added to base ocean freight charges however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to changes expeditors would not expect an adverse effect on ocean freight net revenues resulting from future movements in oil prices

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 28 26 and 25 percent of expeditors total revenues and 43  41  and 43  percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a customs broker we assist importers in clearing shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the brokerage business require that we continuously enhance our systems to provide competitive service we provide customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments we handle through our transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments that we handle may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

we also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services none of which individually are currently significant to our total revenues and net revenues expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services expeditors whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer drivenrequests for trade compliance consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry 

larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimization 

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we compete 

unlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage 

currency and dependence on service providers 

our worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agents 

in addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business we do not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2017  

expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the sum total impact of our operations on the environment we have over 200 employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol scope 1 emissions include all direct greenhouse gas emissions scope 2 includes indirect greenhouse gas emission from purchased electricity heat or steam we have voluntarily disclosed our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data to the carbon disclosure project since 2010 and we are currently a member of both smartway and transporte limpio in north america smartway is a voluntary publicprivate program sponsored by the epa for tracking documenting and sharing information about fuel use and freight emissions across supply chains transporte limpio is a similar voluntary program sponsored by the mexican government 

employees 

at december 31 2016  expeditors employed approximately 16000 people of which approximately 10000 were employed in international locations 

expeditors is a party to collective bargaining agreements with a limited number of employees outside the us and we do not consider these agreements to be material we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees expeditors places considerable emphasis on our nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states expeditors is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation each expeditors office is licensed or in the case of our newer offices we have applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of our airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata members 

expeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically establishing the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

  8  

expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which we do business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which expeditors performs customs clearance services we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services expeditors participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states as well as other security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries 

we do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global threats from terrorism wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations 

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally 050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent 

when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 

in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2016  was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assets 

we derive our revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements 

we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to our customers the sell rate and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments 

  16  

from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue 

in most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor are obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service have latitude in establishing price have discretion in selecting the direct carrier have credit risk or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof 

for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices 

we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network 

  17  

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs 

north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 37  of revenues 22  of net revenues and 34  of operating income for the year ended december 31 2016  north asias net revenues as a percentage of revenues is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

expeditors culture 

from the inception of our company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel we believe that our greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 we reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key nonexecutive manager can be compensated for success we believe in a “real world” environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a career 

we believe that failure to perpetuate our unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout our organization quite possibly provides a greater threat to our continued success than any external force which likely would be largely beyond our control we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory 

our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize over the last two years airline profitability has improved although many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt moreover the ocean carrier industry has incurred substantial losses in recent years many carriers are highly leveraged with debt and certain carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges such as those that led to the bankruptcy filing of a large ocean carrier that occurred in august 2016 this situation requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways 

international trade and competition 

we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords we cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on our business doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by recent political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating 

  18  

currency exchange rates our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue 

ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of one of the larger carriers in the market as well as multiple mergers and acquisitions as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and improve their financial results additionally while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity consequently when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

there is uncertainty as to how changes in oil prices will impact future buy rates because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both our cargo space buy rates and sell rates to customers we would expect our gross revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to change we would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from future movements in oil prices 

the global economic environment and trade growth remain uncertain we cannot predict what impact this may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our business 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies tax liabilities and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

we are subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments management believes our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course expeditors is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in additional tax payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimates 

as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report we account for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under our stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields historically we have used the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon our historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

our expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option the expected dividend yield is based on our historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update asu simplifying the accounting for stock compensation the asu requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated statements of earnings when our stock options are exercised or canceled and for disqualifying dispositions of shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan all taxrelated cash flows are required to be reported as operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows we will adopt this asu on a prospective basis beginning on january 1 2017 we have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur in determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period we believe the adoption of this asu will result in volatility in our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share due to the recording of all of the tax effects of sharebased payments in our consolidated statements of earnings the volatility in future periods will be dependent upon our stock price stock option exercise and cancellation activity and the amount of disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased by our employees under our employee stock purchase plan had the standard been effective in 2016 and 2015 it would have resulted in 27 million of additional tax expense and a 11 million tax benefit respectively 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an asu amending existing revenue recognition guidance and requiring related detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this asu is effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 we formed a crossfunctional project team that is in the process of evaluating the adoption impacts of the asu for each of our products and services this process though underway is not yet completed and our understanding of the future adoption impacts including any potential changes related to principal and agent determinations on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of the asu have not yet been determined our project team is also assessing how our current processes and systems may be impacted by adoption we have yet to decide whether we will adopt under a cumulative effect or retrospective method at this time based on the nature of our operations we do not believe that the adoption of the asu will have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognized or our revenue recognition policies however we have not yet completed our full assessment we expect to complete our assessment of the impact towards the end of 2017 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu changing the accounting for leases and including a requirement to record all leases on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities the asu will be effective for us beginning on january 1 2019 and will be adopted using a modified retrospective transition adoption of the asu will impact our consolidated balance sheets as future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases totaled 214 million  as of december 31 2016 we are currently evaluating the full impact that the adoption of this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

results of operations 

the following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to our principal services and our expenses for 2016  2015  and 2014  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned by expeditors as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to us for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by expeditors in our other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by us net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to manage sell rates to customers with our ability to concentrate and leverage our purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services

the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report

2016  compared with 2015   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues decreased 10 in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of lowering average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions the decrease in average sell rates was partially offset by a 3 growth in airfreight tonnage airfreight services expenses decreased 12 in 2016  as compared with 2015  as a result of favorable buying opportunities throughout most regions due primarily to excess available carrier capacity while not possible to quantify sell rates and tonnage were favorably impacted in 2015 by customers converting a portion of their ocean freight shipments to airfreight due to port disruptions on the us west coast 

airfreight services net revenues in 2016  decreased 7 as compared with 2015  the decrease was principally due to a 12 decrease in net revenue per kilo partially offset by a 3 increase in tonnage average net revenue per kilo declined in most regions primarily due to competitive market conditions and rapid changes in carrier pricing caused by sporadic increases in demand north america net revenues decreased by 6 due principally to a 3 decrease in tonnage north asia south asia and europe net revenues decreased 10 9 and 2 respectively despite tonnage increases of 5 7 and 3 

aside from temporary disruptions such as those experienced with us west coast ports in 2015 we expect the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands historically we have experienced lower airfreight margins in the fourth quarter as seasonal volumes increase and carriers correspondingly increase buy rates these events should they continue to occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues decreased 13 in 2016  as compared with 2015  as we continued to lower average sell rates to customers in response to competitive market conditions and lower available buy rates from carriers although average sell rates to customers declined container volumes increased 3 ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 16 in 2016  as compared with 2015  due to lower average buy rates resulting from carrier overcapacity 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2016  as compared with 2015  the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 48 and 50 of ocean freight net revenue in 2016  and 2015  respectively 

  22  

ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 6 in 2016  as compared with 2015  this decrease was due primarily to an 8 decrease in net revenue per container partially offset by a 3 increase in volume during the latter part of the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a spike in average buy rates that began with the bankruptcy of a large ocean carrier on august 31 2016 direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues decreased 2 due to lower volumes principally in north america order management net revenues increased 11 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north asia and south asia 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 3 in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily due to lower direct ocean forwarding volumes and a decrease in ocean freight consolidation resulting from declining margins on imports north asia net revenues decreased 1 as lower margins offset the 1 growth in volume europe net revenues decreased 4 as lower direct ocean forwarding volumes more than offset growth from order management and ocean freight consolidation south asia net revenues increased 6 due principally to 4 growth in volumes 

we expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers increasingly solicit bids and carriers react to current market conditions including carrier liquidity challenges such as the bankruptcy filing of a large ocean carrier that occurred in august 2016 and realignment of carrier alliances these conditions could result in lower revenues and yields 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 3 and 1 respectively in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of increased volumes from existing and new road freight customers 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 4 in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in road freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 5 in 2016  as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in road freight and lower import service costs north asia net revenues increased 8 due primarily to growth in import and warehouse and distribution services europe net revenues remained constant as compared with 2015  

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 1 in 2016  as compared with 2015  principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe partially offset by reduced bonuses from lower operating income 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2016  were down 7 as compared with 2015  primarily as a result of a 7 decrease in operating income our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs increased to 53  of net revenues in 2016 as compared with 52  in 2015 

because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers due to the nature of our services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs 

other overhead expenses increased 4 in 2016  as compared with 2015  the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher rent and maintenance costs and technology fees partially offset by lower claims in the current year other overhead expenses increased to 16  of net revenues in 2016  as compared with 15  in 2015  

income tax expense 

we pay income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions our consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 370  in 2016  as compared with 376  in 2015  the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower 

  23  

2015  compared with 2014   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues decreased 1 in 2015  as compared with 2014  due primarily to lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america europe and north asia partially offset by a 6 growth in tonnage airfreight services expenses decreased 6 in 2015  as compared with 2014  as a result of favorable spot and general market buying opportunities in 2015 partially offset by costs attributable to the increase in tonnage 

airfreight services net revenues in 2015 increased 11 as compared with 2014 the increase was principally due to a 6 improvement in airfreight tonnage and a 9 increase in net revenue per kilo north america net revenues increased by 8 due to 4 growth in export tonnage and lower average buy rates from favorable buying opportunities north asia net revenues increased 24 this was also due to favorable buying opportunities in 2015 which resulted in a 19 increase in net revenue per kilo on an 8 improvement in export tonnage south asia net revenues increased 27 primarily due to an 11 increase in tonnage and the same buying opportunities in the second half of 2015 europe net revenues decreased 7 primarily due to a 7 reduction in net revenue per kilo 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 1 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as container volumes increased 3 while average sell rates to customers were lower in the first half of 2014 we implemented sell rate reductions to increase container volume beginning in september 2014 and continuing through the first quarter of 2015 we maintained higher average rates in response to overall market conditions we decreased average sell rates during the last nine months of 2015 in response to lower overall market demand and growth in carrier capacity 

ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 4 in 2015 as compared with 2014 due to favorable market buying opportunities that resulted from a decline in overall market demand coupled with growth in carrier capacity 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2015 as compared with 2014 in 2015 and 2014 the majority of our ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 45 respectively of ocean freight net revenue 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 31 in 2015 as compared with 2014 this increase was due primarily to a 27 increase in net revenue per container and a 3 growth in container volume we changed our pricing strategies as described above in the third quarter of 2014 which combined with favorable market buying opportunities in the last nine months of 2015 led to improved yields 

direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 8 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as a result of higher volumes principally in north america europe and north asia order management net revenues increased 7 in 2015 as compared with 2014 mostly due to higher volumes from existing customers and new business primarily in north and south asia 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 17 in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to improved margins europe net revenues increased 16 primarily due to a 10 improvement in volumes and an increase in direct ocean forwarding north asia net revenues increased 21 principally due to improved margins and growth in order management 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 5 and 3 respectively in 2015 as compared with 2014 as a result of increased volumes from existing and new customers 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 6 in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in north america customers continued to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 10 in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers europe net revenues decreased 4 as compared with 2014 due to general market conditions 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 7 in 2015 as compared with 2014 principally as a result of increased bonuses resulting from higher operating income and an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe 

bonuses to field and executive management in 2015 were up 18 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of a 21 increase in operating income salaries and related costs decreased 2 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 as compared with 2014 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from higher headcount and bonuses 

other overhead expenses remained flat in 2015 as compared with 2014 lower depreciation expense recovery of legal and related costs and a reduction in indirect taxes were partially offset by higher travel related costs technology consulting fees and claims other overhead expenses decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 as compared with 2014 

income tax expense 

our consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 376  in 2015  as compared to 379  in 2014  the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2016  2015  and 2014  was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  in both 2016  and 2015  and 2 million  in 2014  

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 529 million  as compared with 565 million  for 2015  this 36 million  decrease is primarily due to lower earnings and changes in working capital at december 31 2016  working capital was 1289 million  including cash and cash equivalents of 974 million  we had no longterm debt at december 31 2016  management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

as a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and tax to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 53 million  as compared with 7 million  for 2015  we had minor net purchases of investments in 2016  compared to receiving net proceeds from maturity of shortterm investments of 40 million in 2015  we had capital expenditures of 59 million  in 2016  as compared with 44 million  in 2015  capital expenditures in 2016  related primarily to continuing investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements occasionally we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight in 2016 we completed a land acquisition in europe for which funds had been deposited into escrow in 2014 additional expenditures are expected to be made in 2017 and 2018 in connection with the construction of a building on this land total anticipated capital expenditures in 2017  are currently estimated to be 110 million this includes routine capital expenditures including the construction of the building in europe plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 298 million  as compared with 635 million  in 2015  we used the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to limit the growth in issued and outstanding shares during 2016  and 2015  we used cash to repurchase 7 million and 13 million shares of common stock respectively during 2016  and 2015  we paid dividends of 080  and 072  per share respectively 

we have a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises during 2016  we repurchased 34 million  shares at an average price of  5046  per share we also have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 170 million  shares of common stock during 2016  we repurchased 32 million  shares at an average price of 5061  per share see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans 

  25  

we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and political uncertainty may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

we maintain international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2016  we were contingently liable for 64 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



at december 31 2016  our contractual obligations are as follows 



we typically enter into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill historically we have met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2016  will be fulfilled during 2017  in the ordinary course of business also in october 2016 we entered into a contractual agreement to construct a building in europe that is currently expected to cost 51 million €45 million 

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalent balances of 504 million  were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which 73 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been established for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

impact of inflation 

to date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an 

  26  

average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2016  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 47 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 39 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2016  was insignificant net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  in both 2016  and 2015  and were 2 million  in 2014  we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2016  we had 11 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 974 million  of which 568 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2016  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2016  would not have a significant impact on our earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2016  and 2015  




 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are developing a new accounting system which is being implemented on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness 

our management has confidence in our internal controls and procedures nevertheless our management including expeditors’ chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all of our control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2016  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  which is included on page f2

the expeditors network

strategic initiatives 

in 2015 expeditors implemented key strategic initiatives that were developed in late 2014 by the company’s executive team those operational initiatives are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings per share growth 

the strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors’ teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that the company can continue to differentiate itself from its competitors 

the company continues to be focused on growth based on four key strategic initiatives 

 in addition the company also has implemented four “enabling” initiatives which while also strategic in scope are highly tactical in support of the main four strategic initiatives 

 globally consistent information systems built specifically for logistics 

expeditors has long believed it a competitive advantage to maintain a globally consistent it system designed and built by logistics professionals for logistics professionals the company’s it systems were built on a foundation that dictated consistency and uniformity across the expeditors global network for scalability the company’s systems were designed on a decentralized basis so that an interruption in one office or location would likely not debilitate the abilities of the entire network or even a significant subpart of the network 

expeditors’ it systems were designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of the company’s own logistics industry professionals and own staff building and maintaining internal system capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that the company not outsource its core functions with information systems being one of those core functions 

expeditors is not dependent on third parties for upgrades or modifications to its systems whether to address company needs or those of its customers even as the company is constantly engaged in enhancing and improving its systems expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected system providing comprehensive visibility creates great efficiency and great value particularly in this era when the value of data and the ability to provide timely visibility to that data in a consistent and reliable format is increasingly important 

organic versus acquired growth 

as a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services expeditors has often concluded over the course of its history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition the company’s two primary strategies for expansion are to open offices in response to client requests and to expand through jointventures with agents when the company has made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage and specialized industry expertise that it was lacking and that could be leveraged to benefit the company’s entire network nevertheless despite its history of organic growth expeditors is not opposed to acquisitions and will continue to identify and assess desirable acquisitions 

  3  

tailored solutions and targeted marketing 

as a nonasset based organization expeditors has considerable flexibility in managing its customers supply chains because of its relationships with local suppliers and global air and ocean partners expeditors is able to provide each of its customers with routing and pricing expertise the company’s logistics solutions are tailored to each of its customer’s individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer typically chooses a logistics company and services for what’s being shipped the foreign shipper may also be involved in the selection process accordingly expeditors targets its marketing to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

because expeditors is in the business of optimizing its customers’ supply chains the company focuses its marketing to reach professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and operations in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

leveraging global regional and local expertise 

expeditors staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling expeditors’ services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that this regional expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating the origin and destination of customer service and marketing activities and its incentivebased compensation program that rewards employees based on the performance of the operations they control have been important elements of the company’s success 

what expeditors ships 

the goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment pharmaceutical products retail goods automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of company business the typical import customer includes retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers expeditors also has established industry vertical teams throughout its network to focus on aviation and aerospace healthcare oil and energy and retail and fashion historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of company net revenues 

expeditors services in detail 

the following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors’ services 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 41 percent of total company revenues and 34  percent of total net revenues in each of the last three years when performing airfreight services expeditors typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator expeditors purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment expeditors issues a house airway bill hawb to its customers as the contract of carriage and separately receives a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation expeditors receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent expeditors offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight operations expeditors receives shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point expeditors or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates that its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

at the origin the company typically delivers shipments from one of its warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours from the point of origin during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist expeditors may charter aircrafts to meet customer demand 

expeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment expeditors is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

expeditors’ airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges the company and the rate that expeditors in turn charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services expeditors provides include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when expeditors acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  4  

expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with its service providers  the airlines because expeditors relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments its business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service 

  

although airline profitability has improved over the last two years many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products companies continue to decrease the size and weight of shipments and many of the companys customers focus on improving supplychain efficiency seek to reduce overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizie ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings for its customers the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

declines in fuel prices did not significantly impact airfreight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 airfreight customers began to seek reductions in rates related to lower fuel prices and currently carriers are incorporating the lower fuel rates into their pricing structures there continues to be uncertainty as to how future buy rates will be impacted by continuing volatility in fuel prices due to a number of factors because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts the companys buy and sell rates expeditors would expect its airfreight revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the impact of changing fuel prices the company would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from any changes in fuel prices 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 33 percent of the companys total revenues and 25  percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years the company operates expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 

ocean freight consolidation    as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean the company issues a house ocean bill hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that the company may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when the customer contracts directly with the steamship line the company acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the steamship line and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements the company does not issue an hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs the company to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management    order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new ships which creates excess capacity this excess capacity causes most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

recent declines in oil prices have been reflected in both the buy and sell rates for ocean freight via a surcharge known as the bunker adjustment factor this surcharge in the industry fluctuates with the cost of the bunker fuel and is added to base ocean freight charges the company would not expect an adverse effect on ocean freight net revenues resulting from changes in oil prices 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 26 percent of the companys total revenues and 41  percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years as a customs broker expeditors assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service expeditors provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles in its transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments handled by the company may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  5  

expeditors also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinite transportation services transcon and consulting services none of which are currently individually significant to the company’s total revenues and net revenues expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between customers’ service providers and expeditors systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near realtime visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

expeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet its customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in its ongoing success the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that currently meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel expeditors believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide a distinct competitive advantage 

currency and dependence on service providers 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates that it transacts in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this exposes expeditors to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where expeditors maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations that influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies expeditors considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect expeditors business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can expeditors estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2016  

  6

regulation and security 

with respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states the company is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa expeditors overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation expeditors is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices the company has applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata members 

expeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which the company does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in 2016 cbp is upgrading its system to the automated commercial environment ace expeditors is in the process of upgrading its systems to comply with the new ace requirements however there can be no assurance that there will not be resulting delays or disruptions in other jurisdictions in which the company performs customs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries 

  8  

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to expeditors ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when expeditors encounters this sort of governmental restriction the company works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global threats from terrorism wars and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents expeditors and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company believes that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the companys services 

cargo liability

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company the companys services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own or operate transportation assets 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes 

  16  

in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of the companys three primary sources of revenue 

in most cases the company acts as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions the company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally when the company is the primary obligor it is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier has credit risk or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where the company is not primarily obligated and does not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination of thereof 

for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company does not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise acts solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company is managed along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the network 

  17  

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each region in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs north asia is the companys largest export oriented region and accounted for 39  of revenues 23  of net revenues and 34  of operating income for the year ended december 31 2015  north asias operating income as a percentage of revenue is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

expeditors culture 

from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key nonexecutive manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

the company believes that any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company quite possibly provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond its control the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism and increased governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt the ocean steamship line industry has incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

international trade and competition 

the company operates in 63 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the company’s pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers we expect these competitive conditions to continue 

  18  

currently there is uncertainty as to how declines in oil prices will impact future buy rates due to a number of factors including that some carriers have hedged fuel costs because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its gross revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices the company would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from changes in oil prices 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies tax liabilities and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

the company is subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report earnings of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments the company believes its tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course the company is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in the company owing additional taxes the company establishes liabilities when despite its belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law it concludes that it may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors the company’s estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction the company believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of its tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimates 

as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical 

  19  

experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update asu amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring related detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the asu on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures however at this time based on the nature of the companys operations the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognized or the companys revenue recognition policies 

in november 2015 the fasb issued an asu simplifying the accounting for income taxes by requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted the asu may be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively the company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and expects this asu will have an impact on its consolidated balance sheets as its current deferred tax assets were 17 million  and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were 26 million  as of december 31 2015 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu changing the accounting for leases and including a requirement to record all leases on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities the asu is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2019 adoption of the asu will impact the company’s consolidated balance sheets as future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases totaled 131 million  as of december 31 2015 the company is currently evaluating the full impact that the adoption of this asu will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

results of operations 

the following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2015  2014  and 2013  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by the company net revenue is one of the companys primary operational and financial measures that demonstrates the ability of the company to manage sell rates to customers with its ability to concentrate and leverage its purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services

the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report 



  21  

2015  compared with 2014   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues decreased 1 in 2015  as compared with 2014  due primarily to lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america europe and north asia partially offset by a 6 growth in tonnage airfreight services expenses decreased 6 in 2015  as compared with 2014  as a result of favorable spot and general market buying opportunities in 2015 partially offset by costs attributable to the increase in tonnage 

airfreight services net revenues in 2015  increased 11 as compared with 2014  the increase was principally due to a 6 improvement in airfreight tonnage and a 9 increase in net revenue per kilo north america net revenues increased by 8 due to 4 growth in export tonnage and lower average buy rates from favorable buying opportunities north asia net revenues increased 24 this was also due to favorable buying opportunities in 2015 which resulted in a 19 increase in net revenue per kilo on an 8 improvement in export tonnage south asia net revenues increased 27 primarily due to an 11 increase in tonnage and the same buying opportunities in the second half of 2015 europe net revenues decreased 7 primarily due to a 7 reduction in net revenue per kilo 

aside from temporary disruptions such as those experienced with us west coast ports the company expects the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity changes in the cost of jet fuel and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the company expects these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands these events should they occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 1 in 2015  as compared with 2014  as container volumes increased 3 while average sell rates to customers were lower in the first half of 2014 the company implemented sell rate reductions to increase container volume beginning in september 2014 and continuing through the first quarter of 2015 the company maintained higher average rates in response to overall market conditions the company decreased average sell rates during the last nine months of 2015 in response to lower overall market demand and growth in carrier capacity 

ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 4 in 2015  as compared with 2014  due to favorable market buying opportunities that resulted from a decline in overall market demand coupled with growth in carrier capacity 

  22  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2015  as compared with 2014  the largest component of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 45 of ocean freight net revenue in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 31 in 2015  as compared with 2014  this increase was due primarily to a 27 increase in net revenue per container and a 3 growth in container volume the company changed its pricing strategies as described above in the third quarter of 2014 which combined with favorable market buying opportunities in the last nine months of 2015 led to improved yields the company expects pricing volatility to continue as customers and carriers react to current market conditions which could result in reduced yields 

direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 8 in 2015  as compared with 2014  as a result of higher volumes principally in north america europe and north asia order management net revenues increased 7 in 2015  as compared with 2014  mostly due to higher volumes from existing customers and new business primarily in north and south asia 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 17 in 2015  as compared with 2014  primarily due to improved margins europe net revenues increased 16 primarily due to a 10 improvement in volumes and an increase in direct ocean forwarding north asia net revenues increased 21 principally due to improved margins and growth in order management 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 5 and 3 respectively in 2015  as compared with 2014  as a result of increased volumes from existing and new customers 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 6 in 2015  as compared with 2014  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in north america customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america net revenues increased 10 in 2015  as compared with 2014  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers europe net revenues decreased 4 as compared with 2014  due to general market conditions 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 7 in 2015  as compared with 2014  principally as a result of increased bonuses resulting from higher operating income and an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2015  were up 18 as compared with 2014  primarily as a result of a 21 increase in operating income the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs decreased 2 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 as compared with 2014 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from higher headcount and bonuses 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses remained flat in 2015  as compared with 2014  lower depreciation expense recovery of legal and related costs and a reduction in indirect taxes were partially offset by higher travel related costs technology consulting fees and claims other overhead expenses decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015  as compared with 2014  

income tax expense 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 376  in 2015  as compared with 379  in 2014  the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of a higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs the companys effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower 

  23  

2014  compared with 2013   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues increased 6 in 2014  as compared with 2013  due to a 9 increase in tonnage that was partially offset by lower sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america north asia and south asia airfreight services expenses increased 5 in 2014  as compared with 2013  as the increase in tonnage was slightly offset by negotiating lower buy rates with carriers primarily on exports from north america north asia and south asia 

airfreight services net revenues in 2014  increased 6 as compared with 2013  the increase was principally due to a 9 improvement in airfreight tonnage partially offset by a 3 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america export tonnage grew by 14 while net revenues increased by only 8 as the reduction in average sell rates to customers exceeded the reduction in average buy rates negotiated with carriers europe net revenues increased 17 primarily due to a 23 growth in export tonnage as a result of new customers north asia net revenues remained flat the 2 growth in export tonnage in north asia was offset by lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions which resulted in a 2 reduction in net revenue per kilo south asia net revenues decreased by 1 as the 12 growth in export tonnage was more than offset by a reduction in net revenue per kilo the reduction in net revenue per kilo resulted from lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 11 in 2014  as compared with 2013  due primarily to an 11 increase in container volume in the first half of 2014 the company implemented sell rate reductions to increase container volume during the second half of 2014 average rates increased due to higher overall demand in the marketplace ocean freight and ocean services expenses increased 13 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily as the result of the increase in volume and higher costs in ocean freight consolidation 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 6 in 2014  as compared with 2013  in 2014  and 2013  the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 45 and 46 respectively of ocean freight net revenue 

ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 4 in 2014  as compared with 2013  this increase was due primarily to an 11 growth in container volume largely offset by the effect of reducing sell rates principally in the first half of 2014 this resulted in a 6 decrease in net revenue per kilo primarily in north america north asia and south asia

customs brokerage and other services

north america north asia and europe net revenues increased 6 6 and 4 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 3 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in north america and europe and higher base salaries in 2014 the company benefited from a reduction in expense resulting from favorable claims experience in its employee healthcare selfinsurance program 

bonuses to executive management in 2014  were down 2 as compared with 2013  primarily as a result of a reduction in the 2014 bonus pool to recoup the retirement bonus expensed in 2013 for peter j rose the companys former chairman and chief executive officer excluding the recovery of the retirement bonus bonuses to executive management increased 7 salaries and related costs decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 as compared with 2013 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from the increase in the number of employees and higher base salaries

income tax expense 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 379  in 2014  as compared to 389  in 2013  the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of an increasingly higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2015  2014  and 2013  was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014  net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  and 2 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively foreign currency losses were 2 million  in 2013  

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than the company however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 565 million  as compared with 395 million  for 2014  this 170 million  increase is primarily due to higher earnings and changes in working capital at december 31 2015  working capital was 1132 million  including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 808 million  the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2015  management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and tax to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria the company has agreed to extend payment terms beyond its customary terms management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 7 million  as compared with 79 million  for 2014  the company received net proceeds from investments of 40 million in 2015  compared to net investments in shortterm investments of 14 million in 2014  the company had capital expenditures of 44 million  in 2015  as compared with 37 million  in 2014  capital expenditures in 2015  related primarily to continuing investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight during the second quarter of 2014 the company deposited 27 million in an escrow account for an expected land acquisition total anticipated capital expenditures in 2016  are currently estimated to be 100 million this includes routine capital expenditures plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 635 million  as compared with 606 million  in 2014  the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase company common stock on the open market to limit the growth in issued and outstanding shares during both 2015  and 2014  the company used cash to repurchase 13 million shares of common stock during 2015  and 2014  the company paid dividends of 072  per share and 064  per share respectively 

  25  

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises during 2015  the company repurchased 2796915  shares at an average price of  4802  per share the company also has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 180 million  shares of common stock during 2015  the company repurchased 10342167  shares at an average price of 4793  per share see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans 

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2015  the company was contingently liable for 76 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



at december 31 2015  the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 



the company enters into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill historically the company has met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2015  will be fulfilled during 2016  in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the companys foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2015  cash and cash equivalent balances of 536 million  were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 49 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been accrued for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  26  

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2015  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 54 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 44 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2015  was insignificant net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million  and 2 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively net foreign currency losses were 2 million  in 2013  the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014  the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2015  the company had less than 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2015  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 808 million  of which 362 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2015  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2015  would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2015  and 2014

 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  27  

the companys management has confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

the company is developing a new accounting system which it is implementing on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition affects the processes that constitute the companys internal control over financial reporting and requires testing for operating effectiveness 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2015  the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective

 item 1—business 

expeditors international of washington inc the company is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services the company offers its customers a seamless international network of people and integrated information systems supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods the company’s primary services include air and ocean freight transportation and customs brokerage the company also provides additional services including order management timedefinite transportation warehousing and distribution cargo insurance and customized logistics solutions as a third party logistics provider the company purchases cargo space from carriers including airlines and ocean shipping lines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships the following charts show the companys 2014 revenues and net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses by service type 

     

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and equity attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 42 percent of the companys total revenues and 34  percent of total net revenues in each of the last three years when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment the company issues a house airway bill hawb to its customers as its contract of carriage and separately receives a master airway bill from the airlines when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight operations the company receives shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may adversely affect its business 

  

over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and as customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency seek to reduce overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and by utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

recent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact airfreight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 airfreight customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors including that some air carriers having hedged fuel costs through 2015 presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its airfreight revenues and costs to decline should lower fuel prices persist the company would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from a decline in oil prices 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 33 percent of the companys total revenues and 23  percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years the company operates expeditors international ocean inc “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 

  2  

ocean freight consolidation    as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not want to contract directly with the ocean carriers and for those customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company issues a house ocean bill hobl to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

direct ocean forwarding    when the customer contracts directly with the steamship line the company acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the steamship line and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements no hobl is issued by the company the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs the company to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipper 

order management    order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new ships which creates excess capacity this excessive capacity causes most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

recent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact ocean freight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 ocean freight customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its ocean freight revenues and costs to decline should lower fuel prices persist the company would not expect an adverse effect on ocean freight net revenues resulting from a decline in oil prices 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 25 percent of the companys total revenues and 43  percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles in its transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments handled by the company may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinite transportation services transcon and consulting services none of which are currently individually significant to the company’s total revenues and net revenues the companys distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects

the company provides specific solutions tailored to each customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s efforts are focused on optimizing its customers’ supply chains therefore the companys marketing efforts target professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and operations in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment pharmaceutical products retail goods automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers the company has also established industry vertical teams located throughout its network that focus on aviation and aerospace healthcare oil and energy and retail and fashion historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between customers’ service providers and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that currently meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage 

currency and dependence on service providers 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2015  

employees 

at january 31 2015  the company employed approximately 14670  people 5290  in the united states and 990  in the balance of north america 760  in latin america 3780  in asia pacific 2510  in europe and 1340  in the middle east africa and india the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united 

  6  

states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs customs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global terrorist threat and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments 

when providing ground transportation services as a carrier the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value generally 050 per pound though the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent 

when providing warehousing and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 

in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2014  was 5 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company the companys services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own or operate transportation assets 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of the companys three primary sources of revenue 

  14  

in most cases the company acts as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions the company is the primary obligor and is required to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier and has credit risk the company is the principal in these transactions and reports revenue and the related expenses on a gross basis 

for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company does not issue a hawb or a hobl or otherwise acts solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the network 

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each region in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs the asia pacific segment is the companys largest export oriented region and accounted for 49  of revenues and 39  of operating income for the year 

  15  

ended december 31 2014  asia pacifics operating income as a percentage of revenue is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

strategy and culture 

the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating lossesmanagement must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond its control the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism and increased governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt the ocean steamship line industry has incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

in 2014 the company completed a comprehensive strategic assessment of its market positions and organizational structures the primary purpose of the strategic assessment is to focus managements expertise to create an environment where the company will be both unified and confident in allocating its resources in areas that maximize the total returns to its stakeholders the companys strategic assessment has resulted in the following four basic broad key strategic initiatives 

   16  

international trade and competition 

the company operates in 63 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs rising costs in general disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the company’s pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers which has resulted in a compression of the companys unitary margins during 2014 we expect these competitive conditions to continue 

recent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors including that some carriers having hedged fuel costs through 2015 presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its gross revenues and costs to decline should lower fuel prices persist the company would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from a decline in oil prices 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

the company is subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report earnings of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves judgment the company believes its tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course the company is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in the company owing additional taxes the company establishes liabilities when despite its belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law it concludes that it may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the company’s estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely 

  17  

outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction the company believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of its tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimates 

as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

results of operations 

the following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2014  2013  and 2012  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by the company net revenue is one of the companys primary operational and financial measures that demonstrates the ability of the company to manage sell rates to customers with its ability to concentrate and leverage its purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services

2014  compared with 2013   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues increased 6 in 2014  as compared with 2013  due to a 9 increase in tonnage that was partially offset by lower sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america and asia pacific airfreight services expenses increased 5 in 2014  as compared with 2013  as the increase in tonnage was slightly offset by negotiating lower buy rates with carriers primarily on exports from north america and asia pacific 

airfreight services net revenues in 2014  increased 6 as compared with 2013  the increase was principally due to a 9 improvement in airfreight tonnage partially offset by a 3 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america export tonnage grew by 14 while net revenues increased by only 8 as the reduction in average sell rates to customers exceeded the reduction in average buy rates negotiated with carriers europe net revenues increased 17 primarily due to a 23 growth in export tonnage as a result of new customers asia pacific net revenues remained flat the 4 growth in export tonnage in asia pacific was offset by lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions which resulted in a 4 reduction in net revenue per kilo 

the company expects the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the company expects these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands these factors create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell rates 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 11 in 2014  as compared with 2013  due primarily to an 11 increase in container volume in the first half of 2014 the company implemented sell rate reductions to maintain existing customers and grow market share during the second half of 2014 average rates increased due to higher overall demand in the marketplace ocean freight and ocean services expenses increased 13 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily as the result of the increase in volume and higher costs in ocean freight consolidation container volume is measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 6 in 2014  as compared with 2013  ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the largest component of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 45 and 46 of ocean freight net revenue in 2014  and 2013  respectively 

  20  

ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 4 in 2014  as compared with 2013  this increase was due primarily to an 11 growth in container volume largely offset by the effect of reducing sell rates principally in the first half of 2014 this resulted in a 6 decrease in net revenue per kilo primarily in north america and asia pacific 

direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 6 in 2014  as compared with 2013  as a result of higher volumes principally in north america asia pacific and europe order management net revenues increased 9 in 2014  as compared with 2013  due to additional services and volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north america the overall margins in order management declined due to higher costs primarily in asia pacific 

north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 7 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily due to an increase in ocean freight consolidation in the second half of the year and growth in order management europe net revenues increased 4 primarily due to an increase in direct ocean forwarding asia pacific net revenues increased 5 due primarily to an increase in both direct ocean forwarding and ocean freight consolidation volumes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 8 and 12 respectively in 2014  as compared with 2013  as a result of increased volumes from existing and new customers and higher costs in import and delivery services 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 4 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in north america the margin percentage declined primarily as a result of higher import costs and lower yields in timedefinite transcon services customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america asia pacific and europe net revenues increased 6 1 and 4 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 3 in 2014  as compared with 2013  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in north america and europe and higher base salaries in 2014 the company benefited from a reduction in expense resulting from favorable claims experience in its employee healthcare selfinsurance program 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to executive management in 2014  were down 2 as compared with 2013  primarily as a result of a reduction in the 2014 bonus pool to recoup the retirement bonus expensed in 2013 for peter j rose the companys former chairman and chief executive officer excluding the recovery of the retirement bonus bonuses to executive management increased 7 the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 as compared with 2013 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from the increase in the number of employees and higher base salaries 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 8 in 2014  as compared with 2013  the increase in expenses is primarily due to i consulting fees and costs associated with the companys strategic assessment and organizational changes ii higher costs related to investments in software and systems iii increased building maintenance and warehousing costs iv higher travel costs and v higher business taxes partially offset by a recovery of bad debt expense and reduced legal and claims costs other overhead expenses remained constant as a percentage of net revenues in 2014  as compared with 2013  

income tax expense 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 379  in 2014  as compared with 389  in 2013  the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of an increasingly higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock options grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs

2013  compared with 2012   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues and related expenses in 2013  both increased 1 as compared with 2012  a 4 increase in tonnage was offset by lower sell and buy rates that reflected continued soft market conditions primarily caused by higher available capacity relative to demand and effective carrier utilization by the company 

airfreight services net revenues in 2013  increased 4 as compared with 2012  the increase in airfreight services net revenues was principally due to a 4 increase in airfreight tonnage while net revenue per kilo remained relatively constant

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses both decreased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily driven by lower sell rates to customers and buy rates from carriers reflecting increased carrier capacity that outpaced overall market demand the decreases in sell and buy rates were partially offset by a 6 increase in container volumes in 2013  as compared with 2012  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily resulting from additional services and volumes with new and existing customers utilizing order management services 

in 2013  and 2012  the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 46 and 47 respectively of ocean freight net revenue ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily due to a 7 decrease in net revenue per container offset by a 6 increase in container volume in 2013 ocean carriers attempted on several occasions throughout the year to increase prices ultimately these efforts were relatively unsuccessful and market ocean rates fell in the face of ongoing capacity issues in order to maintain and grow market share the company reacted to these market trends by temporarily absorbing carrier cost increases when the company anticipated such cost increases would be temporary and could not be sustained by the carriers the company also implemented rate reductions with its customers where needed to reflect market conditions mostly on exports from china 

order management net revenues increased 6 in 2013  as compared with 2012  due to additional services and volumes with new and existing customers direct ocean freight forwarding remained flat in 2013  as compared with 2012  

north america and europe ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 3 an d 2  respectively while asia pacific ocean freight net revenues decreased by 2 in 2013  as compared with 2012 the decrease in net revenues in asia pacific is due to the company implementing sell rate reductions to customers primarily in the second half of 2013 which on average outpaced buy rate reductions negotiated with carriers and was partially offset by a 15 increase in container volume 

customs brokerage and other services

income tax expense 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 389  in 2013  as compared to 395  in 2012  the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to lower nondeductible expenses as compared to the prior year period and less of a negative impact in the current year period associated with the companys stockbased compensation arrangements when compared to the prior year period 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2014  2013  and 2012  was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2014  and 2013  net foreign currency losses were approximately 4 million  3 million  and 9 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than the company however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial condition 

larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 395 million  as compared with 408 million  for 2013  this 13 million  decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts partially offset by higher earnings at december 31 2014  working capital was 1305 million  including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 967 million  the company had no debt at december 31 2014  management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria the company has agreed to extend payment terms beyond its customary terms management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 79 million  as compared with 77 million  for 2013  the company made net investments in shortterm investments of 14 million and 26 million in 2014  and 2013  respectively the company had capital expenditures of 37 million  in 2014  as compared with 53 million  in 2013  capital expenditures in 2014  related primarily to continuing investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight during the second quarter of 2014 the company deposited 27 million in an escrow account for an expected land acquisition total anticipated capital expenditures in 2015  are currently estimated to be 85 million this includes routine capital expenditures plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 606 million  as compared with 332 million  in 2013  the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase company common stock on the open market to limit the growth in issued and outstanding shares also the company used cash to repurchase additional common stock of 110 million and 38 million shares in 2014  and 2013  respectively to reduce the number of total shares outstanding in 2013 the company purchased the 

  23  

noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary during 2014  and 2013  the company paid dividends of 064  per share and 060  per share respectively 

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2014  the company had repurchased and retired 27433977  shares of common stock at an average price of  2550  per share over the period from 1994 through 2014  during 2014  1525827  shares were repurchased at an average price of  4300  per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 190000000  shares of common stock as of december 31 2014  the company had repurchased and retired 44129166  shares of common stock at an average price of 3812  per share over the period from 2001 through 2014  during 2014  11572236  shares were repurchased at an average price of 4193  per share on february 24 2015 the plan was amended by the board of directors to authorize management to reduce issued and outstanding stock to 188000000  shares of common stock 

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2014  the company was contingently liable for 74 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



at december 31 2014  the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 



the company enters into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2014  will be fulfilled during 2015  in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the companys foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2014  cash and cash equivalent balances of 565 million  were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 52 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been accrued for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014  the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british pound 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2014  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 42 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 35 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2014  was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 4 million  3 million  and 9 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2014  and 2013  the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2014  the company had approximately 27 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2014  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 967 million  of which 436 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2014  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2014  would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2014  and 2013

 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the companys management has confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

the company is developing a new accounting system which it is implementing on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition will affect the processes that constitute the companys internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for operating effectiveness 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2014  the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective

 item 1—business 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services the company offers its customers a seamless international network supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods the company’s services include the consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight in each united states full service office and in many overseas offices the company acts as a customs broker the company also provides additional services including order management timedefinite transportation warehousing and distribution cargo insurance and customized logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships 

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

at january 31 2014 the company including its majorityowned subsidiaries is organized functionally in geographic operating segments and operates full service offices in the regions identified below full service offices have also been established in locations where the company maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock 

the company operates full service offices in the following geographic regions 

 the company also maintains sales and satellite offices which are aligned with and dependent on one or more full service offices additionally the company contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has established 44 such relationships worldwide 

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and equity attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 43 43 47 percent of the companys total revenues and 34  34  and 37  percent of total net revenues in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment the company issues a house airway bill hawb to its customers as its contract of carriage and separately receives a master airway bill from the airlines when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight operations the company receives shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2600 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  1  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may adversely affect its business 

  

the commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial operating losses in recent years while their operations have improved many airlines remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 32 33 30 percent of the companys total revenues and 23  24  and 23  percent of total net revenues in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean inc “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not want to contract directly with the ocean carriers and for those customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company issues a house ocean bill hobl to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 

when the customer contracts directly with the steamship line the company acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the steamship line and handling fees paid by the customer 

order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers 

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers took delivery of new ships which created excess capacity this excessive capacity caused most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 25 24 23 percent of the companys total revenues and 43  42  and 40  percent of total net revenues in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles in its transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments handled by the company may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  2  

the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinite transportation services and consulting services none of which are currently individually significant to the company’s total revenues and net revenues the companys distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

marketing and customers 

the company provides specific solutions tailored to each customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s efforts are focused on optimizing its customers’ supply chains therefore the companys marketing efforts target professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and operations in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment retail goods automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers the company has also established industry vertical teams located throughout its network that focus on aviation and aerospace healthcare oil and energy and retail and fashion historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between customers’ service providers and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that currently meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage

currency and dependence on service providers 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2014  

employees 

at january 31 2014  the company employed approximately 13910  people 4940  in the united states and 840  in the balance of north america 700  in latin america 3930  in asia pacific 2280  in europe and africa and 1220  in the middle east and india the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs customs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the continuing global terrorist threat and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require various degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline

when providing warehousing and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company the companys services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own or operate transportation assets 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” a nongaap measure “yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of the companys three primary sources of revenue 

  14  

in most cases the company acts as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions the company is the primary obligor is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier and has credit risk therefore the company is the principal in these transactions and reports revenue and the related expenses on a gross basis 

for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company does not issue a hawb or a hobl or otherwise acts solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific and europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the network 

the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each region in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs the asia pacific segment is the companys largest export oriented region and accounted for 50 of revenues and 41 of operating income for the year ended december 31 2013  asia pacifics operating income as a percentage of revenue is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that region 

strategy and culture 

the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses current management must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond its control the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

  15  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory the airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could adversely affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

international trade and competition 

the company operates in 62 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs rising costs in general political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the company’s pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers which has resulted in a compression of the companys unitary margins during 2013 we expect these competitive conditions to continue 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price 

  16  

volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

results of operations 

the following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2013  2012  and 2011  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by the company net revenue is one of the companys primary operational and financial measures that demonstrates the ability of the company to manage sell rates to customers with its ability to concentrate and leverage its purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 

the table and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in this report

2013  compared with 2012   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues and related expenses in 2013  both increased 1 as compared with 2012  a 4 increase in tonnage was offset by lower sell and buy rates that reflected continued soft market conditions primarily caused by higher available capacity relative to demand and effective carrier utilization by the company 

airfreight services net revenues in 2013  increased 4 as compared with 2012  the increase in airfreight services net revenues was principally due to a 4 increase in airfreight tonnage while net revenue per kilo remained relatively constant 

north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 3 4 and 3 respectively in 2013  as compared with 2012  while airfreight export tonnage increased 2 3 and 4 in north america asia pacific and europe respectively 

the global airfreight market continues to be affected by the decrease in size and weight of high technology consumer products and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible the company expects these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands these factors result in a higher degree of volatility in buy and sell rates and volumes 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses both decreased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily driven by lower sell rates to customers and buy rates from carriers reflecting increased carrier capacity that outpaced overall market demand the decreases in sell and buy rates were partially offset by a 6 increase in container volumes in 2013  as compared with 2012  container volume is measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily resulting from additional services and volumes with new and existing customers utilizing order management services ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the largest component of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 46 and 47 of ocean freight net revenue in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 1 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily due to a 7 decrease in net revenue per container offset by a 6 increase in container volume in 2013 ocean carriers attempted on several occasions throughout the year to increase prices ultimately these efforts were relatively unsuccessful and market ocean rates fell in the face of ongoing capacity issues in order to maintain and grow market share the company reacted to these market trends by temporarily absorbing carrier cost increases when the company anticipated such cost increases would be temporary and could not be sustained by the carriers the company also implemented rate reductions with its customers where needed to reflect market conditions mostly on exports from china 

order management net revenues increased 6 in 2013  as compared with 2012  due to additional services and volumes with new and existing customers direct ocean freight forwarding remained flat in 2013  as compared with 2012  

north america and europe ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 3 and 1 respectively while asia pacific ocean freight net revenues decreased by 2 in 2013  as compared with 2012 the decrease in net revenues in asia pacific is due to the company implementing sell rate reductions to customers primarily in the second half of 2013 which on average outpaced buy rate reductions negotiated with carriers and was partially offset by a 15 increase in container volume 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 5 and 8 respectively in 2013  as compared with 2012  as a result of increased volumes from existing and new customers and higher costs in timedefinite transcon services 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 3 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers the margin percentage declined primarily as a result of higher costs in timedefinite transcon services customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

north america and asia pacific customs brokerage and other services net revenues both increased 4 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily as a result of higher volumes these increases were partially offset by a 3 decline in europe related to the economic challenges in europe 

  18  

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 4 in 2013  as compared with 2012  primarily due to increases in base salaries higher field and executive management bonuses earned as a result of increases in operating income and accrual of a retirement bonus 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2013  were both up 4 as compared with 2012  primarily as a result of a 4 increase in operating income the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs increased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2013 as compared with 2012 primarily due to increases in base salaries and a retirement bonus 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before current management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

on october 7 2013 the company and peter j rose the companys chairman and chief executive officer entered into a succession agreement agreement mr rose will retire as chief executive officer of the company effective march 1 2014 and expects to remain chairman of the board of directors until the annual meeting of shareholders in may 2015 pursuant to the agreement mr rose will receive a retirement bonus equal to the amount he would have received under the 2008 executive incentive compensation plan plan for 2014 and the first five months of 2015 assuming that mr rose received the same percentage of the pool under the plan that was used to calculate his incentive compensation for the quarter ended june 30 2013 the company currently estimates that the total retirement bonus will approximate 8 million and recorded that amount in its entirety in the fourth quarter of 2013 as allowed by the plan the compensation committee of the company will not reallocate mr rose’s current percentage of the available pool to other officers or key employees until actual payments made to mr rose under the agreement are complete and an amount equal to the total retirement bonus paid has been recouped 

other overhead expenses decreased 4 in 2013  as compared with 2012  the 2012 results included a fine of €414 million 55 million related to the european commissions finding against the company for anticompetitive behavior a 6 million adjustment for certain foreign indirect withholding taxes and 3 million of expense associated with the writeoff of capitalized real estate projects that the company decided not to continue pursuing the impact of these 2012 items was partially offset by an 8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as a result of investments in technology and building and leasehold improvements and higher costs of claims other overhead expenses decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2013  as compared with 2012  

income tax expense 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 389  in 2013  as compared with 395  in 2012  the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to lower nondeductible expenses as compared to the prior year period and less of a negative impact in the current year period associated with the companys stockbased compensation arrangements when compared to the prior year period the tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and is recorded at the time of the disqualifying event 

2012  compared with 2011   

airfreight services 

airfreight services revenues and related expenses both decreased 10 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily due to a 6 decrease in tonnage and lower sell and buy rates that reflected soft market conditions 

airfreight services net revenues in 2012  decreased 12 as compared with 2011  the decrease in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 6 decrease in airfreight tonnage and a 7 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 7 16 and 13 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  while airfreight export tonnage decreased 12 2 and 6 in north america asia pacific and europe respectively the decline in airfreight tonnage in 2012  can be attributed to an overall decrease in the global airfreight market as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible and a lower level of customer specific infrastructure and project related tonnage than experienced in 2011  net revenue per kilo was lower in 2012  compared to 2011  as carriers reduced overall available capacity to manage market pricing and the company was unable to implement corresponding price adjustments to its customers in a timely manner 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses increased 5 and 7 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily driven by price increases implemented by carriers and the companys corresponding increases in sell rates the increases in sell and buy rates were partially offset by a decrease in container volumes of 2 in 2012  as compared with 2011  

  19  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2012  as compared with 2011  north america ocean freight net revenues increased 2 while asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues decreased by 3 and 1 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  

in 2012  and 2011  the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 47 and 50 respectively of ocean freight net revenue ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 7 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily due to a 4 decrease in net revenue per container and a 2 decrease in container volume as measured in terms of feus the decrease in net revenue per container resulted from the timing of significant increases in buy rates implemented by carriers requirements to provide notice of these increases to customers and the companys ability to implement commensurate increases in its sell rates direct ocean freight forwarding and order management net revenues which are primarily feebased increased 8 and 2 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  due to an increase in market share and volume 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses both increased 2 in 2012  as compared with 2011  as a result of increases in timedefinite transcon volumes 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 2 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily as a result of an increase in timedefinite transcon volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 02 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily due to a higher average number of employees increases in base salaries payroll taxes and medical costs which were partially offset by a decline in bonuses earned due to lower operating income 

the results in 2012 were not consistent with the historical relationship between salaries and net revenues primarily due to a decrease in net revenues while the average number of employees increased to support customer driven initiatives enhance information systems and expand certain products bonuses to field and executive management in 2012  consistent with declines in branch and company performance were down 9 and 14 respectively as compared with 2011  

other overhead expenses increased 5 in 2012  as compared with 2011  this increase was primarily due to the european commissions finding against the company for anticompetitive behavior which resulted in a fine of €414 million 55 million higher legal expenses an adjustment for certain foreign indirect withholding taxes of approximately 6 million claims related to increased liability limits and cost associated with maintaining and enhancing the companys information systems the company also decided not to continue pursuit of certain real estate development projects recorded under construction in process and expensed the associated costs of 3 million as a component of rent and occupancy expense these increases offset lower travel and entertainment expense achieved through continued cost reduction measures other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 in 2012  as compared with 2011  

income tax expense 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 395  in both 2012  and 2011  on a percentage basis relative to pretax earnings available tax deductions associated with disqualifying dispositions of both incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares were consistent between both 2012 and 2011 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2013  2012  and 2011  was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2013  and 2012  net foreign currency losses were approximately 1 million  5 million  and 2 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than the company however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 408 million  as compared with 370 million  for 2012  this 38 million  increase is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts and higher earnings partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes primarily associated with the remittance of dividends from foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2013  working capital was 1545 million  including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1274 million  the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2013  management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria the company has agreed to extend payment terms beyond its customary terms management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso and canadian dollar 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2013  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 40 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 33 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2013  was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 1 million  5 million  and 2 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2013  and 2012  the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2013  the company had approximately 39 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

  22  

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2013  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1274 million  of which 684 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2013  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2013  would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2013  and 2012

 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level

the company is developing a new accounting system which it plans to implement on a worldwide basis over the next several years this system is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes and reporting this transition will affect the processes that constitute the companys internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for operating effectiveness 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  23

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

at january 31 2013 the company including its majorityowned subsidiaries is organized functionally in geographic operating segments and operates full service offices in the regions identified below full service offices have also been established in locations where the company maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock 

the company operates full service offices in the following geographic regions 

 the company also maintains sales and satellite offices which are aligned with and dependent on one or more full service offices noted above additionally the company contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has established 43 such relationships worldwide 

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400 

the company’s internet address is httpwwwexpeditorscom  the company makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and equity attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 34  37  and 38  percent of the company’s 2012  2011  and 2010  consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

 1  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 while their operations have improved over 2009 levels many airlines remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 24  23  and 23  percent of the company’s 2012  2011  and 2010  consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” which specializes in ocean freight consolidation in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers and for those customers that prefer to have the flexibility that eios multiple carrier contracts and sailings offer eio also solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 2011 and 2012 and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volume in 2012 was comparable to 2011 many carriers took delivery of new ships which created excess capacity this excessive capacity caused most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization supplier performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes 

 2  

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 42  40  and 39  percent of the company’s 2012  2011  and 2010  consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution inventory management and time definite transportation services none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

marketing and customers 

the company provides specific solutions tailored to each customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s efforts are focused on optimizing our customers’ supply chains therefore the companys marketing efforts target professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment retail goods machine and automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers the company has also established industry vertical teams located throughout our network that focus on retail and fashion oil and energy aviation and aerospace and healthcare historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge 

 3  

for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2013 

employees 

at january 31 2013  the company employed approximately 13700  people 4700  in the united states and 840  in the balance of north america 680  in latin america 3910  in asia pacific 2340  in europe and africa and 1230  in the middle east and india approximately 1610  of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7940  in operations and 4150  in technology finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require various degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

 6  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2012  was 5 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation domestic time definite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs rising costs in general political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the company’s pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers which has resulted in a compression of the companys operating margins the company has also experienced a decrease in airfreight tonnage in 2012 compared to prior years as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible absent of any meaningful improvement in these conditions the company expects similar trends to continue in the near term 

 13  

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific and europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the network 

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory the airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

the company operates in 63 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

  14  

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses these losses must be made up from future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events and risks the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

 15  

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2012  2011  and 2010  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 



2012  compared with 2011   

net revenues 

airfreight services net revenues in 2012  decreased 12 as compared with 2011  the decrease in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 6 decrease in airfreight tonnage and a 7 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 7 16 and 13 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  while airfreight export tonnage decreased 12 2 and 6 in north america asia pacific and europe respectively the decline in airfreight tonnage in 2012  can be attributed to an overall decrease in the global airfreight market as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible and a lower level of customer specific infrastructure and project related tonnage than experienced in 2011  net revenue per kilo was lower in 2012  compared to 2011  as carriers reduced overall available capacity to manage market pricing and the company was unable to implement corresponding price adjustments to its customers in a timely manner 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2012  as compared with 2011  north america ocean freight net revenues increased 2 while asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues decreased by 3 and 1 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  

ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the largest component of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 47 and 50 of ocean freight net revenue in 2012  and 2011  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 7 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily due to a 4 decrease in net revenue per container and a 2 decrease in container volume as measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus the decrease in net revenue per container resulted from the timing of significant increases in buy rates implemented by carriers requirements to provide notice of these increases to customers and the companys ability to implement commensurate increases in its sell rates direct ocean freight forwarding and order management net revenues which are primarily feebased increased 8 and 2 respectively in 2012  as compared with 2011  due to an increase in market share and volume 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 2 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily as a result of an increase in domestic time definite transportation volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 02 in 2012  as compared with 2011  primarily due to a higher average number of employees increases in base salaries payroll taxes and medical costs which were partially offset by a decline in bonuses earned due to lower operating income 

salaries and related costs and stockbased compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue are as follows   



historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests however the results in 2012  were not consistent with this historical relationship primarily due to a decrease in net revenues while the average number of employees increased to support customer driven initiatives enhance information systems and expand certain products bonuses to field and executive management in 2012  consistent with declines in branch and company performance were down 9 and 14 respectively as compared with 2011  the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 5 in 2012  as compared with 2011  this increase is primarily due to the european commissions finding against the company for anticompetitive behavior which resulted in a fine of €414 million 55 million higher legal expenses an adjustment for certain foreign indirect withholding taxes of approximately 59 million claims related to increased liability limits and cost associated with maintaining and enhancing our information systems the company also decided not to continue pursuit of certain real estate development projects recorded under construction in process and expensed the associated costs of 3 million as a component of rent and occupancy expensethese increases offset lower travel and entertainment expense achieved through continued cost reduction measures other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 in 2012  as compared with 2011  

income tax expense 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 395  in both 2012  and 2011  on a percentage basis relative to pretax earnings available tax deductions associated with disqualifying dispositions of both incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares were consistent between both 2012 and 2011 the tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and is recorded at the time of the disqualifying event 

2011  compared with 2010   

net revenues 

airfreight services net revenues in 2011  increased 9 as compared with 2010  the increase in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 12 increase in net revenue per kilo while airfreight tonnage remained constant north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 10 8 and 12 respectively in 2011 as compared with 2010 while airfreight export tonnage increased 5 and 4 in north america and europe respectively and decreased 3 in asia pacific net revenue per kilo was higher as the company benefited from intermittent buying opportunities created from excess carrier capacity primarily in asia after the first quarter of 2011 the company experienced a decline in quarterly airfreight volumes as compared to 2010 and the customary peak season surge in the fourth quarter did not materialize 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 13 in 2011 as compared with 2010 north america asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 13 13 and 16 respectively in 2011 as compared with 2010 

in 2011 and 2010 the majority of the companys ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 51 respectively of ocean freight net revenue 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 12 in 2011 as compared with 2010 primarily due to a 10 increase in net revenue per container similar to airfreight the increase in net revenue per container resulted from excess carrier capacity in 2011 leading to the creation of positive buying opportunities primarily in asia volume as measured in terms of feus increased 2 in 2011 as compared with 2010 direct ocean freight forwarding

and order management which are primarily feebased increased 13 and 16 respectively in 2011 as compared with 2010 due to an increase in volume 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 14 in 2011 as compared with 2010 primarily as a result of growth in market share and an increase in domestic time definite transportation volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

overhead expenses 

salaries and related costs increased 11 in 2011 as compared with 2010 primarily as a result of i an increase in the number of employees ii an overall increase in average base salaries and related taxes and benefits and iii larger bonuses earned from achieving higher operating income

income tax expense 

the companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2011 was 395 as compared to 389 for 2010 the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2011 as compared with 2010 is primarily the result of higher state tax rates and a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2011 as compared with 2010 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2012  2011  and 2010  was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2012  and 2011  net foreign currency losses were 5 million  2 million  and 2 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry some of which have significantly more resources than the company however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 370 million  as compared with 457 million  for 2011  this 87 million  decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts and lower earnings at december 31 2012  working capital was 1515 million  including cash and cash equivalents of 1261 million  the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2012  management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 47 million  as compared with 80 million  for 2011  the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology leasehold improvements and equipment and office furniture for the year ended december 31 2012  the company made capital expenditures of 48 million  as compared with 78 million  for 2011  this includes capital expenditures as noted above and approximately 7 million for the development of office and warehouse facilities in beijing china total anticipated capital expenditures in 2013  are currently estimated to be 100 million this includes routine capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 363 million  as compared with 157 million  in 2011  the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s common stock on the open market in 2012  the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared with the same period in 2011  is primarily the result of this policy and additional discretionary repurchases of 57 million shares at an average per share price of 3700 during 2012  and 2011  the company paid dividends of 56  per share and 50  per share respectively 

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2012  the company had repurchased and retired 24444917  shares of common stock at an average price of  2346  per share over the period from 1994 through 2012  during 2012  1324491  shares were repurchased at an average price of  3838  per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000  shares of common stock as of december 31 2012  the company had repurchased and retired 27871019  shares of common stock at an average price of 3571  per share over the period from 2001 through 2012  during 2012  6714813  shares were repurchased at an average price of 3747  per share 

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers’ abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2012  amounts available for borrowing under international bank lines of credit totaled 15 million  at december 31 2012  the company was contingently liable for 99 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



 19  

at december 31 2012  the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 



the company enters into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2012  will be fulfilled during 2013  in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the companys foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2012  cash and cash equivalent balances of 657 million  were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 55 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united sates and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been accrued for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012  the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso and canadian dollar 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2012  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 40 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 33 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2012  the company had less than 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2012  was insignificant net foreign currency losses were 5 million  2 million  and 2 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2012  and 2011  the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2012  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1261 million  of which 803 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2012  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2012  would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2012  and 2011

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the companys management has confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure procedures and controls or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  based on the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2012  our internal control over financial reporting was effective

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 37  38  and 35  percent of the company’s 2011  2010  and 2009  consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3900 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 while their operations in 2010 and 2011 improved over 2009 levels many airlines remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23  23  and 24  percent of the company’s 2011  2010  and 2009  consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” which specializes in ocean freight consolidation in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers eio also solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 and 2011 and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volume in 2011 was comparable to 2010 many carriers took delivery of new ships in 2011 which created excess capacity this excessive capacity caused most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization supplier performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 40  39  and 41  percent of the company’s 2011  2010  and 2009  consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution inventory management and time definite transportation none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

marketing and customers 

the company provides customer specific solutions and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from order inception through to order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s marketing efforts are focused on interacting with our customers’ supply chain including logistics transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components electronic goods medical equipment sporting goods machine parts aviation parts industrial equipment and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service

capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized online reporting the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2012 

employees 

at january 31 2012  the company employed approximately 13590  people 4620  in the united states and 800  in the balance of north america 640  in latin america 4030  in asia pacific 2280  in europe and africa and 1220  in the middle east and india approximately 1720  of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7960  in operations and 3910  in technology finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 17 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct  the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

 8  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability 

the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2011  was approximately 5 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest or security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future primarily as a result of the global economic downturn in 2009 the company’s air and ocean freight volumes were at exceptionally low levels in 2009 as compared with 2010 and 2011 consistent with slowing global economic conditions and concerns over higher fuel costs rising costs in general political unrest and volatile currency exchange rates the company’s pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers and service providers further the lower underlying flow of goods both in the global economy and throughout the companys network continued into january 2012 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

 15  

the company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific and europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however the airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years as a result of the global economic downturn and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

the company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses these losses must be made up from future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as 

 16  

accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events and risks the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

as described in note 1i to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the option vesting periods 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 2011no 05 “presentation of 

 17  

comprehensive income” which amends accounting standards codification asc topic 220 ”comprehensive income” this update is intended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by giving the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of asu 2011no 05 as amended by asu 2011no 12 beginning in the first quarter of 2012 the adoption is only expected to have a presentation impact on the companys consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of equity and comprehensive income 

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2011  2010  and 2009  expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 



2011  compared with 2010   

airfreight services net revenues in 2011  increased 9 as compared with 2010  the increase in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 12 increase in net revenue per kilo while airfreight tonnage remained constant north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 10 8 and 12 respectively in 2011  as compared with 2010  while airfreight export tonnage increased 5 and 4 in north america and europe respectively and decreased 3 in asia pacific net revenue per kilo was higher as the company benefited from intermittent buying opportunities created from excess carrier capacity primarily in asia after the first quarter of 2011 the company experienced a decline in quarterly airfreight volumes as compared to 2010 and the customary peak season surge in the fourth quarter did not materialize 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 13 in 2011  as compared with 2010  north america asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 13 13 and 16 respectively in 2011  as compared with 2010  

ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 51 of ocean freight net revenue in 2011  and 2010  respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 12 in 2011  as compared with 2010  primarily due to a 10 increase in net revenue per container similar to airfreight the increase in net revenue per container resulted from excess carrier capacity in 2011 leading to the creation of positive buying opportunities primarily in asia volume as measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus increased 2 in 2011  as compared with 2010  direct ocean freight forwarding and order management which are primarily feebased increased 13 and 16 respectively in 2011  as compared with 2010  due to an increase in volume 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 14 in 2011  as compared with 2010  primarily as a result of growth in market share and an increase in domestic time definite freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

salaries and related costs increased 11 in 2011  as compared with 2010  primarily as a result of i an increase in the number of employees ii an overall increase in average base salaries and related taxes and benefits and iii larger bonuses earned from achieving higher operating income 

 18  

the effects of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2011  and 2010  are as follows   



historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and corporate management in 2011  were up 13 as compared with 2010  primarily as a result of a 13 increase in operating income the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 13 in 2011  as compared with 2010  primarily as a result of increased facilities costs higher business taxes systems maintenance and consulting expenses travel and other expenses related to increased activity legal and related expenses increased slightly in 2011  as compared with 2010  primarily attributable to responding to matters disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company will continue to incur legal costs related to the anticompetition allegations as described in note 8 herein until these legal proceedings are concluded if the governmental regulatory agencies conclude that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior   fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year further the company periodically conducts reviews of the operations and procedures of its offices worldwide relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant for 2011  as compared with 2010  

other income net increased 17 in 2011  as compared with 2010  interest income increased 3 million due to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances during 2011  as compared with 2010  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other nonincome based taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2011  was 395  as compared to 389  for 2010  the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2011  as compared with 2010  is primarily the result of higher state tax rates and a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2011  as compared with 2010  although a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated 

2010  compared with 2009   

airfreight services net revenues in 2010 increased 31 as compared with 2009 the increase in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 35 increase in airfreight tonnage which was partially offset by a slight decrease in net revenue per kilo north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 34 39 and 15 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 while airfreight export tonnage increased 47 32 and 28 respectively the increase in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to improvements in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2009 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 19 in 2010 as compared with 2009 north america asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 17 23 and 13 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 

the majority of the companys ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 51 and 52 of ocean freight net revenue in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 16 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily due to a 20 increase in volume as measured in terms of feus partially offset by a 3 decrease in net revenue per container direct ocean freight forwarding and order management which are primarily feebased increased 15 and 34 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 due to an increase in volume 

the increase in ocean volumes is primarily due to an improvement in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2009 net revenue per container in 2010 was lower than in 2009 due to favorable spot market buying opportunities in the first half of 2009 that were not available in 2010 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 17 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of increases in international air and ocean and domestic time definite freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

 19  

salaries and related costs increased 15 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of larger bonuses earned from achieving higher operating income before bonuses an increase in the number of employees and higher stock compensation expense 

the effects of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2010 and 2009 are as follows 

excluding stock compensation expense salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased 292 basis points for 2010 as compared with 2009 this decrease can be attributed to productivity gains that resulted from more efficient staff utilization stock compensation expense increased 12 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily a result of a 4 million “true up” credit recognized in 2009 for the difference between the higher actual prevesting forfeiture experience and the prevesting forfeiture assumptions used to calculate stock option expense the net impact on salaries and related costs was 3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses 

bonuses to field and corporate management in 2010 were up 35 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of a 42 increase in operating income the companys management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

other overhead expenses increased 12 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of higher business taxes travel and other expenses related to increased activity legal and related expenses increased slightly in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily attributable to preparing the companys responses to a statement of objections issued by the european commission as described further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this report other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly for 2010 as compared with 2009 

other income net decreased 6 in 2010 as compared with 2009 interest income decreased 3 million due to lower average interest rates during 2010 as compared with 2009 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other nonincome based taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2010 was 389 as compared to 403 for 2009 the lower consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared with 2009 is primarily the result of a higher tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2010 as compared with 2009 although a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2011  2010  and 2009  was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2011  and 2010  net foreign currency gains in 2011  2010  and 2009  were 2 million  2 million  and 1 million  respectively 

international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

geographic coverage

historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011  was 457 million  as compared with 396 million  for 2010  this 61 million  increase is primarily due to an increase in net earnings and changes in working capital accounts at december 31 2011  working capital was 1491 million  including cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1295 million  the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2011  management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  was 80 million  as compared with 42 million  for 2010  the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology leasehold improvements equipment and office furniture for the year ended december 31 2011  the company made capital expenditures of 78 million  as compared with 42 million  for 2010  this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above and 36 million for real estate development primarily for office and warehouse facilities in london united kingdom and in beijing china total anticipated capital expenditures in 2012  are currently estimated to be 100 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  was 157 million  as compared with 209 million  in 2010  the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s common stock on the open market in 2011  the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared with the same period in 2010  is primarily due to fewer stock option exercises during 2011  and 2010  the company paid dividends of 50  per share and 40  per share respectively 

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot forecast the impact that ongoing uncertainties in the global economy will have on its operating results management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems the company cannot predict what fallout economic uncertainties may have on freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand supplier stability and capacity or on customers’ abilities to pay 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2011  the international bank lines of credit totaled 15 million  at december 31 2011  the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 104 million  from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 



 21  

at december 31 2011  the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 



the company enters into shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2011  will be fulfilled during 2012  in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2011  the company had repurchased and retired 23120426  shares of common stock at an average price of  2261  per share over the period from 1994 through 2011  during 2011  1250374  shares were repurchased at an average price of  4654  per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000  shares of common stock as of december 31 2011  the company had repurchased and retired 21156206  shares of common stock at an average price of 3515  per share over the period from 2001 through 2011  during 2011  1089201  shares were repurchased at an average price of 4947  per share these discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises and the exercise of employee stock purchase rights 

the companys foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2011  cash and cash equivalent balances of 579 million  were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 74 million  was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united sates and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been accrued for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011  the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso and canadian dollar 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2011  would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 46 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 38 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2011  the company had approximately 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2011  was insignificant net foreign currency gains in 2011  2010  and 2009  were 2 million  2 million  and 1 million  respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2011  and 2010  the company instead follows a policy of accelerating 

 22  

international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2011  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1295 million  of which 849 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2011  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2011  would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2011  and 2010

 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the companys management has confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure procedures and controls or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2011  our internal control over financial reporting was effective

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 38 35 and 36 percent of the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3900 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may affect its business

the commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 while their operations improved in 2010 many airlines are highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23 24 and 25 percent of the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation in most major trade lanes in the world as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers eio also solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 operations improved in 2010 but many carriers are highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to manage available capacity and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the combination of lower capacity slower sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation and performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual ex factory dates container utilization supplier performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 39 41 and 39 percent of the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and 

  

 5 

product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

marketing and customers 

the company provides customer specific solutions and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from order inception through to order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s marketing efforts are focused on interacting with our customers’ supply chain including logistics transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retention 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components electronic goods medical equipment sporting goods machine parts aviation parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

  

6  

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized online reporting the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

employees 

at january 31 2011 the company employed approximately 12880 people 4410 in the united states and 730 in the balance of north america 620 in latin america 3850 in asia pacific 2100 in europe and africa and 1170 in the middle east approximately 1730 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7550 in operations and 3600 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by different governments such as authorized economic operator “aeo” 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation 

  

10  

of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 17 special drawing rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2010 was approximately 4 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates regulatory environments cargo and other security concerns laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to regulations current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence or security concerns in the nations in which it does business such as the current events in the middle east and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with current economic conditions the company’s pricing continues to be pressured by customers and service providers 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific and europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves buy rates continued to be challenging in 2010 as volumes increased and carriers managed overall capacity consequently price changes are absorbed by the company during the shortterm pending negotiation with and acceptance by the company’s customers the combination of carriers managing capacity and associated price volatility continues to challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years as a result of the global economic downturn and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

primarily as a result of the global economic downturn the company’s air and ocean freight volumes were at exceptionally low levels in 2009 as compared to 2010 and 2008 the company’s air and ocean volumes began to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009 and this trend continued throughout 2010 due to the uncertainty in the global economy the company cannot predict whether this trend will continue 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2010 the company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 

    

 23 

    the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses these losses must be made up from future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations 

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 

      these estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could 

  

24  

be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense would not produce materially different results than those reported 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate on the amount of loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and operating cash flows 

as described in note 1i to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the option vesting periods 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and the future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options refer to note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the assumptions used by the company for estimating the fair value of options granted were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants 

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense keeping all other variables constant the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option and the resulting stock compensation expense as follows 

 



the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense 

  

 25 

recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 2009–no 13 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements ”  which amends fasb accounting standards codification topic 605 –“revenue recognition” this provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable asu 2009–no 13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of this update beginning in the first quarter of 2011 the company has assessed the impact of the adoption of asu 2009–no 13 and it is not expecting this update will have a material effect on the company’s results of operations 

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2010 2009 and 2008 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company

2010 compared with 2009 

airfreight services net revenues in 2010 increased 31 as compared with 2009 the increase in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 35 increase in airfreight tonnage which was partially offset by a slight decrease in net revenue per kilo north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 34 39 and 15 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 while airfreight export tonnage increased 47 32 and 28 respectively the increase in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to improvements in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2009 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 19 in 2010 as compared with 2009 north america asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 17 23 and 13 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 

ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 51 and 52 of ocean freight net revenue in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 16 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily due to a 20 increase in volume as measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus partially offset by a 3 decrease in net revenue per container direct ocean freight forwarding and order management which are primarily feebased increased 15 and 34 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 due to an increase in volume 

the increase in ocean volumes is primarily due to an improvement in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2009 net revenue per container in 2010 was lower than in 2009 due to favorable spot market buying opportunities in the first half of 2009 that were not available in 2010 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 17 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of increases in international air and ocean and domestic time definite freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

salaries and related costs excluding stock compensation expense increased 16 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of larger bonuses earned from achieving higher operating income before bonuses an increase in the number of employees and higher stock compensation expense 

the effects of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2010 and 2009 are as follows 

 



excluding stock compensation expense salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased 292 basis points for 2010 as compared with 2009 this decrease can be attributed to productivity gains that resulted from more efficient staff utilization stock compensation expense increased 12 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily a result of a 4 million “true up” credit recognized in 2009 for the difference between the higher actual prevesting forfeiture experience and the prevesting forfeiture assumptions used to calculate stock option expense the net impact on salaries and related costs was 3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses 

  

 27 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and corporate management in 2010 were up 35 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of a 42 increase in operating income the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 12 in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of higher business taxes travel and other expenses related to increased activity legal and related expenses increased slightly in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily attributable to preparing the company’s responses to a statement of objections issued by the european commission as described further in part i — item 3 in this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” the company will continue to incur legal costs which could be substantial and include judgments fines andor penalties until the legal proceedings described in item 3 herein are concluded further the company periodically conducts reviews of the operations and procedures of its offices worldwide relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations if the governmental regulatory agencies conclude that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior or in the event of an adverse judgment in the class action lawsuit described in item 3 herein such judgments fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and operating cash flows other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly for 2010 as compared with 2009 

other income net decreased 6 in 2010 as compared with 2009 interest income decreased 3 million due to lower average interest rates during 2010 as compared with 2009 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2010 was 389 as compared to 403 for 2009 although a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated the lower consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared 2009 is primarily the result of a higher tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2010 as compared with 2009 

2009 compared with 2008 

airfreight services net revenues in 2009 decreased 15 compared with 2008 the decrease in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 13 decline in airfreight tonnage north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 13 15 and 21 respectively in 2009 as compared with 2008 while airfreight export tonnage decreased 16 13 and 10 respectively 

  

28  

the decrease in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to the global economic downturn which began in the second half of 2008 during the first six months of 2009 net revenue per kilo increased as compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of shortterm spot markets this increase was offset during the second half of 2009 as air carriers removed significant capacity from the markets while rapidly and aggressively increasing airfreight pricing particularly in asia the company absorbed these price increases during the shortterm prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the company’s customers north america and asia pacific net revenues declined primarily due to lower export tonnage in 2009 as compared to 2008 europe net revenues declined principally due to lower export tonnage and lower import volumes primarily from asia 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 18 in 2009 as compared with 2008 north america asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues decreased approximately 19 18 and 21 respectively in 2009 as compared with 2008 

ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 52 and 59 of ocean freight net revenue in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 27 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily due to a 17 decrease in volume and a 13 decrease in net revenue per container direct ocean freight forwarding which is primarily feebased decreased 8 in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to a decrease in volume order management remained relatively constant in 2009 as compared with 2008 

the decrease in ocean volumes is primarily due to the global economic downturn net revenue per container increased in the first half of 2009 as compared with 2008 as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of shortterm spot markets steamship lines removed significant capacity from the market and implemented price increases in the second half of 2009 particularly on the pacific north america lanes the combination of these moves eliminated the favorable buying opportunities that existed in the first half of 2009 these price increases were absorbed by the company during the second half of 2009 prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the company’s customers 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues decreased 10 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of declines in air and ocean freight volumes 

salaries and related costs decreased 10 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of i smaller bonuses due to lower operating income ii an overall decrease in base salaries directly related to a lower headcount and iii lower stock compensation expense 

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2009 and 2008 are as follows 

 



excluding stock compensation expense salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue increased 208 basis points for 2009 as compared with 2008 this increase is largely due to the fixed nature of base salaries and management’s commitment to maintaining its people during this economic downturn stock compensation expense declined 13 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily a result of a 4 million “true up” credit recognized in the first quarter of 2009 for the difference between the higher actual prevesting forfeiture experience and the prevesting forfeiture assumptions used to calculate stock option expense the net impact on 

  

 29 

salaries and related costs was 3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses this credit relates primarily to stock option grants made in 2006 the majority of which began vesting in may 2009 

the company’s operating income in 2009 was 19 lower than the amount reported in 2008 this was the first year since 1984 that the company’s operating income was lower than the amount which had been reported in the previous year bonuses to field and corporate management in 2009 were also both down 19 as compared with 2008 the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

other overhead expenses decreased 16 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of continued cost reduction measures including cutbacks on travel and entertainment expenses legal and related expenses decreased approximately 11 million in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily attributable to lower activity related to governmental regulatory agencies’ ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in part i—item 3 in this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant for 2009 as compared with 2008 

other income net decreased 32 in 2009 as compared with 2008 interest income decreased 11 million due to lower average interest rates during 2009 as compared with 2008 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2009 was 403 as compared to 394 for 2008 the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 as compared 2008 is primarily the result of a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2009 as compared with 2008 

currency and other risk factors 

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

developing these systems and a worldwide network adds a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2010

2009 and 2008 was insignificant net foreign currency gains in 2010 and 2009 were 2 million and 1 million respectively net foreign currency losses in 2008 were 191000 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 

geographic coverage 

during 2010 the company opened three fullservice offices 1 curitiba brazil 2 oslo norway and 3 zhongshan people’s republic of china formerly a satellite of shenzhen people’s republic of china the company opened two satellite offices 1 belo horizonte brazil and 2 rome italy the company changed the macau people’s republic of china office from a full service to a satellite office and closed one satellite office in lewiston new york 

acquisitions – historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

internal growth – management believes that a comparison of “same store” results is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth the “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year there were no significant differences between the “same store” analysis and the company’s results for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 396 million as compared with 331 million for 2009 this 65 million increase is primarily due to an increase in net earnings offset by changes in working capital accounts primarily an increase in accounts receivable at december 31 2010 working capital was 1278 million including cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1085 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2010 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 42 million as compared with 41 million for 2009 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology leasehold improvements equipment and office furniture for the year ended december 31 2010 the company made capital expenditures of 42 million as compared with 40 million for 2009 which includes prepayments on longterm land leases this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above and 13 million for real estate development total capital expenditures in 2011 are currently estimated to be 117 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional

real estate development in 2010 the company entered into contracts to develop officewarehouse facilities in london united kingdom and in beijing china and these projects are expected to be completed in 2011 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 209 million as compared with 117 million in 2009 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s common stock on the open market in 2010 the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared with the same period in 2009 is primarily due to a greater number of shares repurchased and a higher average price per share during 2010 and 2009 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 40 per share and 38 per share respectively 

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets however there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot forecast the impact that ongoing uncertainties in the global economy will have on its operating results management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems the company cannot predict what fallout economic uncertainties may have on freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand supplier stability and capacity or on customers’ abilities to pay 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2010 the international bank lines of credit totaled 22 million at december 31 2010 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 91 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 

 



at december 31 2010 the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 

 



the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only 

  

32  

enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2010 will be fulfilled during 2011 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2010 the company had repurchased and retired 21870052 shares of common stock at an average price of 2124 per share over the period from 1994 through 2010 during 2010 2235613 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4441 per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2010 the company had repurchased and retired 20067005 shares of common stock at an average price of 3437 per share over the period from 2001 through 2010 during 2010 3218407 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4569 per share these discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises and the exercise of employee stock purchase rights 

management believes that the company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalent balances of 561 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 66 million was held in banks in the united states 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2010 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may hold currencies that are not the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the company’s earnings 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2010 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 40 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 32 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2010 the company had approximately 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2010 was insignificant net foreign currency gains in 2010 and 2009 were 2 million and 1 million respectively net foreign currency losses in 2008 were 191000 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2010 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1085 million of which 641 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2010 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2010 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2009 and 2010

 item 9a — controls and procedures 

evaluation of controls and procedures 

the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

we have confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure procedures and controls or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a system of internal control can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting was effective

 item 1—business 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services the company offers its customers a seamless international network supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods the company’s services include the consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight in each united states office and in many overseas offices the company acts as a customs broker the company also provides additional services including distribution management vendor consolidation cargo insurance purchase order management and customized logistics information the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships 

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

the company including its majorityowned subsidiaries operates full service offices • in the cities identified below full service offices have also been established in locations where the company maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock  in other cities the company contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has established approximately 47 such relationships worldwide locations where company employees perform sales and customer service functions are identified below as international service centers  whollyowned locations operating under the supervision and control of another full service office are identified as satellite offices  in each case the opening date for the full service office international service center or satellite office is set forth in parenthesis 

 

   

  

   

  

  

   

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400 

the company’s internet address is httpwwwexpeditorscom  the company makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 35 percent in 2009 and 36 percent for each of the company’s 2008 and 2007 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the commercial airline industry as a whole continues to incur substantial operating losses and many airlines are highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 24 25 and 24 percent of the company’s 2009 2008 and 2007 consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

ocean carriers continue to incur substantial operating losses and many are highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to reduce available capacity and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the combination of fewer ships slower sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

order management provides origin consolidation vendor management container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based and server based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual ex factory dates container utilization vendor performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many vendors in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 41 39 and 40 percent of the company’s 2009 2008 and 2007 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

  

marketing and customers 

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s marketing efforts are focused on interacting with our customers’ supply chain including logistics transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components electronic goods medical equipment sporting goods machine parts aviation parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas 

the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized online reporting the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration “tsa” of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o perating c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees the company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 17 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2009 was approximately 4 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers

 item 3 — legal proceedings 

on october 10 2007 the u s department of justice doj issued a subpoena ordering the company to produce certain information and records relating to an investigation of alleged anticompetitive behavior amongst air cargo freight forwarders the company has retained the services of a law firm to assist in complying with the doj’s subpoena as part of this process the company has met with and continues to cooperate with the doj the company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing investigation which could include fines andor penalties if the doj concludes that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior and such fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and operating cash flows 

on january 3 2008 the company was named as a defendant with seven other european and north americanbased global logistics providers in a federal antitrust class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court of the eastern district of new york precision associates inc et al v panalpina world transport no 08cv0042 on july 21 2009 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding a number of new third party defendants and various claims which they assert to violate the sherman act the plaintiffs’ amended complaint which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of customers and has not yet been certified asserts claims that the defendants engaged in price fixing regarding eight discrete surcharges in violation of the sherman act the allegations concerning the company relate to two of these surcharges the amended complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief the company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself on august 13 2009 the company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim which is currently pending before the court plaintiffs filed their opposition to the company’s motion on january 30 2010 and the motion is currently pending before the court 

on june 18 2008 the european commission ec issued a request for information to the company’s uk subsidiary expeditors international uk ltd requesting certain information relating to an ongoing investigation of freight forwarders the company replied to the request on february 18 2009 the ec issued another request for information to the same subsidiary requesting certain additional information in connection with the ec’s ongoing investigation of freight forwarders the company replied to the request on february 10 2010 the company and its hong kong subsidiary expeditors hong kong limited received a statement of objections so from the ec the so initiates a proceeding against the company alleging possible anticompetitive behavior contrary to european union rules on competition specific to the company the allegations in the so are limited to the period from august 2005 to june 2006 and only concern airfreight trade lanes between south chinahong kong and the european economic area the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations the company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing proceeding which could include administrative fines if the ec concludes that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and operating cash flows

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence or security concerns in the nations in which it does business the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with current economic conditions the company’s pricing continues to be pressured by customers and service providers 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility americas asia europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair and australasia each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves buy rates were highly volatile in 2009 due to lower overall volumes and actions taken by carriers to reduce capacity in order to curtail operating losses consequently price changes are absorbed by the company during the shortterm pending negotiation with and acceptance by the company’s customers the combination of reduced capacity price volatility and fewer shipping options offered by carriers could challenge the company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years as a result of the global economic downturn and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

primarily as a result of the global economic downturn the company’s air and ocean freight volumes were lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2007 this decline in volumes started in the second half of 2008 at this point in time the company cannot predict the ongoing impact of the current global economic conditions or whether various governmental stimulus plans will be effective in reducing uncertainty in the global economy both the total revenues and net revenues for 2009 were lower as compared with 2008 and 2007 these results are unprecedented in the company’s history 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2009 the company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demands 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses these losses must be made up from future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations 

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense would not produce materially different results than those reported 

as described in note 1i to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the option vesting periods 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and the future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options refer to note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the assumptions used by the company for estimating the fair value of options granted were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants 

  

management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense keeping all other variables constant the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option and the resulting stock compensation expense as follows 

 

 

 the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 2009–no 13 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements ”  which amends fasb accounting standards codification topic 605 –“revenue recognition” this provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable asu 2009–no 13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of this update beginning in the first quarter of 2011 the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of asu 2009–no 13 

  

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2009 2008 and 2007 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

 

 2009 compared with 2008 

airfreight services net revenues in 2009 decreased 15 compared with 2008 the decrease in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 13 decline in airfreight tonnage north america asia and europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 13 15 and 21 respectively in 2009 as compared with 2008 while airfreight export tonnage decreased 16 13 and 10 respectively 

the decrease in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to the global economic downturn which began in the second half of 2008 during the first six months of 2009 net revenue per kilo increased as compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of shortterm spot markets this increase was offset during the second half of 2009 as air carriers removed significant capacity from the markets while rapidly and aggressively increasing airfreight pricing particularly in asia the company absorbed these price increases during the shortterm prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the company’s customers north america and asia net revenues declined primarily due to lower export tonnage in 2009 as compared to 2008 europe net revenues declined principally due to lower export tonnage and lower import volumes primarily from asia 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 18 in 2009 as compared with 2008 north america asia and europe ocean freight net revenues decreased approximately 19 18 and 21 respectively in 2009 as compared with 2008 

ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 52 and 59 of ocean freight net revenue in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 27 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily due to a 17 decrease in volume and a 13 decrease in net revenue per container direct ocean freight forwarding which is primarily feebased decreased 8 in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to a decrease in volume order management remained relatively constant in 2009 as compared with 2008 

  

the decrease in ocean volumes is primarily due to the global economic downturn net revenue per container increased in the first half of 2009 as compared with 2008 as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of shortterm spot markets steamship lines removed significant capacity from the market and implemented price increases in the second half of 2009 particularly on the pacific north america lanes the combination of these moves eliminated the favorable buying opportunities that existed in the first half of 2009 these price increases were absorbed by the company during the second half of 2009 prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the company’s customers 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues decreased 10 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of declines in air and ocean freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment 

salaries and related costs decreased 10 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of i smaller bonuses due to lower operating income ii an overall decrease in base salaries directly related to a lower headcount and iii lower stock compensation expense 

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2009 and 2008 are as follows 

 

 excluding stock compensation expense salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue increased 208 basis points for 2009 as compared with 2008 this increase is largely due to the fixed nature of base salaries and management’s commitment to maintaining its people during this economic downturn stock compensation expense declined 13 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily a result of a 4 million “true up” credit recognized in the first quarter of 2009 for the difference between the higher actual prevesting forfeiture experience and the prevesting forfeiture assumptions used to calculate stock option expense the net impact on salaries and related costs was 3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses this credit relates primarily to stock option grants made in 2006 the majority of which began vesting in may 2009 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests the effectiveness of this alignment is demonstrated by comparing the yearoveryear impact on 2009 management bonuses the company’s operating income in 2009 was 19 lower than the amount reported in 2008 this was the first year since 1984 that the company’s operating income was lower than the amount which had been reported in the previous year bonuses paid to field and corporate management in 2009 were also both down 19 as compared with 2008 the company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance 

because the company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the company’s services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses decreased 16 in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily as a result of continued cost reduction measures including cutbacks on travel and entertainment expenses legal and related expenses decreased approximately 11 million in 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily attributable to lower activity related to governmental regulatory agencies’ ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in part i—item 3 on this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” the company believes that legal and related expenses will increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of receiving a statement of objections from the european commission on february 10 2010 the company will continue to incur legal costs which could be substantial and include judgments fines andor penalties until these proceedings are concluded further the company periodically conducts reviews of the operations and procedures of its offices 

  

worldwide relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations if the governmental regulatory agencies conclude that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior or in the event of an adverse judgment in the class action lawsuit such judgments fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and operating cash flows other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant for 2009 as compared with 2008 

other income net decreased 32 in 2009 as compared with 2008 interest income decreased 11 million due to lower average interest rates during 2009 as compared with 2008 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2009 was 403 as compared to 394 for 2008 although a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 as compared 2008 is primarily the result of a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2009 as compared with 2008 

2008 compared with 2007 

airfreight services net revenues in 2008 increased 10 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue per kilo of 12 which was offset by a 4 decline in global airfreight tonnage airfreight services net revenues from north america and europe increased 14 and 13 respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily a result of tonnage increases of 6 and 3 respectively combined with net revenue per kilo increases of 11 and 6 respectively airfreight services net revenues from asia increased 1 for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily a result of a 14 increase in net revenue per kilo offset by an 11 decrease in tonnage these changes were primarily the result of a more favorable business mix reduction in less profitable business development of more profitable long haul routes and enhanced opportunities to create more efficient and cost effective consolidations 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 14 during 2008 as compared to 2007 ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 59 of ocean freight net revenue in 2008 and 60 in 2007 ocean freight consolidation net revenue grew at a rate of 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 while the other services ocean forwarding and order management which are primarily fee based grew at rates of 16 and 21 respectively ocean freight consolidation volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus in 2008 were approximately equal to 2007 while net revenue per container on an aggregate basis increased 11 for the same period the increase in ocean freight net revenues was a combination of the company’s response to changing market dynamics with aggressive sales efforts and the underlying impact of carrier capacity cutbacks on the market in general 

the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 9 in 2008 compared to 2007 over 50 of the increase in ocean freight net revenues was a result of growth in the order management and ocean forwarding business ocean freight net revenues for asia and europe increased 17 and 24 respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases were a result of continued marketing efforts and opportunities provided by customer service initiatives 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 9 in 2008 as compared with 2007 consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

salaries and related costs increased 9 in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels 

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2008 and 2007 are as follows 

 

 of the 62 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 as compared with 2007 30 basis points are the result of the decrease in stock compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue the remaining 32 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 as compared with 2007 can be attributed to 

  

productivity increases which resulted from more efficient staffing utilization historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 12 in 2008 as compared with 2007 as rent expense communications expense process improvement and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 in 2008 as compared with 2007 the company incurred legal and related expenses of 10 million in 2008 as compared to 4 million in 2007 primarily attributable to the doj ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in part i—item 3 on this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” the company will continue to incur substantial legal costs which could include fines andor penalties until these proceedings are concluded if the doj andor ec concludes that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior such fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and operating cash flows despite the legal and related expenditures mentioned above other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant for 2008 as compared to 2007 this was primarily due to the continued achievement of cost containment objectives 

other income net remained relatively constant in 2008 when compared with 2007 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2008 was 394 as compared to 400 for 2007 

currency and other risk factors 

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group historically the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

developing these systems and a worldwide network adds a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2009 2008 and 2007 was insignificant net foreign currency gains incurred in 2009 were 1 million net foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were 191000 net foreign currency gains incurred in 2007 were 1 million the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 

  

geographic coverage 

during 2009 the company opened three fullservice offices 1 new orleans louisiana formerly a satellite of houston texas 2 muscat sultanate of oman formerly an agent location and 3 wuhan people’s republic of china formerly a satellite of chongqing people’s republic of china the company opened one satellite office in tulsa oklahoma satellite of dallas texas 

the company closed two fullservice offices 1 port louis mauritius and 2 caracas venezuela and three satellite offices 1 graz austria 2 port elizabeth south africa and 3 maiquetía venezuela 

acquisitions  historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

internal growth  management believes that a comparison of “same store” results is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 331 million as compared with 409 million for 2008 this 78 million decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net earnings offset by changes in working capital accounts at december 31 2009 working capital was 1079 million including cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 927 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2009 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties in the united states to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 41 million as compared with 59 million during the same period of 2008 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2009 the company made capital expenditures of 40 million including prepayment on a longterm land lease as compared with 60 million for the same period in 2008 total capital expenditures in 2010 are currently estimated to be 90 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate development 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 117 million as compared with 161 million in 2008 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s common stock on the open market in 2009 the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared with the same period in 2008 is primarily due to fewer shares repurchased during 2009 and 2008 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 38 per share and 32 per share respectively 

  

the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the recent disruption in the credit markets however if there is continued and expanded disruption in the credit markets there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot forecast the impact that ongoing uncertainties in the global economy will have on its operating results management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems the company cannot predict what fallout these economic uncertainties may have on freight volumes changes in consumer demand supplier stability and capacity or on customers’ abilities to pay 

the company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2009 the international bank lines of credit totaled 26 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 11 million which is available for issuances of standby letters of credit at december 31 2009 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 78 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform 

 

 at december 31 2009 the company’s contractual obligations are as follows 

 

 the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2009 will be fulfilled during 2010 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2009 the company had repurchased and retired 19634439 shares of common stock at an average price of 1860 per share over the period from 1994 through 2009 during 2009 1472689 shares were repurchased at an average price of 3147 per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2009 the company had repurchased and retired 16848598 shares of common stock at an average price of 3221 per share over the period from 2001 through 2009 during 2009 1258596 shares were repurchased at an average price of 3033 per share these discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises 

  

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2009 cash and cash equivalent balances of 486 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 62 million was held in banks in the united states 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2009 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2009 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 31 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 25 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2009 the company had less than 2 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2009 was insignificant net foreign currency gains incurred in 2009 were 1 million net foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were 191000 net foreign currency gains incurred in 2007 were 1 million the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2009 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 927 million of which 539 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2009 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2009 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2008 and 2009

evaluation of controls and procedures

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

we have confidence in the company’s internal controls and procedures nevertheless the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure procedures and controls or the company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all the company’s control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 36 percent for each of the company’s 2008 2007 and 2006 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 25 24 and 25 percent of the company’s 2008 2007 and 2006 consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

order management previously referred to as ecms or expeditors cargo management system provides origin consolidation vendor management container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based and server based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual ex factory dates container utilization vendor performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from 

  

many vendors in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 39 40 and 39 percent of the company’s 2008 2007 and 2006 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

marketing and customers 

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly computerized customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

seasonality 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

employees 

at january 31 2009 the company employed approximately 12580 people 4390 in the united states and 750 in the balance of north america 630 in latin america 3520 in asia 2020 in europe and africa 1040 in the middle east and 230 in australasia approximately 1790 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7300 in operations and 3490 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o wned c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by different governments 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees while many of these regulations have not been finalized at this time it is the company’s position that much of the increased costs of compliance with security regulations will need to be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 17 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity wholly owned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2008 was approximately 4 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility americas asia europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair and australasia each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

primarily as a result of the global economic downturn the company’s air and ocean freight volumes were lower in the second half of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 also airfreight volumes in the second half of 2008 were lower than volumes in the first half of 2008 these results are unprecedented in the company’s history at this point in time the company cannot predict the ongoing impact of the current global economic downturn or whether various governmental stimulus plans will be effective 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2008 the company operates in 61 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations 

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense would not produce materially different results than those reported 

as described in note 1i to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 123r revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r this accounting standard requires the recognition of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and employee stock purchase plans this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the option vesting periods 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option cancellations and the future interest rates and dividend yields 

the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options refer to note 4f in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the assumptions used by the company for estimating the fair value of options granted under sfas 123r were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants 

management believes that these assumptions are appropriate based upon the requirements of sfas 123r the guidance included in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 and the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

  

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense keeping all other variables constant the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option and the resulting stock compensation expense as follows 

 

 the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51” sfas 160 sfas 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity sfas 160 modifies the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 160 beginning in the first quarter of 2009 the company had minority interest of 17498 as of december 31 2008 and 17208 as of december 31 2007 that it expects will be reclassified to equity under the provisions of sfas 160 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas 141r sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 141r beginning in the first quarter of 2009 the impact will depend upon the acquisitions if any the company consummates after the effective date 

  

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2008 2007 and 2006 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

 

 2008 compared with 2007 

airfreight services net revenues in 2008 increased 10 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue per kilo of 12 which was offset by a 4 decline in global airfreight tonnage airfreight services net revenues from north america and europe increased 14 and 13 respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily a result of tonnage increases of 6 and 3 respectively combined with net revenue per kilo increases of 11 and 6 respectively airfreight services net revenues from asia increased 1 for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily a result of a 14 increase in net revenue per kilo offset by an 11 decrease in tonnage these changes are primarily the result of a more favorable business mix reduction in less profitable business development of more profitable long haul routes and enhanced opportunities to create more efficient and cost effective consolidations 

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 14 during 2008 as compared to 2007 ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the majority of the company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 59 of ocean freight net revenue in 2008 and 60 in 2007 ocean freight consolidation net revenue grew at a rate of 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 while the other services ocean forwarding and order management which are primarily fee based grew at rates of 16 and 21 respectively ocean freight consolidation volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus in 2008 were approximately equal to 2007 while net revenue per container on an aggregate basis increased 11 for the same period the increase in ocean freight net revenues is a combination of the company’s response to changing market dynamics with aggressive sales efforts and the underlying impact of carrier capacity cutbacks on the market in general 

the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 9 in 2008 compared to 2007 over 50 of the increase in ocean freight net revenues was a result of growth in the order management and ocean forwarding business ocean freight net revenues for asia and europe increased 17 and 24 respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases were a result of continued marketing efforts and opportunities provided by customer service initiatives 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 9 in 2008 as compared with 2007 consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

  

salaries and related costs increased 9 in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels 

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2008 and 2007 are as follows 

 

 of the 62 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 as compared with 2007 30 basis points are the result of the decrease in stock compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue 

the remaining 32 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 as compared with 2007 can be attributed to productivity increases which resulted from more efficient staffing utilization historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 12 in 2008 as compared with 2007 as rent expense communications expense process improvement and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 in 2008 as compared with 2007 the company incurred legal and related expenses of 10 million in 2008 as compared to 4 million in 2007 primarily attributable to the department of justice’s “doj” ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in part i—item 3 on this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” the company will continue to incur substantial legal costs which could include fines andor penalties until these proceedings are concluded if the doj andor ec concludes that the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior such fines andor penalties could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and operating cash flows despite the legal and related expenditures mentioned above other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant for 2008 as compared to 2007 this was primarily due to the continued achievement of cost containment objectives 

other income net remained relatively constant in 2008 when compared with 2007 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2008 was 394 as compared to 400 for 2007 

2007 compared with 2006 

airfreight services net revenues in 2007 increased 12 compared with 2006 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2007 increased 8 compared with 2006 airfreight yields expended 83 basis points a 4 increase as compared with 2006 the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 7 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight services net revenues from asia and from europe increased 17 and 9 respectively for 2007 compared with 2006 these changes are the result of market pricing and tonnage increases of 9 from asia and 3 from europe management attributes these tonnage increases to effective sales efforts 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus increased 15 over 2006 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 7 during the same period the difference between these two rates is a result of a yearoveryear decrease in ocean freight yields of 173 basis points an 8 decrease which were partially offset by yearoveryear increases in the company’s feebased order management and ocean forwarding business the primary reason for the decline in ocean freight yields was due to direct carrier cost increases that market conditions would not allow to be passed on in a timely manner 

the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 5 in 2007 compared to 2006 this was due to an increase in container traffic primarily from asia increases in ocean freight net revenues were primarily a result of increases in the order management and ocean forwarding business which were an outcome of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives ocean freight net revenues for asia and europe increased 6 and 10 respectively in 2007 as compared to 2006 these increases were also a result of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 16 in 2007 as compared with 2006 consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

salaries and related costs increased 13 in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels 

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2007 and 2006 are as follows 

 

 historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

other overhead expenses increased 11 in 2007 as compared with 2006 as rent expense communications expense process improvement and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations the company incurred legal and related expenses of 4 million in 2007 primarily attributable to the doj ongoing investigation of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in part i  item 3 on this report on form 10k entitled “legal proceedings” other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1 in 2007 as compared with 2006 

other income net increased 28 in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2007 interest income increased by 4 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2007 was 400 as compared to 406 for 2006 

  

currency and other risk factors 

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2008 2007 and 2006 was insignificant net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were 191 net unrealized foreign currency gains incurred in 2007 were 1300 net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2006 were 321 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 

sources of growth 

during 2008 the company opened 7 fullservice offices • and 4 satellite offices  as follows 

 

 suzhou people’s republic of china and milwaukee wisconsin converted from satellite offices to fullservice offices during 2008 

acquisitions  historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

internal growth  management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 409 million as compared with 313 million for 2007 this 96 million increase is primarily due to increased net earnings and a decrease in accounts receivable which outpaced the decrease in accounts payable and other accrued current liabilities 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 59 million as compared with 88 million during the same period of 2007 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2008 the company made capital expenditures of 60 million as compared with 83 million for the same period in 2007 capital expenditures in 2007 included 35 million for the purchase of 48300 square feet of office space in kowloon hong kong other capital expenditures in 2008 and 2007 related primarily to investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements total capital expenditures in 2009 are currently estimated to be 70 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate acquisitions and development although to a lesser extent than in the past few years the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2009 with cash 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 161 million as compared with 175 million in 2007 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market in 2008 the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared with the same period in 2007 is primarily due to fewer shares repurchased the proceeds from issuance of stock during 2008 were also significantly lower due to fewer aggregate shares exercised as compared to 2007 during 2008 and 2007 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 32 per share and 28 per share respectively 

at december 31 2008 working capital was 903 million including cash and shortterm investments of 742 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2008 the company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity the company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the recent disruption in the credit markets however if there is continued and expanded disruption in the credit markets there can be no assurance that the company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 

the company cannot forecast the potential impact that the recent disruptions in the world financial markets and associated credit tightening may have on the underlying global economy management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems the company cannot predict what fallout any of these disruptions might have on freight volumes due to changes in consumer demand or on customers’ abilities to pay 

  

the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2008 the united states facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit totaled 22 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 10 million which is available for issuances of standby letters of credit at december 31 2008 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 79 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

at december 31 2008 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

 

 the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2008 will be fulfilled during 2009 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

 

 the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2008 the company had repurchased and retired 18161750 shares of common stock at an average price of 1756 per share over the period from 1994 through 2008 during 2008 1255514 shares were repurchased at an average price of 3931 per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2008 the company had repurchased and retired 15590002 shares of common stock at an average price of 3236 per share over the period from 2001 through 2008 during 2008 2641423 shares were repurchased at an average price of 3969 these discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises 

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2008 cash and cash equivalent balances of 482 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 65 million was held in banks in the united states 

  

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2008 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s reporting currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2008 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 40 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 33 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and depress imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2008 the company had approximately 5 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2008 was insignificant net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were 191 net unrealized foreign currency gains incurred in 2007 were 1300 net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2006 were 321 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2008 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 742 million of which 397 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates there were no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2008 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2007 and 2008

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwexpeditorscom the company makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 

  

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 36 36 and 37 percent of the company’s 2007 2006 and 2005 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

  

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 24 25 and 25 percent of the company’s 2007 2006 and 2005 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

order management  previously referred to as ecms or expeditors cargo management system provides origin consolidation vendor management container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based and server based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual ex factory dates container utilization vendor performance and document visibility are many of the managed fun ctions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many vendors in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational process 

  

customs brokerage and other services 

  

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 40 39 and 38 percent of the company’s 2007 2006 and 2005 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

  

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects 

  

  

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s net revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly computerized customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

  

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

employees 

  

at january 31 2008 the company employed approximately 12310 people 4460 in the united states and 760 in the balance of north america 630 in south america 1640 in europe 3580 in asia  australasia 950 in the nearmiddle east and 290 in africa approximately 1720 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7420 in operations and 3170 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its nonequity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation and security 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

  

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states and additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by different governments in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

  

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvocc n on v essel o wned c ommon c arrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties

  

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the 

  

  

  

requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

  

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees while many of these regulations have not been finalized at this time it is the company’s position that much of the increased costs of compliance with security regulations will need to be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

  

cargo liability 

  

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 17 s pecial d rawing r ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

  

the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont based insurance entity wholly owned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2007 was approximately 4 million although actual and estimated losses are expected to be less in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

executive summary 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

  

  

  

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments taxation regional and global conflicts periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

  

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight 2 ocean freight and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

  

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility the americas asia europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair and australasia each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

  

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

  

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

  

as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources total capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to exceed 85 million 

  

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2007 the company operates in 61 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

  

·   total dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer service 

  

·   aggressive marketing of all of the company’s service offerings 

  

·   ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means 

  

·   creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvement 

  

·   individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and 

  

·   continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective 

  

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

  

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

  

critical accounting estimates   a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

  

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex challenges in accounting for operations 

  

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas 

  

·   accounts receivable valuation 

  

·   the useful lives of longterm assets 

  

·   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides 

  

·   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsured 

  

·   accrual of tax expense on an interim basis and 

  

·   calculation of sharebased compensation expense 

  

these estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates other than the calculation of sharebased compensation expense would not produce materially different results than those reported 

  

  

as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r this accounting standard requires the recognition of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and employee stock purchase plans this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the option vesting periods 

  

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option cancellations and the future interest rates and dividend yields 

  

the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options refer to note 4e in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the assumptions used by the company for estimating the fair value of options granted under sfas 123r were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants 

  

management believes that these assumptions are appropriate based upon the requirements of sfas 123r the guidance included in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 and the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

  

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

  

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense keeping all other variables constant the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option and the resulting stock compensation expense as follows 

  

 

  

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeitures assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 supplemented by fasb financial staff position 1571 and 2 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 157 beginning in the first quarter of 2008 except for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which it will adopt the provisions of sfas 157 in the first quarter of 2009 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 157 to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas 159 under the provisions of sfas 159 companies may choose to account for eligible financial instruments warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a contractbycontract basis changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting period sfas 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 159 beginning in the first quarter of 2008 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 159 to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” sfas 160 sfas 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity sfas 160 modifies the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 160 beginning in the first quarter of 2009 while the company is still assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas 160 it had minority interest of 17208 and 16275 as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively that it expects will be reclassified to equity under the provisions of sfas 160 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas 141r sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 141r beginning in the first quarter of 2009 the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas 141r the impact will depend upon the acquisitions if any the company consummates after the effective date 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2007 2006 and 2005 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

2007 compared with 2006 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2007 increased 12 compared with 2006 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2007 increased 8 compared with 2006 airfreight yields expanded 83 basis points a 4 increase as compared with 2006 the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 7 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 17 and 9 respectively for 2007 compared with 2006 these changes are the result of market pricing and tonnage increases of 9 from asia and 3 from europe management attributes these tonnage increases to effective sales efforts 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus increased 15 over 2006 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 7 during the same period the difference between these two rates is a result of a yearoveryear decrease in ocean freight yields of 173 basis points an 8 decrease which were partially offset by yearoveryear increases in the company’s feebased order management and ocean forwarding business the primary reason for the decline in ocean freight yields was due to direct carrier cost increases that market conditions would not allow to be passed on in a timely manner 

  

the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 5 in 2007 compared to 2006 this was due to an increase in container traffic primarily from asia increases in ocean freight net revenues were primarily a result of increases in the order management and ocean forwarding business which were an outcome of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives ocean freight net revenues for asia and europe increased 6 and 10 respectively in 2007 as compared to 2006 these increases were also a result of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives 

  

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 16 in 2007 as compared with 2006 consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

  

salaries and related costs increased 13 in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels 

  

the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2007 and 2006 are as follows 

  

 

  

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2007 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

other overhead expenses increased 11 in 2007 as compared with 2006 as rent expense communications expense process improvement and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1 in 2007 as compared with 2006 

  

other income net increased 28 in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2007 interest income increased by 4 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2007 was 400 as compared to 406 for 2006 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2006 increased 20 compared with 2005 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2006 increased 18 compared with 2005 airfreight yields remained relatively constant at 21 for 2006 as compared to 2005 the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 19 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 22 and 18 respectively for 2006 compared with 2005 these changes are the result of market pricing and tonnage increases of 19 from asia and 16 from europe management attributes these tonnage increases to effective sales efforts 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 20 over 2005 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 24 during the same period ocean freight yields increased 2 and 21 in 2006 as compared to 2005 

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased 28 in 2006 compared to 2005 ocean freight net revenues from asia increased 24 and from europe increased 12 for 2006 compared with 2005 the global increases in ocean freight net revenue are primarily a result of market share expansion 

  

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 22 in 2006 as compared with 2005 management believes this increase is attributable to increased market share as a result of the company’s reputation for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the customs brokerage market these opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities in addition the company’s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased emphasis on regulatory compliance 

  

salaries and related costs increased 18 in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels as previously noted the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified retrospective application method and has restated all periods presented to include compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated accordingly salaries and related costs for the year ended december 31 2005 have been increased to include compensation expense for the fair value of unvested stock options 

  

the decline in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2006 as compared with the same period for 2005 can be attributed to leveraging increased business volumes with improved productivity and increasing overall efficiency through technological advances the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2006 and 2005 are as follows 

  

 

  

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee 

  

other overhead expenses increased 10 in 2006 as compared with 2005 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1 in 2006 as compared with 2005 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level 

  

other income net increased 31 in 2006 as compared with 2005 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2006 interest income increased by 7 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2006 of 406 increased when compared with the 312 rate in 2005 the lower tax rate in 2005 is primarily the result of the company adopting a plan under internal revenue code irc 965 which was added by the american jobs creation act in accordance with irc 965 the company recorded a onetime tax benefit of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to qualify for this credit the company adopted a plan which required qualified capital expenditures of approximately 105 million the company completed the required capital expenditures during 2006 additionally income tax expense in 2005 has been restated to include the tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense recorded as a result of applying the requirements of sfas 123r under the modified retrospective method although a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation expense is recorded for nonqualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2006 as compared to 2005 is partially the result of a smaller tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options during 2006 than was realized 2005 

  

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a still a trend of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2007 2006 and 2005 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2007 were 1300 net foreign currency losses realized in 2006 were 321 net foreign currency gains realized in 2005 were 862 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

sources of growth 

  

during 2007 the company opened 7 fullservice offices  ·  and 5 satellite offices  as follows 

  

   

chongqing people’s republic of china prc and yantai prc converted from satellite offices to fullservice offices during 2007 

  

acquisitions  historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

internal growth  management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 313 million as compared with 333 million for 2006 this 20 million decrease is principally due to an increase in accounts receivable which outpaced the increase in accounts payable and increased net earnings additionally this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a smaller increase in taxes payable net of prepaid taxes 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

  

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 88 million as compared with 143 million during the same period of 2006 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2007 the company made capital expenditures of 83 million as compared with 139 million for the same period in 2006 capital expenditures in 2007 included 35 million for the purchase of 48300 square feet of office space in kowloon hong kong capital expenditures in 2006 included 67 million for the acquisition of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in miami florida and real estate development expenditures of 22 million related to projects in seattle washington and houston texas other capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 related primarily to investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements total capital expenditures in 2008 are currently estimated to be 85 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate acquisitions and development although to a lesser extent than in the past few years the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2008 with cash 

  

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 175 million as compared with 160 million for the same period in 2006 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market in 2007 the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to prevent growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the same period in 2006 is primarily the result of this policy during 2007 and 2006 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 28 per share and 22 per share respectively 

  

at december 31 2007 working capital was 765 million including cash and shortterm investments of 575 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2007 

  

the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2007 the united states facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credittotaled 19 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 14 million which is available for issuances of standby letters of credit at december 31 2007 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 74 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

  

  

at december 31 2007 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

  

   

the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2007 will be fulfilled during 2008 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

  

   

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2007 the company had repurchased and retired 16906236 shares of common stock at an average price of 1594 per share over the period from 1994 through 2007 during 2007 1498763 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4378 per share

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

  

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2007 cash and cash equivalent balances of 395 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 50 million was held in banks in the united states 

  

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2007 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

  




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s reporting currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2007 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 36 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 29 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and depress imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

  

as of december 31 2007 the company had approximately 6 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2007 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2007 were 1300 net foreign currency losses realized in 2006 were 321 net foreign currency gains realized in 2005 were 862 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2007 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 575 million of which 1 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates there were no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2007 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2006 and 2007

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400

the company’s internet address is httpwwwexpeditorscom the company makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

airfreight services 

airfreight services accounted for approximately 37 37 and 39 percent of the company’s 2006 2005 and 2004 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain 

a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

ocean freight and ocean services 

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 25 25 and 23 percent of the company’s 2006 2005 and 2004 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

customs brokerage and other services 

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 38 percent of each of the company’s 2006 2005 and 2004 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by customs and border protection of the department of homeland security in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

marketing and customers 

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

competition 

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

currency and other risk factors 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

environmental 

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years

at january 31 2007 the company employed approximately 11600 people 4390 in the united states and 660 in the balance of north america 590 in south america 1570 in europe 3250 in asia  australasia 850 in the nearmiddle east and 290 in africa approximately 1650 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 7100 in operations and 2850 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory

regulation and security 

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp additionally the company participates in government supply chain security programs such as customstrade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” in the united states in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary “oti” sometimes referred to as nvoccnonvessel owned common carrier by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions 

and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

the war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years while these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees while many of these regulations have not been finalized at this time it is the company’s position that much of the increased costs of compliance with security regulations will need to be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the company’s services 

cargo liability 

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 907 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont based insurance entity wholly owned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2006 was approximately 4 million although actual and estimated losses are expected to be less in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments taxation regional and global conflicts periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight 2 ocean freight and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility the americas asia europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair and australasia each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

the company’s operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these 

factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources total capital expenditures in 2007 are expected to exceed 106 million 

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2006 the company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

·   total dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer service 

·   aggressive marketing of all of the company’s service offerings 

·   ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means 

·   creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvement 

·   individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and 

·   continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective 

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

critical accounting estimates a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex challenges in accounting for operations 

  

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

·   accounts receivable valuation

·   the useful lives of longterm assets

·   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides

·   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsured and

·   accrual of tax expense on an interim basis

management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r this accounting standard requires the recognition of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 

this expense is recorded ratably over the option vesting periods the company elected to utilize the modified retrospective method of adoption and has restated all prior periods to recognize the required stock compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of sfas 123r 

determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and the interest rates and dividend yields 

the company has historically used the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options in providing pro forma fair value disclosures pursuant to sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 after a review of alternatives and considering the guidance outlined in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 the company has decided to continue to use this model for estimating the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas 123r 

in reviewing the propriety of measurements and assumptions used historically to calculate compensation expense for disclosure purposes management considered the guidance contained in sab 107 even though all the company’s stock options had previously been granted under sfas 123 as opposed to sfas 123r for which sab 107 was expressly written the company began granting options under sfas 123r in the second quarter of 2006 refer to note 5d in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the assumptions used by the company for estimating the fair value of options granted under sfas 123r were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants 

management believes that these assumptions are appropriate based upon the requirements of sfas 123 sfas 123r the guidance included in sab 107 and the company’s historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material 

the company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical experience the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns 

the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense keeping all other variables constant the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option and the resulting stock compensation expense as follows 

 

the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeitures assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf issue 063 “how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement” eitf 063 the scope of eitf 063 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer including but not limited to sales and valueadded taxes in eitf 063 a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis if these taxes are significant an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of taxes if reflected on a gross basis in the income statement eitf 063 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2006 the company is required to and plans to adopt eitf 063 in the first quarter of 2007 the company presents revenues net of sales and valueadded taxes in its consolidated statement of earnings and does not anticipate changing its policy as a result of the adoption of eitf 063 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 the interpretation establishes guidelines for recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of fin 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 the company does not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 157 beginning in the first quarter of 2008 the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas 157 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas 159 under the provisions of sfas 159 companies may choose to account for eligible financial instruments warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a contractbycontract basis changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting period sfas 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas 159 beginning in the first quarter of 2008 the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas 159 

results of operations 

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2006 2005 and 2004 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

 2006 compared with 2005 

airfreight net revenues in 2006 increased 20 compared with 2005 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2006 increased 18 compared with 2005 airfreight yields remained relatively constant at 21 for 2006 as compared to 2005 the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 19 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 22 and 18 respectively for 2006 compared with 2005 these changes are the result of market pricing and tonnage increases of 19 from asia and 16  from europe management attributes these tonnage increases to effective sales efforts 

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 20 over 2005 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 24 during the same period ocean freight yields increased 2 to 21 in 2006 as compared to 2005 

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased 28 in 2006 compared to 2005 ocean freight net revenues from asia increased 24 and from europe increased 12 for 2006 compared with 2005 the global increases in ocean freight net revenue are primarily a result of market share expansion 

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 20 in 2006 as compared with 2005 management believes this increase is attributable to increased market share as a result of the company’s reputation for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the customs brokerage market these opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities in addition the company’s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased emphasis on regulatory compliance 

salaries and related costs increased 18 in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels as previously noted the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified retrospective application method and has restated all periods presented to include compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated accordingly salaries and related costs for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 have been increased to include compensation expense for the fair value of unvested stock options 

the decline in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2006 as compared with the same period for 2005 can be attributed to leveraging increased business volumes with improved productivity and increasing overall efficiency through technological advances the effect of including stockbased compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2006 and 2005 are as follows 

 

historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2006 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program

2005 compared with 2004 

airfreight net revenues in 2005 increased 12 compared with 2004 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2005 increased 9 compared with 2004 the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2005 was primarily a result of air carrier fuel surcharges which the company typically passes on without a profit element the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 13 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 15 and 8 respectively for 2005 compared with 2004 these increases are the result of market price increases partially offset by yield declines of less than 1 and increased tonnage of 13 from asia and 2 from europe primarily as a result of increased sales success 

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 18 over 2004 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 23 during the same period the increase in net revenue can be attributed to cyclical market conditions and trade lane imbalances

currency and other risk factors 

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2006 2005 and 2004 was insignificant net foreign currency losses realized in 2006 were 321 net foreign currency gains realized in 2005 and 2004 were 862 and 86 respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2006 and 2005 

sources of growth 

during 2006 the company opened 2 fullservice offices • and 6 satellite offices  as follows 

 

xi’an people’s republic of china prc converted from a satellite office to a fullservice office during 2006 

acquisitions  historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

internal growth  management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

 liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 333 million as compared with 267 million for 2005 this 66 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings the increase in taxes payable net of prepaid taxes is the result of higher tax liabilities on higher earnings and lower relative amounts of estimated tax payments 

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 143 million as compared with 91 million during the same period of 2005 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2006 the company made capital expenditures of 141 million as compared with 91 million for the same period in 2005 capital expenditures in 2006 included 67 million for the acquisition of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in miami florida in addition the company had real estate development expenditures of 22 million related to projects in seattle washington and houston texas other capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 related primarily to investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements the company currently expects to spend approximately 43 million for normal capital expenditures in 2007 in addition to property and equipment normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements warehouse equipment computer hardware and furniture and fixtures total capital expenditures in 2007 are currently estimated to be 106 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate acquisitions and development the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2007 with cash 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 160 million as compared with 107 million for the same period in 2005 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market in 2006 the company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to prevent growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with the same period in 2005 is primarily the result of this policy during 2006 and 2005 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 22 per share and 15 per share respectively 

at december 31 2006 working capital was 633 million including cash and shortterm investments of 512 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2006 

the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2006 the united states facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit excluding the uk bank facility totaled 18 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 14 million which is available for shortterm borrowings and issuances of standby letters of credit at december 31 2006 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 63 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations 

the guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

at december 31 2006 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

 the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2006 will be fulfilled during 2007 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

 the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2006 the company had repurchased and retired 15407473 shares of common stock at an average price of 1324 per share over the period from 1994 through 2006 during 2006 1105773 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4420 per share 

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2006 the company had repurchased and retired 9752196 shares of common stock at an average price of 2643 per share over the period from 2001 through 2006 during 2006 2825042 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4492 these discretionary repurchases were made to keep the number of issued and outstanding shares from growing as a result of stock option exercises 

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2006 cash and cash equivalent balances of 345 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 46 million was held in banks in the united states 

impact of inflation 

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2006 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

foreign exchange risk 

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s reporting currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2006 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 22 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 18 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and depress imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

as of december 31 2006 the company had approximately 2 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2006 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2006 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 512 million of which 1 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates there were no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2006 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2005 and 2006

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 37 39 and 37 percent of the company’s 2005 2004 and 2003 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain 

  

  

a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated 

shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 38 38 and 37 percent of the company’s 2005 2004 and 2003 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

  

during 1996 the company established a subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc to respond to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by customs and border protection of the department of homeland security in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 25 23 and 26 percent of the company’s 2005 2004 and 2003 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

  

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

  

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

unlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy 

  

  

emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

employees 

  

at january 31 2006 the company employed approximately 10600 people 3900 in the united states and 625 in the balance of north america 525 in south america 1460 in europe 2900 in asia  australasia 900 in the nearmiddle east and 290 in africa approximately 1500 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 6525 in operations and 2575 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation safety administration of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

  

the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection “cbp” of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

  

  

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc 

has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

  

the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

  

cargo liability 

  

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 907 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

  

the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont based insurance entity wholly owned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2005 was approximately 3 million although actual and estimated losses are expected to be less this selfretention will increase to 4 million as of february 2006 in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

executive summary 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

  

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the affects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

  

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight 2 ocean freight and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

  

the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility the americas asia europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair and australasia each area is divided into subregions which are composed of several operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation between operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company’s overall success on a standalone basis 

  

the company’s operating units share revenue according to armslength industry conventions the company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

  

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these 

  

  

factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in 

revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources total capital expenditures in 2006 are expected to exceed 165 million 

  

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2005 the company operates in 58 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

  

•   total dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer service

•   aggressive marketing of all of the company’s service offerings

•   ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means

•   creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvement

•   individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and

•   continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective

  

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

  

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

  

critical accounting estimates   

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in this 

10k 

  

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex measurement issues or challenges in accounting for operations 

  

  

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

  

•   accounts receivable valuation 

•   the useful lives of longterm assets 

•   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides 

•   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsured and 

•   accrual of tax expense on an interim basis 

  

management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 and supercedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period of the registrants first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 with early adoption encouraged in addition sfas no 123r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amount in the company’s pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period the company has adopted sfas no 123r as of january 1 2006 under sfas no 123r the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption the company will continue to use the blackscholes model for valuing option expense and will amortize the compensation expense using the straightline prorated method the company has elected to use the modified retrospective method of transitioning to sfas no 123r under the modified retrospective method beginning with the report on form 10q for the first quarter of 2006 the company will restate all periods presented the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet the consolidated results of operations earnings per share and consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2005 2004 and 2003 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

2005 compared with 2004 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2005 increased 12 compared with 2004 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2005 increased 9 compared with 2004 the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2005 was primarily a result of air carrier fuel surcharges which the company typically passes on without a profit element the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 13 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 15 and 8 respectively for 2005 compared with 2004 these increases are the result of market price increases partially offset by yield declines of less than 1 and increased tonnage of 13 from asia and 2 from europe primarily as a result of increased sales success 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 18 over 2004 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 23 during the same period the increase in net revenue can be attributed to cyclical market conditions and trade lane imbalances 

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased 22 in 2005 compared to 2004 ocean freight net revenues from asia increased 31 and from europe decreased 1 for 2005 compared with 2004 the increase in north american and asian ocean freight net revenue are primarily a result of greater market share the decrease experienced in europe is primarily due to decreased export volumes which can be attributable to the relative value of european currencies throughout the year 

  

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 18 in 2005 as compared with 2004 this is a result of the company’s reputation for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the customs brokerage market these opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities in addition the company’s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased emphasis on regulatory compliance 

  

salaries and related costs increased 16 in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2005 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

this trend may not continue in 2006 and future years as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r which requires the expensing of the fair value of employee stock options management expects salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenues will be more volatile 

  

other operating expenses increased 6 in 2005 as compared with 2004 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2 in 2005 as compared with 2004 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level 

  

other income net increased 83 in 2005 as compared with 2004 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2005 interest income increased by 6 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2005 of 296 decreased when compared with the 354 rate in 2004 the lower tax rate in 2005 is primarily the result of the company adopting a plan under internal revenue code irc 965 which was added by the american jobs creation act in accordance with irc 965 the company recorded a onetime tax benefit of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to qualify for this credit the company adopted a plan which requires qualified capital expenditures of approximately 105 million over the next two to three years 

  

2004 compared with 2003 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2004 increased 25 compared with 2003 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2004 increased 23 compared with 2003 the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2004 was primarily a result of air carriers increasing their rates such that the company was unable to increase its corresponding rates to customers in a timely and effective manner as with the second half of 2003 the company elected to absorb these shortterm decreases in the interest of maintaining longterm customer relationships the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 25 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase is partly a recovery of the prior year decrease and partly the result of increased exports from the united states due to the weakening of the us dollar airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 37 and 23 respectively for 2004 compared with 2003 these increases are the result of market price increases partially offset by yield declines of less than 1 and increased tonnage of 26 from asia and 18 from europe primarily as a result of increased sales success 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 29 over 2003 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased only 10 during the same period the difference in these two growth rates is a result of a 200 basis point reduction in ocean freight yields 

  

the reduction in a yield is a function of two major factors 

•   revenue from ecms in 2004 increased only 2 over 2003 because of rate pressures on vendor consolidation fees

•   a series of rate increases put forward by direct ocean freight carriers throughout 2004 due to market conditions primarily related to capacity these rate increases because of magnitude and frequency could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased in 2004 compared to 2003 ocean freight net revenues from asia and from europe increased 22 and 8 respectively for 2004 compared with 2003 

  

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 23 in 2004 as compared with 2003 this is a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance has benefited the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

  

salaries and related costs increased 20 in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2004 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

other operating expenses increased 12 in 2004 as compared with 2003 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  

  

other income net decreased 4 in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2004 interest income increased by 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 rental income net of applicable depreciation of 26 million and 34 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively is included in other income the rental income is derived from two of the company’s properties one located near heathrow airport in london england and an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport as a result of the scheduled remodeling of the san francisco california office and warehouse facility rental income from that property ceased at the end of the first quarter of 2004 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2004 of 354 decreased when compared with the 364 rate in 2003 the lower tax rate in 2004 is the result of the decreased state tax expense caused by an increase in the taxable income sourced outside the united states and certain accounting adjustments made in 2003 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental 

  

  

interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move 

money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2005 2004 and 2003 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2005 2004 and 2003 were 862 86 and 588 respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and other services historically this annual filing has gone on to state that in light of the customerdriven trend to provide customer rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company we now believe we were wrong about this 

  

sources of growth 

  

during 2005 the company opened 12 fullservice offices • and 5 satellite offices  as follows 

  

   

ningbo surabaya and johor bahru converted from satellites to fullservice offices in 2005 

  

acquisitions  historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

internal growth  management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 280 million as compared with 193 million for 2004 this 87 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings and deferred tax expense on unremitted foreign earnings the increased accounts receivable is offset by increased accounts payable accrued expenses and taxes payable increased accounts receivable is primarily due to higher billings in november and december 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004 increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a result of the company’s attempts to manage cash flows by matching the timing of cash outflows for payments to vendors with cash inflows from collections of customer billings 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity 

associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash due to the company’s management of accounts payable and accrued expenses as described in the preceding paragraph cash flow from operating activities remained positive 

  

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 91 million as compared with 65 million during the same period of 2004 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 

for the year ended december 31 2005 the company made capital expenditures of 91 million as compared with 66 million for the same period in 2004 capital expenditures in 2005 included 23 million for acquisitions of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in houston texas and seattle washington in addition the company had real estate development expenditures of 42 million related to projects in san francisco and los angeles california seattle washington and houston texas other capital expenditures in 2005 and 2004 related primarily to investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements the company currently expects to spend approximately 27 million for normal capital expenditures in 2006 in addition to property and equipment normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements warehouse equipment computer hardware and furniture and fixtures total capital expenditures in 2006 are currently estimated to be 165 million this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above plus additional real estate acquisitions and development required to carry out the company’s plan adopted under irc 965 the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2006 with cash 

  

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 120 million as compared with 22 million for the same period in 2004 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market in 2005 the company established a policy of repurchasing stock to prevent growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with the same period in 2004 is primarily the result of this new policy during 2005 and 2004 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 30 per share and 22 per share respectively 

  

at december 31 2005 working capital was 589 million including cash and shortterm investments of 464 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2005 

  

the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2005 the united states facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit excluding the uk bank facility totaled 11 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 12 million which is available for shortterm borrowings and issuances of standby letters of credit at december 31 2005 the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit but was contingently liable for 56 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations the guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for 

  

  

customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

  

at december 31 2005 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

  

   

the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2005 will be fulfilled during 2006 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

  

   

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2005 the company had repurchased and retired 7150850 shares of common stock at an average price of 2168 per share over the period from 1994 through 2005 during 2005 723135 shares were repurchased at an average price of 5690 per share 

  

the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2005 the company had repurchased and retired 3463577 shares of common stock at an average price of 3777 per share over the period from 2001 through 2005 during 2005 1463577 shares were repurchased at an average price of 5856 these discretionary repurchases were made to keep the number of issued and outstanding shares from growing as a result of stock option exercises 

  

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

  

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2005 cash and cash equivalent balances of 263 million were held by the company’s nonunited states subsidiaries of which 17 million was held in banks in the united states 

  

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2005 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of securities and exchange commission sec regulation sk 

  




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2005 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 24 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 19 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and depress imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact affect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions 

  

as of december 31 2005 the company had approximately 2 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2005 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2005 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 464 million of which 342 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates there were no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2005 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2004 and 2005

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the far east to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 39 37 and 42 percent of the company’s 2004 2003 and 2002 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment 

  

  

increases  as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

  

customs brokerage and other services 

  

customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 38 37 and 34 percent of the company’s 2004 2003 and 2002 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution time definite transportation and inventory management none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company’s net revenues 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

  

during 1996 the company established a subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc to respond to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the us customs service in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23 26 and 24 percent of the company’s 2004 2003 and 2002 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the far east to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

  

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

  

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

  

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

employees 

  

at january 31 2005 the company employed approximately 9400 people 3400 in the united states and 600 in the balance of north america 450 in south america 1450 in europe 2500 in the far east  australasia 800 in the nearmiddle east and 200 in africa approximately 1300 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 5850 in operations and 2250 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory

regulation 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the department of transportation “dot” as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members

the company does not believe that current us and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority usowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

executive summary 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

  

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the affects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

  

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and other services and these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

  

customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop to the degree possible practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in 

  

  

revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock

  

as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources total capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to exceed 100 million 

  

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management focused on in 2004 the company operates in 57 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

  

•   total dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer service

•   aggressive marketing of all of the company’s service offerings

•   ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means

•   creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvement

•   individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and

•   continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective

  

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

  

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

  

critical accounting estimates   a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

  

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex measurement issues or challenges in accounting for operations 

  

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

•   accounts receivable valuation 

•   the useful lives of longterm assets 

•   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides 

•   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsured and 

•   accrual of tax expense on an interim basis 

  

management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

  

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities revised an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46r fin 46r addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in fin 46r the provisions of fin 46r are generally effective for public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as specialpurpose entities for periods ending after december 15 2003 application by public entities other than small business issuers for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march 15 2004 the company adopted only the disclosure provisions of fin 46r in the fourth quarter of 2003 and adopted the remaining provisions of fin 46r in the first quarter of 2004 the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin 46r did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 and supercedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2005 with early adoption encouraged in addition sfas no 123r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amount in the company’s pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period the company is required to adopt sfas no 123r in the third quarter of 2005 beginning july 1 2005 under sfas no 123r the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption the transition alternatives include prospective and retrospective adoption methods under the retrospective methods prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 123r while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas no 123r and expects the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations earnings per share and consolidated statement of cash flows the company has not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no 123r 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” which provides guidance under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs act on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability the jobs act was enacted on october 22 2004 the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations fsp no 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 109 the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions in the act as such the company is not yet in a position to determine to what extent the company will repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us and as provided for in fsp no 1092 the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act the company will complete its evaluation and quantification in 2005 since the company has provided us taxes on all unremitted foreign earnings the repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the repatriations provisions of the jobs act would result in a reduction of the company’s tax expense and deferred tax liability 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2004 2003 and 2002 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

2004 compared with 2003 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2004 increased 25 compared with 2003 primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes global airfreight tonnages in 2004 increased 23 compared with 2003 the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2004 was primarily a result of air carriers increasing their rates such that the company was unable to increase its corresponding rates to customers in a timely and effective manner as with the second half of 2003 the company elected to absorb these shortterm decreases in the interest of maintaining longterm customer relationships the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 25 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase is partly a recovery of the prior year decrease and partly the result of increased exports from the united states due to the weakening of the us dollar airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 37 and 23 respectively for 2004 compared with 2003 these increases are the result of market price increases partially offset by yield declines of less than 1 and increased tonnage of 26 from the far east and 18 from europe primarily as a result of increased sales success 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 29 over 2003 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased only 10 during the same period the difference in these two growth rates is a result of a 200 basis point reduction in ocean freight yields 

  

the reduction in a yield is a function of two major factors 

•   revenue from expeditors cargo management ecms in 2004 increased only 2 over 2003 because of rate pressures on vendor consolidation fees

•   a series of rate increases put forward by direct ocean freight carriers throughout 2004 due to market conditions primarily related to capacity these rate increases because of magnitude and frequency could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to 

  

  

obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level the company’s north american ocean freight net revenues increased 8 in 2004 compared to 2003 ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 22 and 8 respectively for 2004 compared with 2003

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 23 in 2004 as compared with 2003 this is a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program in addition increased emphasis on regulatory compliance has benefited the company’s customs brokerage offerings 

  

salaries and related costs increased 20 in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2004 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

this trend may not continue in 2005 and future years as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r which requires the expensing of the fair value of employee stock options effective in the third quarter of 2005 management expects salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenues will be more volatile 

  

other operating expenses increased 12 in 2004 as compared with 2003 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  

  

other income net decreased 4 in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2004 interest income increased by 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 rental income net of applicable depreciation of 26 million and 34 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively is included in other income the rental income is derived from two of the company’s properties one located near heathrow airport in london england and an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport as a result of the scheduled remodeling of the san francisco california office and warehouse facility rental income from that property ceased at the end of the first quarter of 2004 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2004 of 354 decreased when compared with the 364 rate in 2003 the lower tax rate in 2004 is the result of the decreased state tax expense caused by an increase in the taxable income sourced outside the us and certain accounting adjustments made in 2003 as described in the following section if the company adopts a plan under internal revenue code irc 965 which was added by the jobs act the company’s 2005 tax rate will be lower than prior years this lower tax rate will only affect 2005 

  

2003 compared with 2002 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2003 decreased 2 compared with 2002 global airfreight tonnages in 2003 were comparable with those in 2002 the decrease in 2003 airfreight net revenues was a reflection of an overall decline in airfreight yields and an inability to increase 2003 airfreight tonnages beyond those levels experienced in 2002 airfreight tonnages and yields in 2002 were an anomaly as the airfreight markets were swamped by cargo that would otherwise have moved by ocean but did not due to the disruption caused by the labor disputes in the west coast ports of the united states the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2003 was primarily a result of air carriers increasing their rates such that the company was unable to increase its corresponding rates to customers in a timely and effective manner the company elected to absorb these shortterm decreases in the interest of maintaining longterm customer relationships the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues decreased 5 in 2003 compared to 2002 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe decreased 11 and increased 26 respectively for 2003 compared with 2002 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalents feus increased 23 over 2002 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased only 16 during the same period the difference in these two growth rates is a result of a 252 basis point decline in ocean freight yields in may 2003 ocean freight carriers implemented substantial rate increases in order to gain market share and maintain its focus on longterm customer relationships the company chose not to immediately pass on the full rate increases the resulting increase in ocean freight volumes more than offset the revenue foregone by not implementing the full rate increases 

  

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level ecms continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues decreased 3 in 2003 compared to 2002 this decrease was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east a market which has lower profit per container and to a lesser extent from north america to europe a market which has higher profit per container ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 24 respectively for 2003 compared with 2002 

  

customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 20 in 2003 as compared with 2002 as a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program 

  

salaries and related costs increased 11 in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of 1 the company’s increased albeit limited hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues 

  

other operating expenses increased in 2003 as compared with 2002 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant in 2003 as compared with 2002 

  

other income net increased in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to much lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2003 interest income decreased by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2003 rental income net of applicable depreciation of 34 million for the year ended december 31 2003 is included in other income the rental income is derived from two of the company’s properties one located near heathrow airport in london england and an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport other income in the year ended december 31 2002 includes the 15 million gain on the sale of the company’s former dublin ireland facility 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2003 of 364 is comparable to the 365 rate in 2002 in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company recorded additional tax expense of 95 million in order to provide full us taxation on approximately 419 million of foreign earnings accumulated through december 31 1992 for which us income taxes had not previously been provided income taxes had not previously been provided on these earnings as a result of the company’s previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred also during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company eliminated 8 million of certain taxes which the company had previously expected to pay upon analysis of the state tax implications of the company’s pattern of remitting foreign earnings the company has determined that these taxes were not owed 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control 

  

  

regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2004 2003 and 2002 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2004 2003 and 2002 were 86 588 and 70 respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2004 and 2003

  

the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and other services in light of the customerdriven trend to provide customer rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

sources of growth 

  

historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

office additions 

  

the company opened 2 startup offices during 2004 

  

   

during 2004 the company closed its offices in curitiba and belo horizonte brazil these two offices were converted to nonexclusive agents 

  

internal growth 

  

management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was approximately 193 million as compared with 114 million for 2003 this 79 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings the tax benefit of nonqualified stock option exercises and deferred tax expense on unremitted foreign earnings the increased accounts receivable is offset by increased accounts payable accrued expenses and taxes payable increased accounts receivable is primarily due to higher billings in november and december 2004 compared to the same periods in 2003 and slower collections on certain large technology accounts required to meet current market conditions increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a result of the company’s attempts to manage cash flows by matching the timing of cash outflows for payments to vendors with cash inflows from collections of customer billings 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash due to the company’s management of accounts payable and accrued expenses as described in the preceding paragraph cash flow from operating activities remained positive 

  

  

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the bureau of customs and border protection these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 65 million as compared with 26 million during the same period of 2003 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2004 the company made capital expenditures of 66 million as compared with 21 million for the same period in 2003 capital expenditures in 2004 included 24 million for acquisitions of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in new york california and korea other capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 related primarily to investments in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements cash of 313 million was paid into escrow during 2002 to acquire an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport the transaction closed on january 7 2003 the company currently expects to spend approximately 30 million for normal capital expenditures in 2005 in addition to property and equipment normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements warehouse equipment computer hardware and furniture and fixtures total capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to exceed 100 million if the company adopts a plan calling for capital expenditures to meet the investment requirements of irc 965 the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2005 with cash 

  

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 22 million as compared with 18 million for the same period in 2003 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market the differences between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares in november 2001 the board of directors voted to allow the repurchase under a discretionary plan of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100000000 shares of common stock no repurchases were made under this plan in 2004 and 2003 during 2004 and 2003 the net use of cash in financing activities was primarily for the payment of dividends of 22 per share and 16 per share respectively 

  

at december 31 2004 working capital was 522 million including cash and shortterm investments of 409 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2004 while the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment the company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations 

  

the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2004 the us facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit totaled 135 million in addition the company maintains bank facilities with uk banks for 23 million at december 31 2004 the company was directly liable for 23 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional 827 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations the guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

  

  

at december 31 2004 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

  

  

   

  

the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2004 will be fulfilled during 2005 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

  

  

   

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2004 the company had repurchased and retired 6427715 shares of common stock at an average price of 1772 per share over the period from 1994 through 2004 during 2004 612533 shares were repurchased at an average price of 4762 per share 

  

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

  

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2004 cash and cash equivalent balances of 2395 million were held by the company’s nonus subsidiaries of which 439 million was held in banks in the united states 

  

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of securities and exchange commission sec regulation sk 

  

  




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2004 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 19 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 15 million 

  

the company has approximately 6 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions at any one point in time the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2004 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2004 and 2003 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2004 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 409 million and shortterm borrowings of 23 million all subject to variable shortterm interest rates a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would have an insignificant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2003 and 2004 

  

  




 item 9 — changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the far east to the united states and related customs brokerage and import services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 37 42 and 42 percent of the company’s 2003 2002 and 2001 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated 

  

 

shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 

  

customs brokerage and import services 

  

customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 37 34 and 35 percent of the company’s 2003 2002 and 2001 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing inland transportation inventory management cargo insurance and product distribution 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 

  

during 1996 the company established a subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc to respond to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the us customs service in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

  

there is a noticeable trend prompted by customer demand to quote rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 26 24 and 23 percent of the company’s 2003 2002 and 2001 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the far east to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits lessthan container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

  

 

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

employees 

  

at january 31 2004 the company employed approximately 8600 people 2950 in the united states and 525 in the balance of north america 425 in south america 1345 in europe 2450 in the far east  australasia 725 in the nearmiddle east and 180 in africa approximately 1150 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 4500 in operations and 2950 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the department of transportation “dot” as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

  

the company is licensed as a customs broker by the customs service of the department of the treasury in each us customs district in which it does business all us customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the customs service in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

  

 

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc 

has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the us the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

  

the company does not believe that current us and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority usowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

  

cargo liability 

  

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 907 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability

the company derives its revenues from three principal sources airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services and these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

  

customs brokerage and import services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree a good reputation helps to develop to the degree possible practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in 

  

 

revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

in terms of the opportunities challenges and risks that management is focused on in 2004 the company operates in 56 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands 

  

•   total dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer service

•   aggressive marketing of all of the company’s service offerings

•   ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means

•   creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvement

•   individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and

•   continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective

  

the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 

  

any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the company’s continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates   

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

  

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex challenges in accounting for operations revenue recognition is considered the critical accounting policy due to the complexity of arranging and managing global logistics and supplychain management transactions 

  

 

revenue recognition 

  

airfreight revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges 

  

based upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues an hawb or an hobl are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time 

  

revenues realized in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue an hawb or an hobl include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed these revenues are recognized upon completion of the services similarly revenues related to customs brokerage and import services are recognized upon completion of the services 

  

arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company may perform multiple services these services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service 

  

typically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as “doortodoor service” this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the company’s branches are independent profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate are done in an objective manner on a fair value basis in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

  

estimates   

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

•   accounts receivable valuation 

•   the useful lives of longterm assets 

•   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides 

•   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsured and 

•   accrual of tax expense on an interim basis 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company provided full us taxation on approximately 419 million of foreign earnings accumulated through december 31 1992 for which us income taxes had not previously been provided resulting in additional tax expense of 95 million income taxes had not previously been provided on these earnings as a result of the company’s previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred the company’s decision to provide us taxes on all unremitted foreign earnings was made based upon the desire to be able to deploy capital globally without concern for the impact of associated us tax obligations that might be incurred as a result of the repatriation of these earnings management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2003 2002 and 2001 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

2003 compared with 2002 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2003 decreased 2 compared with 2002 global airfreight tonnages in 2003 were comparable with those in 2002 the decrease in 2003 airfreight net revenues was a reflection of an overall decline in airfreight yields and an inability to increase 2003 airfreight tonnages beyond those levels experienced in 2002 airfreight tonnages and yields in 2002 were an anomaly as the airfreight markets were swamped by cargo that would otherwise have moved by ocean but did not due to the disruption caused by the labor disputes in the west coast ports of the united states the 1 decrease in airfreight yields in 2003 was primarily a result of air carriers increasing their rates such that the company was unable to increase its corresponding rates to customers in a timely and effective manner the company elected to absorb these shortterm decreases in the interest of maintaining longterm customer relationships the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues decreased 5 in 2003 compared to 2002 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe decreased 11 and increased 26 respectively for 2003 compared with 2002 

  

ocean freight volumes measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus increased 23 over 2002 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased only 16 during the same period the difference in these two growth rates is a result of a 252 basis point decline in ocean freight yields in may 2003 ocean freight carriers implemented substantial rate increases in order to gain market share and maintain its focus on longterm customer relationships the company chose not to immediately pass on the full rate increases the resulting increase in ocean freight volumes more than offset the revenue foregone by not implementing the full rate increases 

  

the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to 

  

 

obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level expeditors cargo management systems ecms an ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues decreased 3 in 2003 compared to 2002 this decrease was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east a market which has lower profit per container and to a lesser extent from north america to europe a market which has higher profit per container ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 24 respectively for 2003 compared with 2002 

  

customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 20 in 2003 as compared with 2002 as a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program 

  

salaries and related costs increased 11 in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of 1 the company’s increased albeit limited hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2003 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

other operating expenses increased in 2003 as compared with 2002 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant in 2003 as compared with 2002 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  

  

other income net increased in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to much lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2003 interest income decreased by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2003 rental income net of applicable depreciation of 34 million for the year ended december 31 2003 is included in other income the rental income is derived from two of the company’s properties one located near heathrow airport in london england and an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport other income in the year ended december 31 2002 includes the 15 million gain on the sale of the company’s former dublin ireland facility 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2003 of 364 is comparable to the 365 rate in 2002 in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company recorded additional tax expense of 95 million in order to provide full us taxation on approximately 419 million of foreign earnings accumulated through december 31 1992 for which us income taxes had not previously been provided income taxes had not previously been provided on these earnings as a result of the company’s previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred also during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company eliminated 8 million of certain taxes which the company had previously expected to pay upon recent analysis of the state tax implications of the company’s pattern of remitting foreign earnings the company has determined that these taxes are not owed 

  

2002 compared with 2001 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2002 increased 12 compared with 2001 primarily due to increased airfreight tonnages handled in 2002 as compared with 2001 airfreight margins decreased approximately 2 during 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of rate increases initiated by air carriers during the third and fourth quarters in response to excess air cargo demands associated with the port disruptions on the west coast of the united states efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues decreased 2 in 2002 compared to 2001 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 22 and 12 respectively for 2002 compared with 2001 airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes the company’s most dominant lane remained strong throughout 2002 and were particularly strong during the fourth quarter 

  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2002 compared to 2001 ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2002 ocean freight rates from the far east the company’s largest trade lane fell throughout the year ocean freight volumes increased during the last half of 2002 despite a 10day disruption in service at the ports located on the west coast of the united states the aftermath of this disruption continued throughout the fourth quarter management believes that the company’s continued strong performance through this work disruption is a significant indication of both the strength of the company’s relationships with its vendors and the expertise of its staff during 2002 management continued to expand market share increase ocean tonnage and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers changes in the regulatory environment in the united states continued to create new opportunities for the company’s nvocc operations to provide 

  

 

services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers 

  

margins decreased 1 in 2002 as compared with 2001 because the company reduced rates to increase volumes in response to an environment of falling prices which were a result of the overcapacity situation that existed in the ocean markets the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level ecms an ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased 18 in 2002 compared to 2001 this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and to a lesser extent from north america to europe ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 21 and 14 respectively for 2002 compared with 2001 

  

customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 9 in 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program 

  

salaries and related costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues 

  

other operating expenses increased in 2002 as compared with 2001 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant in 2002 as compared with 2001 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  during the fourth quarter of 2002 the company evaluated the recoverability of certain other assets and determined that an impairment had occurred accordingly a 35 million loss was recorded as an operating expense 

  

other income net decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001 due to much lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2002 interest income decreased by 29 million the decrease in interest income during the year ended december 31 2002 was offset by a 15 million gain on the sale of the company’s former dublin ireland facility 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2002 was 365 down from the 369 rate experienced in 2001 the 4 decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the company 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the 

  

 

us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2003 2002 and 2001 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2003 and 2002 were 588000 and 70000 respectively net foreign currency losses realized during 2001 were 366000 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services in light of the customerdriven trend to provide customer rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

sources of growth 

  

historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

office additions 

  

the company opened 3 startup offices and one office through an acquisition during 2003 the office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk 

  

   

during 2003 the company closed its luton england office and consolidated those operations with the operations of its london england office 

  

internal growth 

  

management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was approximately 114 million as compared with 116 million for 2002 this 2 million decrease is principally due to increased accounts receivable offset by increased net earnings and increased accounts payable accrued expenses and taxes payable increased accounts receivable is primarily due to slower collections on certain large technology accounts required to meet current market conditions increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a result of the company’s attempts to manage cash flows by matching the timing of cash outflows for payments to vendors with cash inflows from collections of customer billings 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity 

  

 

associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash in the past the company has utilized shortterm borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows these shortterm 

borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings during 2003 shortterm borrowings were not required in the united states despite the intense cash flow pressures in this market due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity 

  

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the bureau of customs and border protection these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 26 million as compared with 113 million during the same period of 2002 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures as a nonasset based provider of integrated logistics services the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie airplanes ships trucks etc however the company does have need on occasion to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight the company routinely invests in technology office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 

for the year ended december 31 2003 the company made capital expenditures of 21 million as compared with 81 million for the same period in 2002 capital expenditures in 2002 included 59 million for acquisitions of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in new jersey and the united kingdom other capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment cash of 313 million was paid into escrow during 2002 to acquire an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport the transaction closed on january 7 2003 the company currently expects to spend approximately 33 million for normal capital expenditures in 2004 in addition to property and equipment normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements warehouse equipment computer hardware and furniture and fixtures the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2004 with cash 

  

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 18 million as compared with 13 million for the same period in 2002 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market the differences between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares in 2001 the company repurchased 2000000 shares at an average price of 2256 per share under a discretionary plan authorized by the board of directors in november 2001 the board of directors voted to allow the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100000000 shares of common stock no repurchases were made under this plan in 2003 and 2002 during 2003 and 2002 the net use of cash in financing activities was primarily for the payment of dividends of 16 per share and 12 per share respectively 

  

at december 31 2003 working capital was 370 million including cash and shortterm investments of 296 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2003 while the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment the company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations 

  

the company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured bank lines of credit at december 31 2003 the us facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit totaled 149 million in addition the company maintains bank facilities with uk banks for 214 million at december 31 2003 the company was directly liable for 02 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional 519 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations the guarantees relate to obligations of the company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers primarily airlines and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and valueaddedtax vat taxation the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 

  

 

at december 31 2003 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

  

   

the company enters into shortterm agreements with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease historically the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2003 will be fulfilled during 2004 in the company’s ordinary course of business 

  

   

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2003 the company had repurchased and retired 5815182 shares of common stock at an average price of 1457 per share over the period from 1994 through 2003 during 2003 565374 shares were repurchased at an average price of 3556 per share

  

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 

  

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2003 cash and cash equivalent balances of 1322 million were held by the company’s nonus subsidiaries of which 449 million was held in banks in the united states during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company provided full us taxation on approximately 419 million of foreign earnings accumulated through december 31 1992 for which us income taxes had not previously been provided resulting in additional tax expense of 95 million income taxes had not previously been provided on these earnings as a result of the company’s previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred the company’s decision to provide us taxes on all unremitted foreign earnings was made based upon the desire to be able to deploy capital globally without concern for the impact of associated us tax obligations that might be incurred as a result of the repatriation of these earnings 

  

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation nor has the company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the company’s margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2003 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of securities and exchange commission sec regulation sk 

  

 




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2003 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 129 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 105 million 

  

the company has approximately 7 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely around the world any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2003 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2003 and 2002 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2003 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2959 million and shortterm borrowings of 02 million all subject to variable shortterm interest rates a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would have an insignificant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2002 and 2003

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the far east to the united states and related customs brokerage and import services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 42 42 and 41 percent of the company’s 2002 2001 and 2000 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated 

  

 

shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from nonexclusive agents for airfreight shipments 

  

customs brokerage and import services 

  

customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 34 35 and 38 percent of the company’s 2002 2001 and 2000 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing inland transportation inventory management cargo insurance and product distribution 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business required the company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service 

  

during 1996 the company established a subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc to respond to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the us customs service in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

  

there is currently a noticeable trend prompted by customer demand to quote rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 24 23 and 21 percent of the company’s 2002 2001 and 2000 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the far east to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits less than container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

  

 

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

employees 

  

at january 31 2003 the company employed approximately 8000 people 2800 in the united states and 500 in the balance of north america 300 in south america 1300 in europe 2200 in the far east  australasia 700 in the nearmiddle east and 200 in africa approximately 1000 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 5000 in operations and 2000 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the department of transportation “dot” as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

  

the company is licensed as a customs broker by the customs service of the department of the treasury in each us customs district in which it does business all us customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the customs service in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

  

 

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the us the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

  

the company does not believe that current us and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority usowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

  

cargo liability 

  

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 907 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

  

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates   

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in this 10k 

  

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex challenges in accounting for operations revenue recognition is considered the critical accounting policy due to the complexity of arranging and managing global logistics and supplychain management transactions 

 

revenue recognition   the company derives its revenues from three principal sources airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services and these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements

  

as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed “net revenue” or “yield” by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 

  

airfreight revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges 

  

based upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues an hawb or an hobl are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time 

  

revenues realized in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue an hawb or an hobl include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed these revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 

  

customs brokerage and import services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices revenues related to customs brokerage and import services are recognized upon completion of the services 

  

arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company may perform multiple services these services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service 

  

typically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as “doortodoor service” this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the company’s branches are independent profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate are done in an objective manner on a fair value basis in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

  

  

while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings 

  

•   accounts receivable valuation 

•   the useful lives of longterm assets 

•   the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides and 

•   establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has self insured 

  

in addition certain undistributed earnings of the company’s subsidiaries accumulated through december 31 1992 would under most circumstances be subject to some additional united states income tax if distributed to the company the company has not provided 

  

 

for this additional income tax because the company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 under the new rules purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of the statements intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002 application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 142 did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements the company performed the required initial impairment test of goodwill as of january 1 2002 and determined there was no impact on the consolidated earnings and financial position of the company at that time for the year ended december 31 2002 the company performed the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred 

  

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or development andor normal use of the asset the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 143 beginning in the first quarter of 2003 management does not anticipate that adoption of sfas no 143 will result in a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

in august 2001 sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” was issued which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets while this standard supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that standard sfas no 144 also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations – reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” for the disposal of a segment of a business the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 144 beginning in the first quarter of 2002 adoption of sfas no 144 had no impact on the consolidated earnings and financial position of the company 

  

in november 2001 the fasb staff issued topic d103 subsequently recharacterized as eitf 0114 “income statement characterization of reimbursements received for ‘out of pocket’ expenses incurred” this staff announcement clarified certain provisions of eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” and among other things established when reimbursements are required to be shown gross as opposed to net eitf 0114 also directed that the new rules should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december 15 2001 the clarifying rules now require the company to henceforth report certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross rather than net basis the company has reclassified amounts in the 2001 and 2000 presentations to conform with the current presentation 

  

 

the following schedule shows the financial statement impact of the adoption by comparing the net amounts in the report on form 10k filed on or about march 29 2002 with the gross amounts reported in this current 10k there is no impact on net revenue nor is there any impact on operating income or net earnings as a result of this change 

  

   

in june 2002 sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” was issued which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 146 beginning in the first quarter of 2003 management does not anticipate that adoption of sfas no 146 will result in a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” which clarifies disclosure and recognitionmeasurement requirements related to certain guarantees the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december 15 2002 and the recognitionmeasurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the provisions of fin 45 require the company to value and record the liability for any indirect or direct guarantees of the indebtedness of others entered into after december 31 2002 the company does not expect compliance with fin 45 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas no 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 as the company did not make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in 2002 the adoption of sfas no 148 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations the company has adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 148 in its financial reports for the year ended december 31 2002 and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for its financial reports beginning with the quarter ending march 31 2003 

  

 

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2002 2001 and 2000 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

2002 compared with 2001 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2002 increased 12 compared with 2001 primarily due to increased airfreight tonnages handled in 2002 as compared with 2001 airfreight margins decreased approximately 2 during 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of rate increases initiated by air carriers during the third and fourth quarters in response to excess air cargo demands associated with the west coast port disruptions efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues decreased 2 in 2002 compared to 2001 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 22 and 12 respectively for 2002 compared with 2001 airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes the company’s most dominant lane remained strong throughout 2002 and were particularly strong during the fourth quarter 

  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2002 compared to 2001 ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2002 ocean freight rates from the far east the company’s largest trade lane fell throughout the year ocean freight volumes increased during the last half of 2002 despite a 10day disruption in service at the ports located on the west coast of the united states the aftermath of this disruption continued throughout the fourth quarter management believes that the company’s continued strong performance through this work disruption is a significant indication of both the strength of the company’s relationships with its vendors and the expertise of its staff during 2002 management continued to expand market share increase ocean tonnage and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers changes in the regulatory environment in the united states continued to create new opportunities for the company’s nvocc operations to provide services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers 

  

 

margins decreased 1 in 2002 as compared with 2001 because the company reduced rates to increase volumes in response to an environment of falling prices which were a result of the overcapacity situation that existed in the ocean markets the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level expeditors cargo management systems ecms a pcbased ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased 18 in 2002 compared to 2001 this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and to a lesser extent from north america to europe ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 21 and 14 respectively for 2002 compared with 2001 

  

customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 9 in 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program 

  

salaries and related costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2002 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

other operating expenses increased in 2002 as compared with 2001 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant in 2002 as compared with 2001 management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  during the fourth quarter of 2002 the company evaluated the recoverability of certain other assets and determined that an impairment had occurred accordingly a 35 million loss was recorded as an operating expense 

  

other income net decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001 due to much lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and shortterm investments during 2002 interest income decreased by 29 million the decrease in interest income during the year ended december 31 2002 was offset by a 15 million gain on the sale of the company’s former dublin ireland facility 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2002 was 368 down marginally from the 37 rate experienced in the prior year the 2 decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the company 

  

2001 compared with 2000 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13 compared with 2000 primarily due to the company’s ability to expand airfreight margins despite the lower airfreight tonnages experienced in 2001 compared with 2000 airfreight margins expanded approximately 5 during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9 drop in worldwide airfreight tonnage in 2001 efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 4 in 2001 compared to 2000 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 24 and 5 respectively for 2001 compared with 2000 airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes the company’s most dominant lane remained strong throughout 2001 

  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21 in 2001 compared to 2000 ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the far east the company’s largest trade lane increased in the last half of the year during 2001 management continued to expand market share increase ocean tonnage and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers changes in the regulatory environment in the united states created new opportunities for the company’s nvocc operations to provide services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers 

  

margins increased 3 in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the company’s ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level ecms continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased 10 in 2001 compared to 2000 this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and to a lesser extent from north america to europe ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 

  

 

23 and 30 respectively for 2001 compared with 2000 

  

customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3 in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of 1 the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service 2 consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program and 3 the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers distribution services accounted for nearly 36 of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001 compared with 2000 

  

salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs increased 1 as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program

other income net increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and shortterm investments in 2001 management attributes higher cash balances in large part to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37 down marginally from the 377 rate experienced in the prior year the 7 decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the company 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move 

  

 

money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2002 2001 and 2000 was insignificant net foreign currency gains realized in 2002 were 70000 net foreign currency losses realized during 2001 were 366000 net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 were 309000 

  

the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services in light of the customerdriven trend to provide customer rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

on january 1 1999 eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union later joined by greece in january 2001 established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies “legacy currencies” and a new common currency  the euro the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries beginning in january 2002 new eurodenominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation the company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate eurodenominated transactions the conversion costs were not material the company is unable to predict the resulting impact if any on the company’s consolidated financial statements of the change to one common currency within the european union the company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion 

  

sources of growth 

  

historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

office additions 

  

the company did not open any offices during 2002 

  

internal growth 

  

management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was approximately 116 million as compared with 168 million for 2001 this 52 million decrease is principally due increased accounts receivable offset by increased net earnings and increased accounts payable accrued expenses and taxes payable 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash in the past the company has utilized shortterm borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows these shortterm 

  

 

borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings during 2002 shortterm borrowings were not required in the united states the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity 

  

as a customs broker the company makes significant 510 business day cash advances for its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to us customs these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 113 million as compared with 53 million during the same period of 2001 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2002 the company made capital expenditures of 81 million as compared with 37 million for the same period in 2001 capital expenditures in 2002 included 59 million for acquisitions of real estate and officewarehouse facilities in new jersey and the united kingdom capital expenditures in 2001 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment cash of 313 million was paid into escrow during 2002 to acquire an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport the transaction closed on january 7 2003 

  

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 13 million as compared with cash used in financing activities of 58 million for the same period in 2001 in 2002 the company paid down 04 million on shortterm debt as compared with 3 million for the same period of 2001 the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market the differences between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2000 represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares during the third quarter of 2001 the board of directors authorized management to repurchase 2000000 shares of the company’s common stock the difference between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for the year ended december 31 2001 is primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan authorized by the board of directors in september 2001 the repurchase of all 2000000 shares was completed on october 11 2001 at an average price of 2256 per share in november 2001 the board of directors expanded the company’s discretionary stock repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2002 no further shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan 

  

at december 31 2002 working capital was 249 million including cash and shortterm investments of 212 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2002 while the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment the company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations excluding the acquisition of the office and warehouse facility near the san francisco california international airport described earlier the company currently expects to spend approximately 35 million for normal capital expenditures in addition to property and equipment normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements warehouse equipment computer hardware and furniture and fixtures the company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2003 with cash 

  

the company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured bank lines of credit during the third quarter of 2002 the company entered into an unsecured line of credit agreement with a us financial institution at december 31 2002 the us facility totaled 50 million and the international bank lines of credit totaled 103 million in addition the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for 81 million at december 31 2002 the company was directly liable for 13 million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional 391 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations 

  

 

at december 31 2002 the company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows 

  

   

the company has a nondiscretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises as of december 31 2002 the company had repurchased and retired 5257703 shares of common stock at an average price of 1234 per share over the period from 1994 through 2002 

  

the company also has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which it retired 2000000 shares of common stock as of october 11 2001 at an average price of 2256 per share in november 2001 this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100000000 shares of common stock as of december 31 2002 no further shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan 

  

management believes that the company’s current cash position bank financing arrangements and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 

  

in some cases the company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2002 cash and cash equivalent balances of 1214 million were held by the company’s nonus subsidiaries of which 471 million was held in banks in the united states in addition certain undistributed earnings of the company’s subsidiaries accumulated through december 31 1992 would under most circumstances be subject to some additional united states income tax if distributed to the company such undistributed earnings are approximately 419 million and the additional federal and state taxes payable in a hypothetical distribution of such accumulated earnings would approximate 101 million the company has not provided for this additional tax because the company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred 

  

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation nor has the company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the company’s margins however as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 

  

 

the forwardlooking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include but are not limited to risks associated with foreign operations elimination of intercompany transactions matching of expenses with the associated revenue seasonality shifts in consumer demand the effect that the implementation of the euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the european union might have on the global economy and the company’s international and domestic customers other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company’s public reports 

  




 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2002 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 127 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 104 million 

  

the company has approximately 9 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely around the world any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2002 was insignificant the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2002 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2119 million and shortterm borrowings of 13 million all subject to variable shortterm interest rates a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would have an insignificant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2001 and 2002

 item 1—business 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services the company offers its customers a seamless international network supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods the company’s services include the consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight in each us office and in many overseas offices the company acts as a customs broker the company also provides additional services including distribution management vendor consolidation cargo insurance purchase order management and customized logistics information the company does not compete for domestic freight overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships 

  

the company including its majority owned subsidiaries operates full service offices • in the cities identified below full service offices have also been established in locations where the company maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock  in other cities the company contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has established over 120 such relationships worldwide locations where company employees perform sales and customer service functions are identified below as international service centers  in each case the opening date for the full service office or international service center is set forth in parenthesis 

  

   

 

   

 

the company was incorporated in the state of washington in may 1979 its executive offices are located at 1015 third avenue 12 th floor seattle washington and its telephone number is 206 6743400 

  

for information concerning the amount of revenues net revenues operating income identifiable assets capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

beginning in 1981 the company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the far east to the united states and related customs brokerage and import services in the mid1980’s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or establishing joint ventures with existing agents or others within the industry 

  

airfreight services 

  

airfreight services accounted for approximately 42 41 and 41 percent of the company’s 2001 2000 and 1999 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses “net revenues” respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as an agent or consolidator the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 

  

in its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 

  

the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3500 to 4500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or both 

  

the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 

  

the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 

  

the company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 

  

 

the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling and frequency of service may affect its business 

  

the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from nonexclusive agents for airfreight shipments 

  

customs brokerage and import services 

  

customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 35 38 and 39 percent of the company’s 2001 2000 and 1999 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing inland transportation inventory manipulation and management cargo insurance and product distribution 

  

the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 

  

the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business required the company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service 

  

during 1996 the company established a subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc to respond to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the us customs service in response to the 1993 customs modernization act fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 

  

there is currently a noticeable trend prompted by customer demand to quote rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

ocean freight and ocean services 

  

ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23 21 and 20 percent of the company’s 2001 2000 and 1999 consolidated net revenues respectively the company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company operates expeditors international ocean “eio” a nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the far east to the united states eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio solicits less than container load “lcl” freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 

  

expeditors cargo management systems “ecms” supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers as an ocean consolidator ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers the company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 

  

 

marketing and customers 

  

the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 

  

the company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 

  

the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 

  

the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computer components other electronic equipment housewares sporting goods machine parts and toys comprise a significant percentage of the company’s business typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers manufacturers and catalogue stores historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company’s revenues 

  

competition 

  

the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multiservice networks the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry recently larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange “edi” and online freight tracing and tracking applications the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the company’s systems freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 

  

management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company accordingly the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 

  

developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 

  

  

 

the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference many of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 

  

in addition the company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

seasonality 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

environmental 

  

in the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 

  

 

employees 

  

at february 28 2002 the company employed approximately 7590 people 2776 in the united states and 458 in the balance of north america 255 in south america 1296 in europe 1949 in the far east  australasia 702 in the nearmiddle east and 154 in africa approximately 944 of the company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service 4748 in operations and 1898 in finance and administration the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

  

in order to retain the services of highly qualified experienced and motivated employees the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

regulation 

  

with respect to the company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the department of transportation “dot” as an indirect air carrier the company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association “iata” iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 

  

the company is licensed as a customs broker by the customs service of the department of the treasury in each us customs district in which it does business all us customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the customs service in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 

  

the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission “fmc” the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the 

  

 

fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the us the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 

  

the company does not believe that current us and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority usowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity in such cases consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 

  

cargo liability 

  

when acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 907 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 

  

when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability 

  

when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services the company will assume additional liability 

  

the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

expeditors international of washington inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions the company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 

  

international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company’s business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade the company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 

  

the company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in space allotments available from carriers governmental deregulation efforts “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company’s business in unpredictable ways 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including climate national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company’s international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periods 

  

a significant portion of the company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the company’s revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the company’s control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company’s stock 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates   

management believes that the nature of the company’s business is such that there are few if any complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation the useful lives of longterm assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides—areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company’s statement of earnings management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company’s transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company 

  

  

  

believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company’s principal services and the company’s expenses for 2001 2000 and 1999 expressed as percentages of net revenues with respect to the company’s services other than freight consolidation net revenues are identical to revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 

  

   

  

2001 compared with 2000 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13 compared with 2000 primarily due to the company’s ability to expand airfreight margins despite the lower airfreight tonnages experienced in 2001 compared with 2000 airfreight margins expanded approximately 5 during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9 drop in worldwide airfreight tonnage in 2001 efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 4 in 2001 compared to 2000 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 24 and 5 respectively for 2001 compared with 2000 airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes the company’s most dominant lane remained strong throughout 2001 

  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21 in 2001 compared to 2000 ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the far east the company’s largest trade lane increased in the last half of the year during 2001 management continued to expand market share increase ocean tonnage and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers changes in the regulatory environment in the united states created new opportunities for the company’s nvocc operations to provide services to customers who had 

  

 

previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers margins increased 3 in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the company’s ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level expeditors cargo management systems ecms a pcbased ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service continued to be instrumental in attracting new business the company’s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased 10 in 2001 compared to 2000 this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and to a lesser extent from north america to europe ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 23 and 30 respectively for 2001 compared with 2000 

  

customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3 in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of 1 the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service 2 consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program and 3 the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers distribution services accounted for nearly 36 of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001 compared with 2000 

  

salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of 1 the company’s increased hiring of sales operations and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and 2 increased compensation levels salaries and related costs increased 1 as a percentage of net revenues the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits management believes that the growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the company’s compensation program 

  

other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as rent expense communications expense quality and training expenses and other costs expanded to accommodate the company’s growing operations other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2 in 2001 as compared with 2000 management believes that this decrease was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives  

  

other income net increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and shortterm investments in 2001 management attributes higher cash balances in large part to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives 

  

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37 down marginally from the 377 rate experienced in the prior year the 7 decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the company 

  

2000 compared with 1999 

  

airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23 compared with 1999 primarily due to 1 increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the company from the far east to north america and europe 2 increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers and 3 increased export airfreight shipments and tonnages from north america and europe airfreight margins expanded approximately 2 during 2000 as compared with 1999 higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers the company’s north american export airfreight net revenues increased 21 in 2000 compared to 1999 airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased 31 and 9 respectively for 2000 compared with 1999 airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes the company’s most dominant lane remained strong throughout 2000 

  

ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 32 in 2000 compared to 1999 ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the far east the company’s largest trade lane increased in the last half of the year during 2000 management continued to expand market share increase ocean tonnage and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers changes in the regulatory environment in the united states created new opportunities for the company’s nvocc operations to provide services to customers who had

customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 21 in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of 1 the company’s growing reputation for providing high quality service 2 consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program and 3 the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers distribution services accounted for nearly 22 of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000 compared with 1999

the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 377 

  

currency and other risk factors 

  

international airocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry however the company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks regional and local brokerforwarders remain a competitive force 

  

historically the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 

  

developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network as a result there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to mediumterm 

  

  

the nature of the company’s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to avoid shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2001 2000 and 1999 was insignificant net foreign currency losses realized in 2001 were 366000 net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were 309000 and 196000 respectively the current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of intercompany obligations with the company’s subsidiaries in brazil taiwan indonesia and turkey 

  

the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services in light of the customerdriven trend to provide customer rates on a doortodoor basis management foresees the potential in the medium to longterm for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be deemphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 

  

on january 1 1999 eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union later joined by greece in january 2001 established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies “legacy currencies” and a new common currency  the euro the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries beginning in january 2002 new eurodenominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation the company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate eurodenominated transactions the conversion costs were not material due to numerous uncertainties the company is evaluating the effects one common european currency will have on pricing the company is unable to predict the resulting impact if any on the company’s consolidated financial statements the company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion 

  

sources of growth 

  

historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction 

  

 

office additions 

  

the company opened 7 startup offices and one office through an acquisition during 2001 the office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk 

  

   

internal growth 

  

management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company’s internally generated growth this “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company’s operating results for at least one full year the table below presents “same store” comparisons on a yearoveryear basis for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 

  

same store comparisons for the years ended december 31 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2001 was approximately 168 million as compared with 154 million for 2000 this 14 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings decreased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable accrued expenses and taxes payable 

  

the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash in the past the company has utilized shortterm borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows these shortterm borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings during 2001 shortterm borrowings were not required in the united states the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity 

  

as a customs broker the company can make significant 510 business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of creditworthy customers cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable as a result of these “pass through” billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 

  

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2001 was 53 million as compared with 29 million during the same period of 2000 the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2001 the company made capital expenditures of 37 million as compared with 26 million 

  

 

for the same period in 2000 capital expenditures in 2001 and in 2000 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment

impact of inflation 

  

to date the company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation nor has the company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the company’s margins however as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the company’s exposure to these risks is presented below 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions this brings a market risk to the company’s earnings 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the company’s functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2001 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 98 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 8 million 

  

the company has approximately 10 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company’s ability to move money freely around the world any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2001 was insignificant the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days 

  

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2001 the company had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2187 million and shortterm borrowings of 17 million all subject to variable shortterm interest rates a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 would have an insignificant impact on the company’s earnings 

  

in management’s opinion there has been no material change in the company’s market risk exposure between 2000 and 2001
