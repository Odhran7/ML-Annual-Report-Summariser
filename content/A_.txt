  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental regulatory affairs and human capital management include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarters orders therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health to address any potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our research and development manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws we also maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

climate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense 

in addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations we are also committed to sustainability and environmental protection in 2021 we announced our commitment to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050 for more information on our approach to sustainability management refer to our 2021 esg report which is available on our website 

regulatory affairs 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda the us department of health and human services the centers for medicare and medicaid services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil or criminal penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions suspension or revocation of our license to operate increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products in europe the european union has started to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new 

  

regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance activities the new eu ivdr requirements became effective starting in may 2022

 item 1a risk factors 

business and strategic risks 

t he covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to certain elements of our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations sales and delivery and supply chains many countries including the united states implemented measures such as quarantine shelterinplace curfew travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products moreover these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site for example in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 the outbreak of covid19 in china led to a mandated shutdown of our facilities in shanghai which negatively impacted our business and results and impacted our supply chain the covid19 pandemic also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products while many of our customers have returned to work and economic activity has ramped up we are unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic the efficacy and distribution of vaccines containment measures and additional waves of infection as covid19 conditions improved there have been increases in demand for certain of our products which posed challenges to our supply chain if there are supply shortages or delays and we are not able to meet increasing product demand our results would be adversely affected 

additionally the covid19 pandemic caused significant volatility in us and international markets the impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of uncertainty in the global financial markets high inflation and extended economic downturn which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results and financial condition even after local conditions improve there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

as covid19 conditions have improved the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth inflationary pressures instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our products delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations 

• increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increased price pressure for our products and services and 

• greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs and predict future needs 

• innovate and develop new technologies services and applications 

• appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

• price our products competitively 

• anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and 

• control product quality in our manufacturing process 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

  

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2022 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• ongoing instability or changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic the ukrainerussia conflict and political and trade uncertainties in the greater china region 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships as well as new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade 

  

barriers 

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs enacted by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods 

• negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations including those related to tax and importexport 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil terrorism and war and 

• impact of public health crises including pandemics and epidemics such as covid19 on the global economy 

we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change further additional tariffs the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia if economical political health or other conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances 

  

consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business model business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition as a global organization we are subject to data 

  

privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business global privacy laws including the eus general data protection regulation gdpr” brazil’s lei geral de protecao de dados the california consumer privacy act and china’s personal information protection law and data security law apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce the global proliferation of privacy laws with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected many such laws impose significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the gdpr or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations such laws demand that we implement test and monitor an effective compliance program violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda the us department of health and human services the centers for medicare  medicaid services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and servicerelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution in addition we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities if we or any of our suppliers distributors or customers fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil or criminal penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions suspension or revocation of our license to operate increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services for example the eu has started to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket 

  

surveillance activities the new eu ivdr requirements became effective starting in may 2022 failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by the epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing storing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us federal state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and siemens healthineers formerly varian medical systems inc further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental 

  

contamination at material levels is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs 

our current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability further in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities we cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us our customers or our suppliers failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions restrictions on our operations and reputational damage if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

  

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and nyse as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

operational risks 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have consolidated and may further consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism public health crises increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events or other climatechange related risks including resource scarcity rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather 

  

conditions for example in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 the outbreak of covid19 in china led to mandated shutdown of our facilities in shanghai which adversely impacted our business and results and impacted our supply chain in addition several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity in addition our facilities in california are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought and wildfires if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events for example in december 2020 it was widely reported that solarwinds an information technology company was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients we identified an impacted solarwinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents while we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

financial and tax risks 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and 

  

regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we are party to a 135 billion fiveyear unsecured credit facility that will expire on march 13 2024 and a 600 million term loan facility that matures on april 15 2025 furthermore we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to 500 million as of october 31 2022 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the incremental facilities on june 18 2021 we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to 135 billion as of october 31 2022  we had borrowings of 35 million outstanding under our us commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 354 percent we also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 21 billion in senior unsecured notes and 600 million outstanding under the term loan facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

our credit facility and our term loan facility each imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1053 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available under different economic circumstances any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition

covid19 pandemic 

both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the us and international markets in fiscal 2022 many businesses and countries including the us continued applying preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus 

in the latter part of our second quarter we had to shut down our primary gas chromatography production facility and logistics center in shanghai in compliance with lockdown measures related to covid19 we successfully managed the unplanned shutdown of our facility and fully recognized the revenue that was delayed from our second quarter within fiscal year 2022 

while conditions related to the covid19 pandemic have improved in 2022 compared to 2021 the pandemic continues to be dynamic and nearterm challenges across the economy remain the ongoing effects of covid19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the severity duration and resurgence of the outbreak new variants and the contagiousness of these new variants the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines and therapies government and community responses including additional lockdowns the pace and strength of the economic recovery supply chain pressures delivery and installation delays due to variable access to customer sites among others we will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business results 

russiaukraine conflict 

in response to the ongoing conflict in ukraine at the beginning of march we suspended sales prohibited by sanctions halted the shipment of products to russia with the exception of diagnostics and healthcare products and limited our incountry service to those diagnostics and healthcare customers subsequently effective may 23 2022 we ceased major operations within russia and as a result we recorded an immaterial expense associated with the shutdown of operations for the three months ended april 30 2022 for the year ended october 31 2022 and 2021 sales derived from customers based in russia represented an immaterial percentage of our total revenue 

term loan facility

looking forward we remain focused on improving our customers’ experience differentiating product solutions and productivity we expect to face continued inflationary and logistical pressures such as longer lead times and limited sources of supply in the near term which we will continue to mitigate through targeted pricing and various sourcing strategies while we anticipate an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal year 2023 we remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in all of our key end markets in fiscal year 2023

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition  we enter into contracts to sell products services or combinations of products and services products may include hardware or software and services may include onetime service events or services performed over time 

we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under accounting standard codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers “asc 606’’ revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services the transaction price for equipment consumables and most software licenses control transfers to the customer at a point in time we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer for products that transfer control over time revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created the asset has no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded 

service revenue includes extended warranty customer and software support including software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the service period as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

we have sales from standalone software these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis 

  

our multipleelement arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other startup services andor software andor support or services hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 

for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations 

a portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 842 leases asc 842 beginning in 2020 and asc 840 leases asc 840 for prior periods each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a salestype finance lease using the current lease classification guidance in a lease arrangement that is a multipleelement arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard asc 842 whereas the revenue associated with the consumables the nonlease component is recognized in accordance with the asc 606 revenue standard 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2022 and 2021 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2022 discount rates for the us pension and retiree medical plans increased compared to the previous year due to the increase in the corporate bond rates for 2022 and 2021 the discount rates for nonus plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2022 increased compared to the previous year if we had changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would have been approximately 3 million on us pension expense and 16 million on nonus pension expense for the year ended october 31 2022 lower discount rates usually increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates usually decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses 

in the us target asset allocations for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of october 31 2022 our deferred profitsharing plan 

  

target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments approximately 1 percent of the retirement and postretirement plans consists of limited partnerships outside the us our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities from 30 percent to 80 percent to fixed income investments from zero to 25 percent to real estate and from zero to 55 percent to annuity contracts depending on the plan all plans assets are broadly diversified due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31 2022 may differ from the target allocation our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation 

equity securities include exchangetraded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries government securities mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities derivative instruments and other the annuity contract is an insurance buyin contract issued by a thirdparty insurance company for a portion of benefit obligations of listed pensioners under the uk defined benefit plan and is funded with existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we had changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would have been 6 million on us pension expense and 10 million on nonus pension expense for the year ended october 31 2022 the total periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 2 million benefit in 2022 24 million expense in 2021 and 22 million expense in 2020 these costs included a loss on settlement of 4 million 1 million and 4 million for the years ended october 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets we assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized a goodwill impairment loss if any is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value including goodwill exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

in fiscal year 2022 we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of november 1 2021 due to the change in our segment structure as of november 1 2021 there was no impairment of goodwill we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2022 our annual impairment test date based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2022 2021 and 2020 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions specifically our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and inprocess research and development iprd 

  

acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates discount rates and customer attrition rates our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use actual results could differ materially from these estimates iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2022 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair values of these indefinitelived intangible assets are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets is indicated during the year ended october 31 2022 and 2021 there were no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets during the year ended october 31 2020 we recorded an impairment of inprocess research and development of 90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2022 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points when compared to 2020 when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling thirteenmonth period we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

income taxes 



for 2022 our income tax expense was 250 million with an effective tax rate of 166 percent for the year ended october 31 2022 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of 46 million related to foreignderived intangible income 

for 2021 our income tax expense was 150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent for the year ended october 31 2021 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of 93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations the income taxes for the year ended october 31 2021 also include the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 29 million 

for 2020 our income tax expense was 123 million with an effective tax rate of 146 percent for the year ended october 31 2020 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates 

we have negotiated a tax holiday in singapore the tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in december 2018 the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 as a result of the incentive the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by 53 million 35 million and 71 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share diluted was approximately 018 011 and 023 in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

  

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities and equity denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 56 percent of our revenue in 2022 53 percent of our revenue in 2021 and 52 percent of our revenue in 2020 was generated in us dollars the overall unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us 

dollar has decreased revenue by approximately 4 percentage points in the year ended october 31 2022 we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2022 and 2021 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2022 and 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

agilent order fulfillment organizations 

our order fulfillment and supply chain organization “ofs” focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses ofs provides resources for manufacturing engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses in general ofs employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses 

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental regulatory affairs and human capital management include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarters orders therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health to address any potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws we also maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

climate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense 

in addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations we are also committed to sustainability and environmental protection in 2021 we announced our commitment to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050 for more information on our approach to sustainability management refer to our annual corporate social responsibility report which is available on our website 

regulatory affairs 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda the us department of health and human services the centers for medicare and medicaid services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil or criminal penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions suspension or revocation of our license to operate increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products in europe the european union is going to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new 

  

regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance activities the new eu ivdr requirements become effective in may 2022 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

we are also subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results 

in addition as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business global privacy laws including the eus general data protection regulation gdpr” brazil’s lei geral de protecao de dados  and the california consumer privacy act apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce the global proliferation of privacy laws with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data with many such laws imposing significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the gdpr each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

business and strategic risks 

t he covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to certain elements of our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations sales and delivery and supply chains many countries including the united states implemented measures such as quarantine shelterinplace curfew travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products moreover these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site the covid19 pandemic also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products while many of our customers have returned to work and economic activity continues to ramp up we are unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic the efficacy and distribution of vaccines and containment measures as covid19 conditions improved there have been increases in demand for certain of our products which posed challenges to our supply chain if there are supply shortages or delays and we are not able to meet increasing product demand our results would be adversely affected 

additionally the covid19 pandemic caused significant volatility in us and international markets the impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of uncertainty in the global financial markets high inflation and extended economic downturn which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results and financial condition even after local conditions improve there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

to the extent covid19 conditions improve the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions such as our returntooffice plans may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

us president biden has issued an executive order requiring federal employees and covered contractors to be vaccinated against covid19 additionally on november 4 2021 the us department of labor’s occupational safety and health administration osha issued a covid19 vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or tested for covid19 on at least a weekly basis notwithstanding legal and timing uncertainties relating to these regulations we have implemented requirements regarding mandatory vaccines for us based covered employees subject to approved exemptions additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business while it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact the new regulations would have on us our suppliers and our customers the implementation of such government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees and result in labor disruptions further implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them 

  

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs and predict future needs 

• innovate and develop new technologies services and applications 

• appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

• price our products competitively 

• anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and 

• control product quality in our manufacturing process 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our products delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations 

• increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increased price pressure for our products and services and 

• greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio 

  

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue they will also have a negative impact by increasing our costs and expenses in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships as well as new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers 

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs enacted by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods 

  

• negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations including those related to tax and importexport 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil terrorism and war and 

• impact of public health crises including pandemics and epidemics such as covid19 on the global economy 

we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change further additional tariffs the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia if economical political health or other conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

  

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business model business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business global privacy laws including the eus general data protection regulation gdpr” brazil’s lei geral de protecao de dados and the california 

  

consumer privacy act apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce the global proliferation of privacy laws with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data with many such laws imposing significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the gdpr each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda the us department of health and human services the centers for medicare  medicaid services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and servicerelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution in addition we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities if we or any of our suppliers distributors or customers fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil or criminal penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions suspension or revocation of our license to operate increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services for example the eu is going to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance activities the new eu ivdr requirements become effective in may 2022 failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

  

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by the epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us federal state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and siemens healthineers formerly varian medical systems inc further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

  

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs 

our current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability further in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities we cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us our customers or our suppliers failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions restrictions on our operations and reputational damage if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and nyse as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making 

  

compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the sec which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

operational risks 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have consolidated and may further consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined 

  

above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism public health crises increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events or other climatechange related risks for example in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 the outbreak of covid19 in china led to an extension of the lunar new year holiday which adversely impacted our business and results reduced the number of selling days and otherwise impacted our supply chain in addition several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events for example in december 2020 it was widely reported that solarwinds an information technology company was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients we identified an impacted solarwinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents while we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

financial and tax risks 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we are party to a 135 billion fiveyear unsecured credit facility that will expire on march 13 2024 furthermore we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to 500 million as of october 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we had no borrowings under the incremental facilities on june 18 2021 we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to 135 billion as of october 31 2021  we had no borrowings outstanding under our us commercial paper program we also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 27 billion in senior unsecured notes we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

  

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1484 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition

overview and executive summary 

agilent technologies inc we agilent or the company incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is a global leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied chemical markets providing application focused solutions that include instruments software services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow 

covid19 pandemic 

both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the us and international markets during the year ended october 31 2021 many businesses and countries including the us continued applying preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations 

the health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us in response to the covid19 pandemic we took proactive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees customers partners and suppliers we enacted safety measures including social distancing protocols encouraging employees to work from home when possible suspending nonessential work travel implementing various access controls at our facilities frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities as covid19 conditions improved we began implementing a phased reopening process required our us employees to be fully vaccinated pursuant to federal state and local guidelines and continued to prioritize health and safety we expect to continue to implement appropriate safety measures until the covid19 pandemic is contained we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers currently most of our employees are still working from home when we determine it is safe for our employees to return to the office we will be moving towards a hybrid work model giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at our onsite locations 

the covid19 pandemic continues to be dynamic and nearterm challenges across the economy remain the ongoing effects of covid19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the severity duration and resurgence of the outbreak new variants the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines managing the different pace of returntooffice in different locations the pace and strength of the economic recovery and supply chain pressures among others we will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business results 

  

despite the economic challenges due to the covid19 pandemic we ended our fiscal year 2021 with revenue growth of 18 percent year over year this revenue growth was primarily noncovid related revenue and came from all of our segments key end markets and geographies revenue growth was also partly due to weakened sales in the prior year as the response to the early stages of the pandemic caused many of our customers to close or reduce operating capacity in fiscal year 2021 our overall business performance was strong which also resulted in significant expense increases from our variable pay and longterm performance planearnings per share ltppeps programs along with sales commission increases year over year which was partially offset by the continued cost savings actions which included reduction in travel and nonessential spending that we implemented last year 

acquisition 

on april 15 2021 we completed the acquisition of privatelyowned resolution bioscience inc a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of nextgeneration sequencingbased ngs precision oncology solutions for 561 million cash plus potential future contingent payments of up to 145 million upon the achievement of certain milestones which are based on certain revenue and technical targets resolution bioscience complements and expands our capabilities in ngsbased cancer diagnostics within our diagnostics and genomics segment and provides us with innovative technology to further serve the needs of the fastgrowing precision medicine market the fair value of the contingent consideration as of october 31 2021 was 89 million which included a decrease of 21 million from the estimated fair value as of the end of our third quarter 

2022 senior notes 

on january 21 2021 we redeemed 100 million of the 400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2022 senior notes due october 1 2022 on april 5 2021 we redeemed the remaining outstanding 300 million of our 2022 senior notes the total redemption price of approximately 417 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2022 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed during the year ended october 31 2021 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 17 million in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations in addition 1 million of accrued interest up to but not including the applicable redemption date was paid the makewhole premium less partial amortization of previously deferred interest rate swap gain together with the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount was recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition  on november 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 

we enter into contracts to sell products services or combinations of products and services products may include hardware or software and services may include onetime service events or services performed over time 

we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606 revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services the transaction price for equipment consumables and most software licenses control transfers to the customer at a point in time we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded 

service revenue includes extended warranty customer and software support including software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the service period as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

we have sales from standalone software these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis 

our multipleelement arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other startup services andor software andor support or services hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 

for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation standalone selling 

  

prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations 

a portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 842 leases asc 842 beginning in 2020 and asc 840 leases asc 840 for prior periods each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a salestype finance lease using the current lease classification guidance in a lease arrangement that is a multipleelement arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard asc 842 whereas the revenue associated with the consumables the nonlease component is recognized in accordance with the asc 606 revenue standard 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2021 and 2020 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2021 discount rates for the us retiree medical plans increased marginally compared to the previous year due to the increase in the corporate bond rates for 2021 and 2020 the discount rates for nonus plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2021 increased marginally compared to the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million in us pension expense and 18 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses 

in the us target asset allocations for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans were approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments as of october 31 2020 and were changed to approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of october 31 2021 our deferred profitsharing plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments approximately 1 percent of the retirement and postretirement plans consists of limited partnerships outside the us our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities from 38 percent to 85 percent to fixed income investments and from zero to 25 percent to real estate depending on the plan all plans assets are broadly diversified due to fluctuations in equity markets our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31 2021 and 2020 differ from the target allocation our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation 

equity securities include exchangetraded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries government securities mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities derivative instruments and other other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships 

  

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 5 million on us pension expense and 10 milion on nonus pension expense the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 24 million expense in 2021 22 million expense in 2020 and 10 million expense in 2019 the years ended october 31 2021 and 2020 included a loss on settlement of 1 million and 4 million respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets we assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized a goodwill impairment loss if any is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value including goodwill exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

in fiscal year 2021 we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2021 our annual impairment test date based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions specifically our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and inprocess research and development iprd acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates discount rates and customer attrition rates our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use actual results could differ materially from these estimates iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 

  

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2021 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets is indicated during the year ended october 31 2020 we recorded an impairment of inprocess research and development of 90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment during the year ended october 31 2021 and 2019 there were no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

  

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 1 percentage point when compared to 2019 when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue they will also have a negative impact by increasing our costs and expenses we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling thirteenmonth period we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

income taxes 



for 2021 our income tax expense was 150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent for the year ended october 31 2021 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of 93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations the income taxes for the year ended october 31 2021 also include the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 29 million 

for 2020 our income tax expense was 123 million with an effective tax rate of 146 percent for the year ended october 31 2020 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates 

for 2019 our income tax benefit was 152 million with an effective tax rate of 165 percent for the year ended october 31 2019 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of 299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in singapore 

  

we have negotiated a tax holiday in singapore the tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in december 2018 the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 as a result of the incentive the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by 35 million 71 million and 368 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share diluted was approximately 011 023 and 116 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively of the 116 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share diluted in 2019 094 of the benefit relates to onetime items from the extension of the company’s tax incentive in singapore 

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary

the change in the employee compensation and benefits liability was 112 million for year ended october 31 2021 compared to cash provided of 29 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2019 this was largely due to an increase in the vacation liability and variable and incentive pay liability we paid approximately 119 million in 2021 under our variable and incentive pay programs compared to 79 million in 2020 and 118 million in 2019 the decrease in the amount for variable and incentive pay programs paid in 2020 was primarily due to changes made for certain incentive pay programs which were paid annually versus semiannually as was done in 2019

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2021 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 83 million approximately 22 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 12 years 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate effective may 1 2016 until april 30 2022 we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent 4 percent or 5 percent of an employees annual eligible compensation due to the us retirement plan benefits being frozen 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2021 or october 31 2020 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our october 31 2021 balance sheet in millions 



other longterm liabilities as of october 31 2021 and october 31 2020 include 241 million and 323 million respectively related to longterm income tax liabilities of these amounts 117 million and 199 million related to uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2021 and october 31 2020 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement the remaining 124 million included in other longterm liabilities relates to the onetime transition tax payable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 53 percent of our revenue in 2021 52 percent of our revenue in 2020 and 51 percent of our revenue in 2019 were generated in us dollars the overall favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the weakness of the us dollar has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended october 31 2021 we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2021 and 2020 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental regulatory affairs and human capital management include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarters orders therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health to address any potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

regulatory affairs 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products in europe the european union is going to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance activities we will have until may 2022 to meet the new eu ivdr requirements 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

we are also subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anti 

  

competition violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results 

in addition as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business the eus general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

human capital management 

as of october 31 2020 we employed approximately 16400 persons of whom approximately 5600 were employed in the united states and approximately 10800 were employed outside of the united states we also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs 

we believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees we provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses opportunities for equity ownership development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes wellbeing across all aspects of their lives including health care retirement planning and paid time off as part of our promotion and retention efforts we also invest in ongoing leadership development through programs such as our emerging leader program our managing at agilent programs and our experienced managers’ accelerate program in addition we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors specific to our company that may affect future results 

t he covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations sales and delivery and supply chains many countries including the united states implemented measures such as quarantine shelterinplace curfew travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products moreover these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site if the covid19 pandemic continues or worsens we may again experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain of our businesses continuing travel restrictions prolonged quarantines or other government orders in response to the pandemic may significantly impact our ability to support our sites and service customers in those locations the covid19 pandemic has also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products if the pandemic continues or worsens our manufacturing facilities our distribution centers where inventory is managed and the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be significantly impacted accordingly covid19 has negatively affected our revenue growth in certain of our businesses it is uncertain how materially covid19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist worsen or reemerge over an extended period of time the extent and duration of these impacts are dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity continuing to ramp up the impact on our business also depends in part on the pace at which our customers resume noncovid19 related patient care and testing as well as the timing of when research performed by laboratories and other institutions returns to normal levels 

additionally the covid19 pandemic caused significant volatility and uncertainty in us and international markets a disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and increase the cost of doing so there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the related response or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows ultimately the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent covid19 conditions improve the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales 

  

research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs and predict future needs 

• innovate and develop new technologies services and applications 

• appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

• price our products competitively 

• anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and 

• control product quality in our manufacturing process 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our products delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations 

• increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increased price pressure for our products and services and 

• greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

  

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships such as the united kingdoms exit from the european union and the increased uncertainty around its implementation caused by covid19 as well as new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers 

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods 

• negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations including those related to tax and importexport 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil terrorism and war and 

• impact of public health crises including pandemics and epidemics such as covid19 on the global economy 

we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change further additional tariffs the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

  

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business model business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired 

  

businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition a s a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business the eus general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely 

  

affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product and servicerelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services for example the eu is going to enforce new requirements known as the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the european union these new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas including clinical requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance activities we will have until may 2022 to meet the new eu ivdr requirements failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by the epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us federal state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have consolidated and may further consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

  

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and varian medical systems inc further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability further in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual 

  

property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

the us tax cuts and job act the tax act significantly changed the taxation of us based multinational corporations our compliance with the tax act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions the implementation of the tax act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service irs as well as state tax authorities the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

  

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we are party to a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured credit facility that will expire on march 13 2024 as of october 31 2020 the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility on august 7 2019 we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which provided for a 500 million shortterm loan facility that was used in full to complete the acquisition of biotek and was repaid in full as of october 31 2020 on october 21 2019 we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to 500 million we had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of october 31 2020 on may 1 2020 we entered into a new 10 billion commercial paper program and as of october 31 2020 we had 75 million of commercial paper outstanding we also have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 23 billion in senior unsecured notes we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism public health crises increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events or other natural or manmade disasters for example in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 the outbreak of covid19 in china led to an extension of the lunar new year holiday which impacted our business and results reduced the number of selling days and otherwise impacted our supply chain as described above the covid19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations supply chain and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

  

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

general risks 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1441 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the sec which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so

overview and executive summary 

agilent technologies inc we agilent or the company incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is a global leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied chemical markets providing application focused solutions that include instruments software services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow 

covid19 pandemic 

both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the us and international markets many countries including the united states implemented measures such as quarantine shelterinplace curfew travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations at different times due to these measures we experienced unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products and delays in installations and services due to the inability to access customer sites primarily in the latter part of our second quarter 

as an essential business throughout the covid19 pandemic we have remained open with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees customers and community at every stage of the pandemic we have taken decisive and appropriate precautions including a mandatory work from home policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing distribution and certain laboratory environments as well as restrictions on all nonessential travel and visitors into our facilities at this time our factories continue to operate around the world in accordance with the guidance issued by local state and national government authorities our digital workplace strategy and strategic technology investments have enabled us to provide modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees to meet remote working needs as this situation has escalated we have taken and continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our global employee base we designed a multiphase returntooffice process for the safe return of our employees to our sites we developed and implemented rigorous returntooffice protocols to promote a safe work environment in all locations for employees who have been working onsite throughout the pandemic and for employees who will be returning in the future as well as for the safety of all customer and vendor interactions 

at this time the covid19 pandemic has not significantly impacted our manufacturing facilities or third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers we continue working with our customers and suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our delivery and supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts the majority of the markets we serve such as the pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical food environmental and diagnostics and clinical markets have continued to operate at various levels throughout the pandemic and we continue working closely with 

  

our customers to ensure their seamless operations from a customerfacing perspective we continue leveraging digital demand generation activities including virtual demonstrations across all regions remote instrument repairs virtual sales seminars online product training and rapid oneonone communications over emails phone and video conferencing 

despite the economic challenges due to the covid19 pandemic we ended fiscal year 2020 with revenue growth of 3 percent year over year with revenue growth from most of our key end markets in the latter part of the fiscal year our agilent crosslab business began to see an increase in revenue for our ondemand services and installation services due to the reopening of laboratories around the world especially in europe while we began to see elective medical procedures resume in the fourth quarter revenue from our diagnostics and genomics business continues to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic in our life sciences and applied markets business we saw an increase in demand for some of our products for use in the covid19 testing vaccine and therapeutic drug development we also benefited from our cost savings actions which included reduction in travel and nonessential spending 

the covid19 pandemic continues to be dynamic and nearterm challenges across the economy remain although we anticipate there will be vaccines distributed widely in the near future we expect continued volatility and unpredictability related to the impact of covid19 on our business results we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and we will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the adverse impacts on our business posed by the ongoing spread of covid19

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition  on november 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 

we enter into contracts to sell products services or combinations of products and services products may include hardware or software and services may include onetime service events or services performed over time 

  

we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606 revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services the transaction price for equipment consumables and most software licenses control transfers to the customer at a point in time we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded 

service revenue includes extended warranty customer and software support including software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the service period as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

we have sales from standalone software these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis 

our multipleelement arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other startup services andor software andor support or services hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 

for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations 

a portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 842 leases each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a salestype capital lease using the current lease classification guidance in a lease arrangement that is a multipleelement arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard asc 842 whereas the revenue associated with the consumables the nonlease component is recognized in accordance with the asc 606 revenue standard 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2020 and 2019 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2020 discount rates for the us plans decreased compared to the previous year due to the decrease in the corporate bond rates for 2020 and 2019 the discount rates for nonus plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2020 decreased marginally compared to the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million in us pension expense and 17 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses 

in the us target asset allocations for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments our deferred profitsharing plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments approximately 1 percent of the retirement and postretirement plans consists of limited partnerships outside the us our target asset allocation ranges from 24 percent to 60 percent to equities from 38 percent to 65 percent to fixed income investments and from zero to 25 percent to real estate depending on the plan all plans assets are broadly diversified due to fluctuations in equity markets our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31 2020 and 2019 differ from the target allocation our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation 

equity securities include exchangetraded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries government securities mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities derivative instruments and other other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us pension expense and 9 million on nonus pension expense the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 22 million expense in 2020 10 million expense in 2019 and 3 million benefit in 2018 the year ended october 31 2020 included a loss on settlement of 4 million the year ended october 31 2018 included a settlement gain of 5 million 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

  

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

in fiscal year 2020 we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2020 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions specifically our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and inprocess research and development iprd acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates discount rates and customer attrition rates our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use actual results could differ materially from these estimates iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets during 2018 we recorded an impairment charge of 21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2020 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets is indicated during fiscal year 2020 we recorded an impairment of inprocess research and development of 90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment during the year ended october 31 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent 

  

upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2019 when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue they will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling thirteenmonth period we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

costs and expenses 



total gross margin for the year ended october 31 2020 decreased 1 percentage point when compared to 2019 gross margin declined due to the impacts of pricing pressure higher intangible amortization expense higher wages net unfavorable currency impact and higher fixed costs related to the new manufacturing facility in frederick colorado partially offset by lower period and travel costs total gross margin for the year ended october 31 2019 was flat when compared to 2018 total gross margin reflects the impact of efficiency gains lower inventory charges and favorable currency impact on costs offset by higher wages and variable pay product mix higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets 

gross inventory charges were 28 million in 2020 19 million in 2019 and 26 million in 2018 sales of previously written down inventory were 7 million in 2020 6 million in 2019 and 8 million in 2018 

research and development expenses increased 22 percent for the year ended october 31 2020 when compared to 2019 research and development expenses increased primarily due to intangible and other asset impairments of 97 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program the increase is also due to higher wages and additional expenses related to our acquisition of biotek partially offset by lower discretionary expenditures including lower travel costs and favorable currency impact research and development expenses increased 5 percent for the year ended october 31 2019 when compared to 2018 research and development expenses increased due to increased program spending on new products related to all of our businesses in addition to higher wages and variable pay and additional expenses related to acquired businesses partially offset by favorable currency movements when compared to spending in 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was due to higher wages higher intangible amortization expense and higher transformational initiative expenses which was partially offset by lower discretionary expenditures including lower travel costs and favorable currency impact selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 selling general and administrative expenses increased due to increased wages and variable pay higher commissions higher legal expenses higher acquisition and integration costs and higher transformation initiatives expenses partially offset by operational efficiencies and savings and favorable currency impact 

total operating margin decreased 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2020 when compared to 2019 operating margin declined due to intangible and other asset impairments higher wages higher intangible amortization expense and higher transformational initiative expenses partially offset by lower discretionary expenditures including lower travel costs and favorable currency impact total operating margin was flat for the year ended october 31 2019 when compared to 2018 total operating margin was impacted by higher wages and variable pay higher acquisition and integration costs higher expenses related to tariffs and higher transformation initiatives expenses offset by operational efficiencies and savings and favorable currency impact 

interest income for the year ended october 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 8 million 36 million and 38 million respectively the decrease in interest income in 2020 was primarily due to lower interest rates for our cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 78 million 74 million and 75 million respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes credit facilities commercial paper and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts partially offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts 

  

at october 31 2020 our headcount was approximately 16400 compared to 16300 in 2019 

other income expense net 

for the year ended october 31 2020 other income expense net includes income of 12 million related to the provision of site service costs to and lease income from keysight technologies inc keysight the costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations other income expense net also includes net gains on the fair value of equity investments of approximately 27 million and income of 22 million related to the settlement of our legal claim against twist bioscience corporation

income taxes 



for 2020 the companys income tax expense was 123 million with an effective tax rate of 146 percent for the year ended october 31 2020 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates 

for 2019 the companys income tax benefit was 152 million with an effective tax rate of 165 percent for the year ended october 31 2019 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of 299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in singapore 

for 2018 the companys income tax expense was 630 million with an effective tax rate of 666 percent for the year ended october 31 2018 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of 552 million related to the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” consisting of 1 an expense of 499 million of us transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries and 2 an expense of 53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased us corporate tax rate 

the company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions in december 2018 the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 71 million 368 million and 87 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 023 116 and 027 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively of the 116 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share diluted in 2019 094 of the benefit relates to onetime items from the extension of the company’s tax incentive in singapore 

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

  

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

segment overview 

through october 31 2020 we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business diagnostics and genomics business and the agilent crosslab business

gross margin decreased 2 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019 gross margin declined due to the increased impact of pricing pressures and a net unfavorable impact from currency movements partially offset by favorable product mix and material cost savings gross margin was flat in 2019 compared to 2018 gross margin was impacted by unfavorable mix and higher expenses related to tariffs which was offset by favorable currency impact 

research and development expenses increased 1 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019 research and development expenses increased due to higher wages and additional expenses related to the biotek acquisition partially offset by lower discretionary spending and favorable impact from foreign currency movements research and development expenses decreased 1 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018 research and development decreased due to lower discretionary spending and a favorable currency offset by additional expenses related to acquisitions as well as higher wages and variable pay 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 selling general and administrative expenses increased due to higher wages and additional expenses related to the biotek acquisition partially offset by favorable impact from foreign currency movements and lower travel costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were impacted by higher wages and variable pay and additional expenses related to our recent acquisitions partially offset by operational savings and a favorable currency impact 

operating margin decreased 1 percentage point in 2020 compared to 2019 operating margin declined due to additional expenses related to our recent acquisitions and unfavorable gross margin due to pricing pressures partially offset by operational savings and favorable currency impact operating margin was relatively flat in 2019 compared to 2018 operating margin reflects relatively flat revenue growth partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses 

  

income from operations   

income from operations in 2020 increased by 6 million or increased by 1 percent when compared to 2019 on a revenue increase of 90 million the increase in income from operations was mainly due to the impact of the biotek acquisition income from operations in 2019 decreased by 1 million or was relatively flat when compared to 2018 on a revenue increase of 32 million the decrease was due to the impact of acquisitions

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2020 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 85 million within the next year approximately 23 million of the contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 13 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a longterm basis we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 52 percent of our revenue in 2020 51 percent of our revenue in 2019 and 53 percent of our revenue in 2018 were generated in us dollars the overall unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point in the year ended october 31 2020 we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2020 and 2019 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2020 and 2019 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

  

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended october 31 2019  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change further additional tariffs the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business 

  

operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business model business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that 

  

we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition a s a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business the eus general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

  

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of productrelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for example the eu has adopted the eu in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers will have until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr requirements for in vitro diagnostic medical devices currently on the market failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by the epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by 

  

companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have consolidated and may further consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

  

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and varian medical systems inc further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability further in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which 

  

could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

the us tax cuts and job act the tax act significantly changed the taxation of us based multinational corporations our compliance with the tax act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions the implementation of the tax act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service irs as well as state tax authorities the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we are party to a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured credit facility that will expire on march 13 2024 as of october 31 2019  the company had 115 million outstanding under the credit facility on august 7 2019 we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which provides for a 500 million shortterm loan facility that was used in full to complete the acquisition of biotek on october 21 2019 we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to 500 million  we had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of october 31 2019 we also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 18 billion in senior unsecured notes we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 



  

our credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1382 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition 

  

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the sec which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition  on november 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 

we enter into contracts to sell products services or combinations of products and services products may include hardware or software and services may include onetime service events or services performed over time 

we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606 revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation 

  

is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services the transaction price for equipment consumables and most software licenses control transfers to the customer at a point in time we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded 

service revenue includes extended warranty customer and software support including software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the service period as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

we have sales from standalone software these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis 

our multipleelement arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other startup services andor software andor support or services hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 

for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations 

a portion of our revenue relate to lease arrangements standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 840 leases each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a salestype capital lease using the current lease classification guidance 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary 

  

increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2019 and 2018  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2019  discount rates for the us plans decreased compared to the previous year for 2019 and 2018  the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2019  decreased compared to the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million in us pension expense and 13 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses 

in the us target asset allocations for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments our deferred profitsharing plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments approximately 3 percent of our us equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships outside the us our target asset allocation ranges from 31 to 60 percent to equities from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments and from zero to 25 percent to real estate depending on the plan all plans assets are broadly diversified due to fluctuations in equity markets our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31 2019 and 2018 differ from the target allocation our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation 

equity securities include exchangetraded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries government securities mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities derivative instruments and other other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent  the impact would be 4 million on us pension expense and 9 million on nonus pension expense for 2019  actual return on assets was above expectations which along with contributions during the year decreased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in an increase of the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 10 million expense in 2019  3 million benefit in 2018 and 15 million expense in 2017  the years ended october 31 2018 and 2017 included a gain on curtailment and settlements of 5 million and 32 million respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

in fiscal year 2019  we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill 

  

impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2019  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions specifically our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and inprocess research and development iprd acquired involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates discount rates and customer attrition rates our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates royalty rates and discount rates the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use actual results could differ materially from these estimates iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets during 2018 we recorded an impairment charge of 21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2019  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated during the year ended october 31 2019  2018 and 2017 there were no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 

  

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law the tax act significantly changed the existing us tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business there were no substantial changes from our 2018 annual report on form 10k to the transition tax expenses amount the company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined we have completed our analysis and elected to treat global intangible lowtax income gilti as “current period cost” see note 6 income taxes for more details

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage point for the year ended october 31 2019  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2018  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

income taxes 



for 2019 the companys income tax benefit was 152 million with an effective tax rate of 165 percent  for the year ended october 31 2019 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of 299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in singapore 

for 2018 the companys income tax expense was 630 million with an effective tax rate of 666 percent  for the year ended october 31 2018 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of 552 million related to the enactment of the tax act as discussed below 

for 2017 the company’s income tax expense was 119 million with an effective tax rate of 148 percent  our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate during the year the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested as such a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of us statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 this benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the us 

the company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions in december 2018 the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 other tax holidays are due for renewal in 2020 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 368 million  87 million  and 93 million in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 116  027  and 029 in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in the benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2019 in response to singapore tax law changes of the 116 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share diluted in 2019 094 of the benefit relates to onetime items from the singapore restructuring 

  

2017 us tax reform  tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law the tax act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018 including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate and 2 imposing a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the us 

the tax act also established new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019 including but not limited to 1 creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtax income “gilti” 2 generally eliminating us federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 4 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” 5 establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii 6 repealing domestic production activity deduction and 7 establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation 

asc 740 income taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 sab 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for the year ended october 31 2018 the company recognized income tax expense related to the tax act of 552 million which includes 1 an expense of 499 million of us transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries and 2 an expense of 53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased us corporate tax rate as described below 

deemed repatriation transition tax transition tax  the transition tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post1986 earnings and profits ep of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of nonus taxes paid tax pools on such earnings historically the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post1986 ep outside the us for the remaining portion the company previously accrued deferred taxes since the tax act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently the company recorded an income tax expense of 651 million for its onetime transition us federal tax and a benefit of 152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities the resulting 499 million net transition tax reduced by existing tax credits will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the tax act we have completed our accounting for charges related to the transition tax 

reduction of us federal corporate tax rate  the reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment the amount recorded for the year ended october31 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is 53 million  we have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes 

gilti the tax act subjects a us corporation to tax on its gilti us gaap allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either 1 treat taxes due on future gilti inclusions in the us taxable income as a currentperiod expense when incurred “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes “deferred method” we have completed our analysis and elected to treat gilti as a “current period cost” 

indefinite reinvestment assertion prior to the enactment of the tax act the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as a result of the enactment of the tax act we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries the company has recorded a deferred tax liability of 10 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2016 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2015 for significant states in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2009 

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income 

  

taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

  

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2019 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 16 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the abovementioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers in the past we recorded a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2019 and 2018  the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than 1 million these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 77 million within the next year approximately 25 million of the contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 14 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 51 percent of our revenue in 2019  53 percent of our revenue in 2018 and 51 percent of our revenues in 2017 were generated in us dollars the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended october 31 2019  we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2019 and 2018  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2019 and 2018  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

  

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenues by approximately 2  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2018  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and 

  

financial condition further additional tariffs which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business models business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to 

  

certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition a s a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous  jurisdictions  as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business the eus general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages 

we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us 

  

to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of productrelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy 

  

in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics 

  

providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination s  although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and varian medical systems inc further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission “sec” which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor 

  

could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

the 2017 united states tax cut and jobs act “tax act” significantly changed the taxation of us based multinational corporations our compliance with the tax act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions the implementation of the tax act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state tax authorities the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we 

  

may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 18 billion in senior unsecured notes we also are party to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019 on june 9 2015 we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by 300 million and on july 14 2017 the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional 300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total 1 billion as of october 31 2018  we had no  borrowings outstanding under the credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers 

  

or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2247 million  invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition 

we could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

net income was 316 million  in 2018  compared to net income of 684 million  and 462 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively net income for the year ended october 31 2018  was impacted by a discrete tax charge of 552 million related to the enactment of the tax act passed on december 22 2017 see note 4 income taxes for more details as of october 31 2018  and 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2247 million  and 2678 million  respectively 

 on november 22 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program the program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the companys employee equity incentive 

  

programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million  diluted shares for the year ended october 31 2016  we repurchased 2 million  shares for 98 million  which completed the purchases under this authorization 

on may 28 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program the 2015 repurchase program the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 114 billion  of our common stock at the companys discretion through and including november 1 2018 the 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during the year ended october 31 2016  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program we repurchased approximately 83 million  shares for 336 million  under this authorization during the year ended october 31 2017  we repurchased approximately 41 million  shares for 194 million  under this authorization during the year ended october 31 2018  we repurchased and retired approximately 64 million  shares for 422 million  under this authorization as of october 31 2018  we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 188 million  of our common stock under this program which expired on november 1 2018 

on november 19 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program the 2019 repurchase program designed among other things to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the companys employee equity incentive programs the 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 175 billion  of our common stock at the companys discretion and has no fixed termination date the 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended amended or discontinued at any time 

  during the year ended october 31 2018  cash dividends of 0596  per share or 191 million  were declared and paid on the companys outstanding common stock during the year ended october 31 2017  cash dividends of 0528  per share or 170 million  were declared and paid on the companys outstanding common stock during the year ended october 31 2016  cash dividends of 0460  per share or 150 million  were declared and paid on the companys outstanding common stock 

on november 14 2018  we declared a quarterly dividend of 0164  per share of common stock or approximately 52 million  which will be paid on january 23 2019  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on december 31 2018  the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors 

looking forward we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions improving our customers experience and growing our operating margin in addition we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs we expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue in 2019 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty 

  

evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straightline basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016 shares granted under the longterm performance program based on total shareholders return ltpptsr were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards ltpp based on operating margin “ltppom” and ltpp based on earnings per share “ltppeps” is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield the compensation cost for ltpp om and ltpp eps reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period in the case of ltppom the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant the performance targets for ltppeps grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3 respectively the probable shares to vest are estimated based on the forecasted om and eps at the time of the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date all awards granted after 2015 to our senior management employees have a one year postvest holding restriction the estimated discount associated with postvest holding restrictions is calculated using the finnerty model 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock for ltpp tsr grants in 2016 we used the 3year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies we believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use for the 2017 and 2018 ltpp tsr grants and calculation of the postvest discount using the finnerty model we used our own postseparation historical stock price volatility see note 3 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2018  and 2017  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2018  discount rates for the us plans 

  

increased compared to the previous year for 2018  and 2017  the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2018  slightly increased compared to the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million  in us pension expense and 16 million  on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent  the impact would be 4 million  on us pension expense and 9 million  on nonus pension expense for 2018  actual return on assets was below expectations which along with contributions during the year increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a decrease of the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 3 million  benefit in 2018  15 million benefit in 2017 and 3 million expense in 2016 the years ended october 31 2018  2017  and 2016 included a gain on curtailment and settlements of 5 million 32 million and 16 million respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

  in fiscal year 2018  we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2018  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no  impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets during 2018 we recorded an impairment charge of 21 million  related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable 

  

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2018  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated during the years ended october 31 2018  and 2017  there were no  impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets based on triggering events in the year ended october 31 2016  we recorded an impairment of 4 million  due to the cancellation of certain iprd projects 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2018 we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain us and us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law the tax act significantly changes the existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business asc 740 income taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date we have recognized the tax charge of 499 million due to transition tax liability and 53 million due to the impact of reduction in us tax rates in the period when the tax law was enacted as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations we have completed the accounting for all the impacts of the tax act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on global intangible lowtax income “gilti” inclusions see note 4 income taxes for more details these computations are based on the regulations and guidance already provided by federal and state tax authorities the company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2  percentage point for the year ended october 31 2018  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31 2017  when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

income taxes 



for 2018 the companys income tax expense was 630 million  with an effective tax rate of 666 percent  for the year ended october 31 2018 our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of 552 million  related to the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” as discussed below 

for 2017 the companys income tax expense was 119 million  with an effective tax rate of 148 percent  our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate during the year the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested as such a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of us statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 this benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the us 

for 2016 the company’s income tax expense was 82 million  with an effective tax rate of 151 percent  the income tax provision for the year ended october 31 2016 included net discrete tax expense of 17 million  primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method investment impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized 

the company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions in december 2018 the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 see note 19 subsequent events for more information other tax holidays are due for renewal between 2019 and 2020 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 87 million  93 million  and 86 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 027  029  and 026  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

2017 us tax reform  tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law the tax act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018 including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate and 2 imposing a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the us 

the tax act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019 including but not limited to 1 creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtax income “gilti” 2 generally eliminating us federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 4 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” 5 establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii 6 repealing domestic production activity deduction and 7 establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation 

  

the tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 due to our fiscal year end the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in resulting in a us statutory federal rate of 23 percent for our fiscal year ending october 31 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years 

asc 740 income taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 sab 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for the year ended october 31 2018 the company recognized income tax expense related to the tax act of 552 million  which includes 1 an expense of 499 million  of us transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries and 2 an expense of 53 million  associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased us corporate tax rate as described below as of october 31 2018 the company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the tax act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on gilti inclusions 

deemed repatriation transition tax transition tax  the transition tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post1986 earnings and profits ep of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of nonus taxes paid tax pools on such earnings historically the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post1986 ep outside the us for the remaining portion the company previously accrued deferred taxes since the tax act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently the company recorded an income tax expense of 651 million  for its onetime transition us federal tax and a benefit of 152 million  for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities the resulting 499 million  net transition tax reduced by existing tax credits will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the tax act we have completed our accounting for charges related to the transition tax 

reduction of us federal corporate tax rate  the reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment the amount recorded for the year ended october31 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is 53 million  we have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes 

gilti  the tax act subjects a us corporation to tax on its gilti us gaap allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either 1 treat taxes due on future gilti inclusions in the us taxable income as a currentperiod expense when incurred “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes “deferred method” our analysis of the new gilti rules and how they may impact us is incomplete accordingly we have not made a policy election regarding the treatment of gilti tax 

indefinite reinvestment assertion  prior to the enactment of the tax act the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as a result of the enactment of the tax act we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries the company repatriated 1921 million  of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018 the company has recorded a deferred tax liability of 11 million  for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states there were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2018 the us statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2014 expired in july 2018 the statute expiration resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 23 million  

in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001 

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate 

  

of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 14 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many 

  

locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2018  for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 14 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers in the past we recorded a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2018  the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than 1 million 1 million  as of october 31 2017  and less than 1 million  as of october 31 2016  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 80 million  within the next year approximately 27 million  of the new contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 15 years 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate effective may 1 2016 until april 30 2022 we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent  4 percent  or 5 percent  of an employees annual eligible compensation due to the us retirement plan benefits being frozen 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2018  or october 31 2017  

  

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our october 31 2018  balance sheet in millions

2 the transition tax payable may be adjusted based on our 2018 tax return filings 

other longterm liabilities as of october 31 2018 and october 31 2017 include 607 million  and 131 million  respectively related to longterm income tax liabilities of these amounts 215 million and 131 million related to uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2018  and october 31 2017  respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement the remaining 392 million in other longterm liabilities relates to the onetime transition tax payable after fiscal year 2019 the transition tax is payable beginning in fiscal year 2019 over eight years with 8 percent due in each of the first five years 15 percent in year six 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 53 percent of our revenue in 2018  51 percent of our revenue in 2017  and 54 percent of our revenues in 2016  were generated in us dollarsthe favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar has increased revenue by approximately 2  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2018  we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2018  and 2017  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2018  and 2017  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

  

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 71 percent  in fiscal 2017  70 percent  in fiscal 2016  and 70 percent  in fiscal 2015  the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china including hong kong were approximately 20 percent  in fiscal 2017  20 percent  in fiscal 2016  and 17 percent  in fiscal 2015  revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based on where we ship the products or provide the services 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 46 percent  in fiscal year 2017  and 44 percent  in fiscal year 2016  

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us financial information about our international operations is contained in note 19 segment information to our consolidated financial statements

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 



  

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 1  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2017  in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

  

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment 

integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business models business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses 

  

may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls however we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition in addition a s a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous  jurisdictions  as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive andor patient health data in the course of our business we must also comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies 

  

these regulations govern a wide variety of productrelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities 

certain properties we have previously owned are undergoing remediation for subsurface contaminations although we are indemnified for any liability relating to the required remediation we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled further other properties we have previously owned or facilities we have operated in the past may be contaminated based on our operations in some cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for any liabilities related to such contamination including companies that we used to be affiliated with such as hp inc hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company and varian medical systems inc while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if such environmental contamination is found to exist in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have 

  

assumed the costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations 

our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission “sec” which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 

  

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to taxes in the us singapore and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the us or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 19 billion in senior unsecured notes we also are party to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019 on june 9 2015 we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by 300 million and on july 14 2017 the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional 300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total 1 billion as of october 31 2017  we had 110 million  outstanding under the credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2678 million  invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition 

  

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

overview and executive summary 

agilent technologies inc we agilent or the company incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is a global leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied chemical markets providing application focused solutions that includes instruments software services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow 

on january 20 2017 we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the stock of multiplicom nv “multiplicom” a leading european diagnostics company with stateoftheart genetic testing technology and products for approximately 72 million in cash multiplicom headquartered in belgium develops manufactures and commercializes molecular diagnostic assays provided as kits which enable personalized medicine the financial results of multiplicom have been included within agilents from the date of the transaction 

on july 7 2017 we completed the acquisition of cobalt light systems “cobalt” for approximately 53 million in cash cobalt based in oxfordshire uk is a provider of differentiated raman spectroscopic instruments for the pharmaceutical industry applied markets and public safety cobalts suite of benchtop and handheldportable raman spectroscopic instruments are based on proprietary technologies that enable throughbarrier identification of chemicals and materials the financial results of cobalt have been included within agilents from the date of the transaction 

in fiscal year 2016 we completed the acquisition of seahorse bioscience seahorse for 242 million and ilab solutions llc ilab for 26 million the financial results of seahorse and ilab have been included within agilents from the date of the transaction on march 2 2016 we also made a preferred stock investment in lasergen for 80 million lasergen is a variable interest entity vie however we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance because of the nature of the preferred stock of lasergen that we own we account for this investment under the cost method 

agilents net revenue of 4472 million  in 2017  increased 6 percent  when compared to 2016  foreign currency movements for 2017  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2016  agilents net revenue of 4202 million  increased 4 percent in 2016  when compared to 2015  

revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 5 percent  in 2017 when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017  when compared to 2016 for the year ended october 31 2017 our performance within the life sciences markets was led by solid growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets within the applied markets there was strong growth in the chemical and energy food and environmental markets revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 1 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015 for the year ended october 31 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements acquisitions and the nmr business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets within the applied markets and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the nmr business for 2016 

  

when compared to 2015 there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets 

revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 9 percent  in 2017 when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had no overall currency impact on revenue growth in 2017 when compared to 2016 for the year ended october 31 2017 our performance within the clinical and diagnostics market continued to improve with strong revenue growth from our companion diagnostics and pathology businesses revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point in 2016 when compared to 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research markets continued to be strong led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended october 31 2016 when compared to the prior year 

revenue generated by agilent crosslab increased 8 percent  in 2017 when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016 revenue grew across all key end markets led by strong growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical chemical and energy and food markets revenue generated by agilent crosslab increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions there was growth in sales to all key markets the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets in addition we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets 

net income from continuing operations was 684 million  in 2017  compared to net income from continuing operations of 462 million  and 438 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively as of october 31 2017  and 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2678 million  and 2289 million  respectively 

 on november 22 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program the program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the companys employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million  diluted shares for the year ended october 31 2015  we repurchased 6 million  shares for 267 million  for the year ended october 31 2016  we repurchased approximately 24 million  shares for 98 million  which completed the purchases under this authorization 

on may 28 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program the 2015 repurchase program the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 114 billion  of our common stock at the companys discretion through and including november 1 2018 the 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time however we plan to repurchase a minimum of 674000 shares per quarter in fiscal year 2018 any additional repurchases may be impacted by our share price as well as other market conditions during the year ended october 31 2016  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program we repurchased approximately 83 million  shares for 336 million  under this authorization during the year ended october 31 2017  we repurchased approximately 41 million  shares for 194 million  under this authorization as of october 31 2017  we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 610 million  of our common stock under this program 

during fiscal year 2017 we retired 2942 million  treasury shares at an aggregate cost of 107 billion  the amount of which represents all of our previously repurchased shares over the past 12 years including 2017 repurchases also the retirement resulted in a decrease of 67 billion  to retained earnings and a decrease of 4 billion  to additional paidincapital 

 for the years ended october 31 2017  2016  and 2015  cash dividends of 170 million  150 million  and 133 million  were paid on the companys outstanding common stock respectively on november 15 2017  we declared a quarterly dividend of 0149  per share of common stock or approximately 48 million  which will be paid on january 24 2018  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 2 2018  the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors 

  

looking forward we expect to continue to focus on the growth of operating margin in our businesses by exploring new ways to simplify our operations differentiate product solutions and improve our customers experience in addition we remain focused on returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs we are entering fiscal year 2018 with good momentum however considering the macroeconomic and political uncertainties and corresponding poor visibility on our endmarkets for most of fiscal year 2018 we remain cautious on our revenue projections for most of fiscal year 2018 therefore we expect our revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market to moderate slightly downward in fiscal year 2018 although we experienced strong revenue growth within the chemical and energy market in fiscal year 2017 we are expecting lower revenue growth in fiscal year 2018 within the clinical and diagnostics market we 

  

remain optimistic about our revenue growth opportunities in these markets and continue to invest in expanding and improving our solutions portfolio the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1  percentage point for the year ended october 31 2017  costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016 shares granted under the longterm performance program based on total shareholders return ltpptsr were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards ltpp based on operating margin “ltppom” and ltpp based on 

  

earnings per share “ltppeps” is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield the compensation cost for ltpp om and ltpp eps reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period in the case of ltppom the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant the performance targets for ltppeps grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3 respectively the probable shares to vest are estimated based on the forecasted om and eps at the time of the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date all awards granted in 2017 and 2016 to our senior management employees have a one year postvest holding restriction the estimated discount associated with postvest holding restrictions is calculated using the finnerty model 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock for the stock option grants in 2015 and ltpp tsr grants in 2015 and 2016 we used the 3year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies we believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use for the 2017 ltpp tsr grants and calculation of the postvest discount using the finnerty model we used our own postseparation historical stock price volatility see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2017 and 2016 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2017 discount rates for the us plans were the same as the previous year for 2017 and 2016 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2017 were approximately the same as the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million on us pension expense and 16 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us pension expense and 9 million on nonus pension expense for 2017 actual return on assets was above expectations which along with contributions during the year decreased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in an improvement of the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded were a 15 million benefit in 2017 3 million expense in 2016 and 26 million expense in 2015 the year ended october 31 2017 and 2016 included a 32 million and 16 million respectively gain on curtailment and settlement 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

  

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

  in fiscal year 2017  we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2017  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no  impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2017  based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated during the year ended october 31 2017  there were no  impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets based on triggering events in the years ended october 31 2016  and 2015  we recorded an impairment of 4 million  and 3 million  respectively due to the cancellation of certain iprd projects 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2017 we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain us and us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the 

  

us in a future period of if there is a us tax law change with respect to taxation of accumulated foreign earnings our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

the us congress passed tax legislation on december 20 2017 which broadly reforms the corporate tax system but the legislation must be signed by the us president before it is considered enacted the tax reform could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax expenses andor net deferred tax assets the tax reform law would reduce the us corporate tax rate eliminates or limits deduction of several expenses which were previously deductible imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries requires a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permits a taxfree repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction we are evaluating the overall impact of the tax reform on our effective tax rate and balance sheet but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1  percentage point for the year ended october 31 2017  and 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016  costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended october 31 2017  and 2016  reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

costs and expenses 





total gross margin for the year ended october 31 2017  increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2017  reflects higher sales volume results from margin improvement initiatives lower amortization expense of intangible assets and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain partially offset by higher wages and variable pay total gross margin for the year ended october 31 2016  increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2016  were as a result of the exit of the nmr business several margin improvement initiatives lower logistics costs lower costs to address the now lifted fda warning letter offset by increased wages and variable pay 

total operating margin increased 4 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2017  when compared to last year operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margins the impact of lower amortization expense of intangible assets lower transformation initiatives costs lower acquisition and integration costs and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain when compared to last year total operating margin increased 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016  when compared to last year operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margin and the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain offset by the increased acquisition and integrations costs the impairment charge for investmentrelated loans and increased wages and variable pay 

gross inventory charges were 24 million in 2017 20 million in 2016 and 30 million in 2015 sales of previously written down inventory were 9 million in 2017 9 million in 2016 and 13 million in 2015 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to 

  

the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

research and development expenses increased 3 percent for the year ended october 31 2017  when compared with last year research and development expenditures increased due to increased spending on new products related to all of our businesses additional expenses related to increased headcount from acquisitions and higher wages and variable pay research and development expenses was relatively flat for the year ended october 31 2016  when compared with last year research and development expenditures increased by a 4 million inprocess research and development iprd impairment charge mostly offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2017  compared to 2016  selling general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets lower transformational initiatives lower acquisition and integration costs the impact of an employee pension settlement gain and reduced costs due to business improvement initiatives partially offset by higher wages and variable pay and additional selling general and administrative expenses associated with our recent acquisitions selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 selling general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition and integration costs related to recently acquired businesses higher wages and variable pay and an impairment charge related to equity method investment loans offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 79 million  72 million  and 66 million  respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts 

at october 31 2017  our headcount was approximately 13500  compared to 12500  in 2016  

other income expense net 

for the years ended october 31 2017  2016  and 2015  other income expense net includes income of 12 million  12 million  and 25 million  respectively related to the provision of certain it and site service costs to and lease income from keysight the costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from keysight over the next 23 years of approximately 12 million per year for the year ended october 31 2016 other income expense net also includes an 18 million expense related to the impairment of an investment 

income taxes 



for 2017 the companys income tax expense was 119 million  with an effective tax rate of 148 percent  our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate during the year the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested as such a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of us statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 this benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the us 

for 2016 the companys income tax expense was 82 million  with an effective tax rate of 151 percent the income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended october 31 2016 included net discrete tax expense of 17 million  primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method investment impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized 

for 2015 the company’s income tax expense from continuing operations was 42 million  with an effective tax rate of 87 percent the income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended october 31 2015 included a net discrete tax 

  

benefit of 55 million  primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service “irs audit in the us and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 93 million  86 million  and 65 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 029  026  and 019  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2014 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states there were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2017 the us statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 expired in july 2017 the statute expiration resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 40 million  this discrete tax benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the us 

on september 22 2015 we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for the tax years 2008 through 2011 the settlement resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 119 million  offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 99 million  principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 

in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 the company settled its ongoing tax audit in italy for the years 2011 to 2013 resulting in a net tax expense of 7 million the settlement resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 14 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 the company settled its ongoing tax audit in germany for the years 2005 to 2008 which resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 51 million 

with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement a final decision was entered by the us tax court on december 1 2015 at this time the us department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stockbased compensation the irs appealed the decision and filed its arguments opposing the tax court decision in june 2016 the case is currently in the appeals process in the ninth circuit due to the uncertainty surrounding the court’s decision we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

  

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2017  for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 15 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers in the past we recorded a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2017  the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 1 million  compared to less than 1 million  as of october 31 2016  and 5 million  as of october 31 2015  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 40 million  within the next year 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate effective may 1 2016 until april 30 2022 we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent  4 percent  or 5 percent  of an employees annual eligible compensation due to the us retirement plan benefits being frozen 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2017  or october 31 2016  

  

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2017  related to our debt and interest expense in millions 



1 the credit facility expires on september 15 2019 

other longterm liabilities include 131 million  and 190 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2017  and october 31 2016  respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposesto the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 51 percent of our revenue in 2017  54 percent of our revenue in 2016  and 57 percent of our revenues in 2015  were generated in us dollarsthe unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar has decreased revenue by approximately 1  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2017  the impact of foreign currency movements is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2017  and 2016  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2017  and 2016  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

agilent order fulfillment organizations 

our order fulfillment and supply chain organization “ofs” centralizes all order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses ofs provides resources for manufacturing engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses in general ofs employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses 

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 329 million  in 2016  330 million  in 2015  and 358 million  in 2014  the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarters orders therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

  

in connection with the sale of several of our businesses we have agreed to indemnity the buyers of such business their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future the continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the business that agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers as we well as other specified items including potential liabilities for environmental matters in our opinion the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of october 31 2016 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 70 percent  in fiscal 2016 70 percent  in fiscal 2015 and 75 percent  in fiscal 2014 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 20 percent  in fiscal 2016 16 percent  in fiscal 2015 and 13 percent  in fiscal 2014 revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based on where we ship the products or provide the services 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 44 percent  in fiscal year 2016 and 49 percent  in fiscal year 2015 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 19 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition and disposal of material assets 

on september 19 2013 agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies one comprising of the life sciences diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that retained the agilent name and the other one that comprised of the electronic measurement business that was renamed keysight technologies inc “keysight” keysight was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent on december 6 2013 on november 1 2014 we completed the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common shares of keysight to agilent stockholders who received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent held as of the close of business on the record date october 22 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers a large amount of our orders are backend loaded toward the end of our second and fourth fiscal quarters and their timing may be influenced by the sales incentive programs we have in place in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses 

demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

  

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 2  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2016  in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelvemonth period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

  

our strategic initiatives could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment in addition acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team and business infrastructure depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and the retention of key customers 

the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls in our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ended october 31 2015 management concluded that because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of october 31 2015 we remediated the material weakness for income tax as of october 31 2016 however we cannot be certain that we will be able to 

  

prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

integrating dako as may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of dako in addition the operation of dako within agilent may be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

 

even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration importexport controls trade restrictions and anticompetition these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of productrelated activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda or other regulatory 

  

agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other similar things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet 

  

product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and thirdparty package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control if one or more of the thirdparty package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

certain properties transferred to keysight technologies inc “keysight” as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by hp inc and hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company together hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to those keysight properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp we have agreed to indemnify hp with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations and keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at respectively properties transferred from hp to us and properties transferred by us to keysight while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago technologies ltd and advantest corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian inc “varian” we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea to each indemnify varian medical systems inc “vms” for certain costs relating to a environmental 

  

investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b epa or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal although any ultimate liability arising from environmentalrelated matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered unlikely based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission “sec” which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our 

  

intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax laws relating to transfer pricing or repatriation of capital any changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or any implementation of tax laws relating to proposals to curb base erosion and profit shifting or proposals for fundamental us and foreign corporate tax reform could lead to increases in overall tax liability which could materially impact our effective tax rate and have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations we are also subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 19 billion  in senior unsecured notes we also are party to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019 on june 9 2015 we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by 300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total 700 million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by 300 million in the aggregate subject to certain conditions as of october 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under the facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2289 million  invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

  

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation with keysight 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us the indemnity rights we have against keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

overview and executive summary 

agilent technologies inc we agilent or the company incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is a global leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied chemical markets providing application focused solutions that includes instruments software services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow 

in november 2015 we completed the acquisition of seahorse bioscience seahorse a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics for 242 million in cash seahorses technology enables researchers to better understand cell health function and signaling and how the cell may be impacted by the introduction of a specific drug by providing realtime kinetics to unlock essential cellular bioenergetics data the financial results of seahorse have been included within agilents consolidated financial statements from november 1 2015 

on march 2 2016 agilent made a preferred stock investment in lasergen for 80 million agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and we have also joined the board of lasergen and signed a collaboration agreement we have the option to acquire all of the remaining shares of lasergen until march 2 2018 for additional consideration of 105 million lasergen is a variable interest entity “vie” however we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance nor are we the primary beneficiary because of the nature of the preferred stock of lasergen that we own we account for this investment under the cost method 

on august 1 2016 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ilab solutions llc ilab a cloudbased solutions provider for core laboratory management  ilabs offerings enables customers to easily and accurately book time in shared facilities to bill and invoice for projects to manage studies to generate reports and business intelligence and to schedule instrument reservations across multiple projects the purchase price was 26 million in cash  the financial results of ilab have been included within agilents consolidated financial statements from august 1 2016 

agilents net revenue of 4202 million  in 2016  increased 4 percent when compared to 2015  foreign currency movements for 2016  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2015  agilents net revenue of 4038 million  was flat in 2015  when compared to 2014  

the life sciences and applied markets business brings together agilents analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics revenue increased 1 percent in 2016  when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016  when compared to 2015 for the year ended october 31 2016  and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements acquisitions and the nmr business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets within the applied markets and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the nmr business there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014 for the year ended october 31 2015 and 

  

excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year 

the diagnostics and genomics business includes genomics nucleic acid contract manufacturing and the pathology companion diagnostics and reagent partnership businesses revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets continued to be strong led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended october 31 2016 when compared to the prior year revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding foreign currency movements our growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets was strong in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year 

the agilent crosslab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions there was growth in sales to all key markets the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets in addition we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets in particular the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements 

net income from continuing operations was 462 million  in 2016  compared to net income from continuing operations of 438 million  and 232 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively as of october 31 2016  and 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2289 million  and 2003 million  respectively 

  on november 22 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program the existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the companys employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares for the years ended october 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we repurchased 24 million  shares for 98 million  6 million  shares for 267 million  and 4 million  shares for 200 million  respectively all such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method 

on may 28 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program the 2015 repurchase program the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 114 billion  of our common stock through and including november 1 2018 the 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during the year ended october 31 2016  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program we repurchased approximately 83 million  shares for 336 million  under this authorization all such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method 

 for the years ended october 31 2016  2015  and 2014  cash dividends of 150 million  133 million  and 176 million  were paid on the companys outstanding common stock respectively on november 16 2016 we declared a quarterly dividend of 0132  per share of common stock or approximately 43 million  which will be paid on january 25 2017  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 3 2017  the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors 

  

looking forward we expect to continue to focus on the growth of the operating margin in our businesses by simplifying our operations differentiating product solutions and improving our customers experience we anticipate returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs end market growth outlook in todays uncertain political and economic environment is unpredictable and challenging however we expect continued strength in the pharmaceutical markets and solid growth in the food and environmental markets but we remain uncertain about the growth in the chemical and energy markets the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2  percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016  costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period   we anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our performance for the near future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period in the fourth quarter of 2014 agilent announced it is exiting the nmr business and as a result recorded an excess inventory charge of 30 million for the year ended october 31 2015 and 2016 additional excess inventory charges were recorded in respect of the exiting of the nmr business of 4 million and 2 million respectively 

  

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model no stock options were granted in 2016 shares granted under the longterm performance program based on total shareholders return ltpptsr were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards and ltpp based on operating margin “ltppom” is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield the compensation cost for ltpp om reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date all awards granted in 2016 to our senior management employees have a one year postvest holding restriction and the value of these awards are adjusted for this 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock no options were granted in 2016 due to the separation of keysight on november 1 2014 expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 55 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies we believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of keysight is no longer relevant in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years for 2014 we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants which we believed was representative of future behavior see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 the company elected to early adopt new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of sharebased payments to employees for additional details related to the new guidance see note 2 new accounting pronouncements 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2015 and 2016 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2016 discount rates for the us plans decreased 75 basis points from the previous year for 2016 and 2015 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2016 decreased 60 basis points to 110 basis points from the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be less than 1 million on us pension expense and 16 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us pension expense and 7 million on nonus pension expense for 2016 actual return on assets was below expectations which along with contributions during the year increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a degradation of the funded status at year end the net 

  

periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were 3 million in 2016 26 million in 2015 and 15 million in 2014 the year ended october 31 2016 included a 16 million gain on curtailment and settlement 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

  in fiscal year 2016 we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2016 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

agilents indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2016 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated in the years ended october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded an impairment of 4 million 3 million and 4 million respectively due to the cancellation of certain iprd projects in addition in the year ended october 31 2014 we also recorded 12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our nmr business 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets 

  

that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our us deferred tax assets at october 31 2016 we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain us and us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2  percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016  and 6 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2015 costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended october 31 2016  and 2015 reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

costs and expenses 





total gross margin for the year ended october 31 2016  increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2016  were as a result of the exit of the nmr business several margin improvement initiatives lower logistics costs lower costs to address the now lifted fda warning letter offset by increased wages and variable pay total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2015  increased 2 percentage points when compared the prior year increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2015  were the result of lower intangible asset amortization favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency movements and wage increases 

total operating margin increased 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016  when compared to last year operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margin and the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain offset by the increased acquisition and integrations costs the impairment charge for investmentrelated loans and increased wages and variable pay total operating margins increased 3 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2015  when compared to last year operating margins improved due to increased gross margins and reduced expenses on lower revenue compared to last year

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to 

  

the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

research and development expenses was relatively flat for the year ended october 31 2016  when compared with last year research and development expenditures increased by a 4 million inprocess research and development iprd impairment charge mostly offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain research and development expenses decreased 8 percent for the year ended october 31 2015  when compared with last year rd expenditure decreased due to the impact of foreign currency movements savings from the exit from the nmr business and transformation initiatives offset by wage increases 

 selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2016  compared to 2015  selling general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition and integration costs related to recently acquired businesses higher wages and variable pay and an impairment charge related to equity method investment loans offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain selling general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2015  compared to 2014 there were increases in expenditure mostly due to the impact of wage increases higher commissions and costs associated with business improvement and transformation initiatives more than offset by favorable foreign currency movements and the decline in nmr expenses due to the exiting of that business together with a decrease in pre separation expenses related to the separation of keysight 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 72 million  66 million  and 110 million  respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts the decrease in interest expense in 2015  compared with 2014 is due to debt redemptions as part of the debt repositioning as a result of the separation of the keysight business 

at october 31 2016  our headcount was approximately 12500  compared to 11800  in 2015  

other income expense net 

for the year ended october 31 2016  other income expense net includes an 18 million expense related to the impairment of an investment and 12 million of income in respect of the provision of certain site service costs to and lease income from keysight the costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from keysight over the next 34 years of approximately 12 million per year for the year ended october 31 2015  other income expense net included 25 million of income in respect of the provision of certain it and site service costs to and lease income from keysight for the year ended october 31 2014 other income expense net included a net loss on the early redemption of senior notes of 89 million 

income taxes 



for 2016 the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 151 percent the income tax expense from continuing operations was 82 million the income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended october 31 2016 included net discrete tax expense of 17 million the net discrete tax expense for the year ended october 31 2016 included 5 million of tax benefit for the extension of the us research and development tax credit attributable to the companys prior fiscal year 6 million of tax expense related to the curtailment gain recognized with respect to the us retirement plan and supplemental benefits plan 18 million of tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized and a net 2 million of other discrete tax benefit included in the net 2 million discrete tax benefit are 9 million of outofperiod correcting tax expense entries recorded in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year of 2016 associated with german returntoprovision corrections these are offset by an 11 million outofperiod tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings the outofperiod corrections were determined to be immaterial to the previously issued and current period financial statements 

for 2015 the companys effective tax rate from continuing operations was 87 percent the income tax expense from continuing operations was 42 million the income tax benefit for the year ended october 31 2015 included a net discrete benefit 

  

of 55 million primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service irs audit in the us and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends 

for 2014 the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 13 percent the income tax benefit from continuing operations was 3 million the income tax benefit for the year ended october 31 2014 included a net discrete benefit of 33 million primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service “irs” audit in the us and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 86 million 65 million and 27 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 026 019 and 008 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on november 1 2014 agilent transferred deferred tax assets of 237 million deferred tax liabilities of 37 million current income tax payable of 40 million and other longterm liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling 8 million to keysight as part of its separation from agilent a current prepaid income tax asset of 19 million and longterm prepaid income tax asset of 3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to keysight upon separation from agilent in addition for the year ended october 31 2015 a 6 million return to provision adjustment for keysight associated with bonus depreciation was recognized through retained earnings 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states on september 22 2015 we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for the tax years 2008 through 2011 during the first quarter of 2016 we made a payment of approximately 9 million of tax plus interest as part of closing the exam in 2015 we reclassified a portion of other longterm liabilities to other accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations that we expected to pay within the next twelve months this amount was partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately 3 million that the irs allowed as an offset to the 12 million in incremental taxes the settlement resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 119 million offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 

on january 29 2014 we reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007 the settlement resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 111 million offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 

in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement a final decision was entered by the us tax court on december 1 2015 at this time the us department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stockbased compensation the irs notified the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on february 19 2016 of its intent to appeal the tax courts decision in the case we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case 

  

segment overview 

through october 31 2016 we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business diagnostics and genomics business and the agilent crosslab business

net revenue 



life science and applied markets business revenue in 2016 increased 1 percent compared to 2015 foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year geographically revenue declined 6 percent in the americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact revenue declined 8 percent in europe with a 4 percentage point unfavorable currency impact revenue grew 7 percent in japan with an 8 percentage point favorable currency impact revenue grew 14 percent in asia pacific excluding japan with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact strong growth in china led the geographic portfolio during 2016 and helped offset softness in the americas and europe liquid chromatography products revenue continued solid growth on strength in the pharmaceutical market revenue from mass spectrometry had instances of strength particularly in china which were offset by continued declines in revenue in the chemical and energy markets as well as diagnostic and clinical market declines in the americas life science and applied markets business revenue in 2015 decreased 2 percent compared to 2014 during 2015 we exited the research products business which reduced overall life sciences and applied markets growth by 2 percentage points product revenue results were otherwise solid across the rest of the product portfolio strength in the americas and europe pharmaceutical business were offset by softness in applied markets and life science research 

end market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2016 pharmaceutical market growth continued to be robust in 2016 driven by continuing technology refresh programs the growth led the way for life sciences and diagnostics markets which were offset somewhat by lower diagnostic and clinical sales notably in the us related to a slowdown in pain management related sales food and environmental markets driven by strong sales in china were areas of good growth in an otherwise weak applied market sector chemical and energy markets continued their declines throughout 2016 as oil prices remain low markets were also mixed for 2015 with pharmaceutical growth offset by delayed capital spending in life science research markets and chemical and energy weakness from low oil prices 

looking forward we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs we expect strong sales funnels given a number of significant new product introductions in the next few quarters as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio we remain concerned about short term prospects in chemical and energy markets but are confident in our product portfolio to address customer needs when the market does recover

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2016  for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 15 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers in the past we recorded a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2016  the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than 1 million compared to 5 million  as of october 31 2015  and 10 million  as of october 31 2014  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 62 million within the next year 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2016  or october 31 2015  

  

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2016  related to our longterm debt and interest expense in millions 



other longterm liabilities include 190 million  and 227 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2016  and october 31 2015  respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposesto the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 54 percent of our revenue in 2016 57 percent of our revenue in 2015 and 61 percent of our revenues in 2014 were generated in us dollarsthe unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar has decreased revenue by approximately 2  percentage points in the year ended october 31 2016  the impact of foreign currency movements is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2016  and 2015  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2016  and 2015  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

agilent order fulfillment organizations 

our order fulfillment and supply chain organization “ofs” centralizes all order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses ofs provides resources for manufacturing engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses in general ofs employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses 

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 330 million in 2015 358 million in 2014 and 337 million in 2013 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarters orders therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

  

materials 

our life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

certain properties transferred to keysight as part of the separation are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by hp inc and hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company together hp in addition a subset of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination in connection with the separation of keysight hp has agreed to transfer that indemnity to keysight the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation of keysight if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us it is also possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named under a remediation order the naming of agilent will not affect hp’s obligation to indemnify us or keysight with regard to these matters under our agreement with hp and now hp’s agreement with keysight hp will have access to those keysight properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that operations will not be interrupted or that keysight will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

according to the separation agreement with keysight we are liable and are indemnifying keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at properties transferred by us to keysight while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters other than the remediation by hp there is no guarantee that such contamination does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian inc varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian 

  

semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2015 75 percent in fiscal 2014 and 72 percent in fiscal 2013 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2015 13 percent in fiscal 2014 and 16 percent in fiscal 2013 revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 49 percent in fiscal year 2015 and 54 percent in fiscal year 2014 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 22 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition and disposal of material assets 

on september 19 2013 agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies one comprising of the life sciences diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that retained the agilent name and the other one that comprised of the electronic measurement business that was renamed keysight technologies inc “keysight” keysight was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent on december 6 2013 on november 1 2014 we completed the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common shares of keysight to agilent stockholders who received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent held as of the close of business on the record date october 22 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers a large amount of our orders are backend loaded toward the end of our second and fourth fiscal quarters and their timing may be influenced by the sales incentive programs we have in place in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

demand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidation spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

  

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in the year ended october 31 2015 in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

  

our strategic initiatives could have longterm adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions 

we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and the retention of key customers 

the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 as further described in part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” management has concluded that because of a material weakness in accounting for income taxes our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of october 31 2015 the company has and will continue to enhance its controls and expects to remediate the material weakness however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

  

integrating dako as may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of dako in addition the operation of dako within agilent may be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

 

even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected as a result the dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

some of our products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the us that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

  

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our 

  

results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

certain properties transferred to keysight as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by hp inc and hewlettpackard enterprise formerly hewlettpackard company together hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to those keysight properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp we have agreed to indemnify hp with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations and keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at respectively properties transferred from hp to us and properties transferred by us to keysight while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and advantest corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 

  

1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our 

  

intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

  

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 16 billion in senior unsecured notes and a 38 million secured mortgage we also are party to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019 on june 9 2015 we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by 300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total 700 million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by 300 million in the aggregate subject to certain conditions we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

 24 

  

  

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 20 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is 

  

taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation with keysight 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us the indemnity rights we have against keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition

on november 1 2014 we completed the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common shares of keysight technologies inc keysight to agilent stockholders who received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent held as of the close of business on the record date october 22 2014 the historical results of operations and the financial position of keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of agilent and are reported as discontinued operations within this form 10k for additional information see note 4 discontinued operations 

the results from operations presented within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are reported for the continuing operations of agilent income taxes are presented on a revised basis for prior periods see note 2  revision of prior period financial statements 

in november 2014 we announced a change in organizational structure designed to better serve our customers our life sciences business excluding the nucleic acid solutions division together with the chemical analysis business combined to form a new segment called life sciences and applied markets business our diagnostics and genomics businesses combined with the nucleic acid solutions division from our life sciences business and became the diagnostics and genomics segment finally the agilent crosslab segment was formed from the services and consumables businesses previously part of the life sciences and chemical analysis businesses financial reporting under this new structure is included within this report on form 10k and historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation within our financial statements 

on april 30 2015 we announced that we have completed an agreement with rigaku a privately held scientific instrumentation company headquartered in tokyo to acquire agilents xray diffraction xrd business a key manufacturer of singlecrystal xray instruments for the global chemical crystallography market the transaction did not have a material impact to our results of operations statement of financial position or statement of cash flows in the current or prior fiscal periods 

on may 19 2015 we announced that we have completed the acquisition of 100 of the shares of cartagenia a leading provider of software and services for clinical genetics and molecular pathology laboratories for €60 million cartagenia provides software solutions for variant assessment and reporting of clinical genomics data from nextgeneration sequencing and microarrays the cartagenia bench platform enables technicians laboratory directors and clinicians to visualize assess and report clinical genetics data in the context of patient information 

on november 2 2015 we announced that we have completed the acquisition of seahorse bioscience seahorse a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioengergetics for 242 million in cash seahorses 

  

technology enables researchers to better understand cell health function and signaling and how the cell may be impacted by the introduction of a specific drug by providing realtime kinetics to unlock essential cellular bioenergetics data the financial results of seahorse will be included within agilents from the beginning of the first quarter of 2016 

agilents net revenue of 4038 million in 2015 was flat when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements for 2015 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 6 percentage points compared to 2014 agilents net revenue of 4048 million increased 4 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 

the life sciences and applied markets business brings together agilents analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 5 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014 in addition an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage point in 2015 was largely due to the nmr business which we are exiting for the year ended october 31 2015 and excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year revenue from sales to the life sciences and applied markets business increased 2 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 for the year ended october 31 2014 our performance within the life sciences business improved with sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from the life sciences research market when compared to the prior year within applied markets there was revenue growth from sales to all markets in the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to the prior year 

the diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of three areas of activity first we are focused on pathology companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships second the genomics business includes our arrays ngs target enrichment and our other genomics solutions third the nucleic acid solutions business manufactures synthetic rna to be potentially used as active pharmaceutical ingredients revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 8 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research market was strong in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year revenue increased 5 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 for the year ended october 31 2014 our performance within the diagnostics and genomics business improved from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets when compared to the prior year 

the agilent crosslab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 7 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets in particular the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to last year within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements revenue increased 7 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 revenue growth from sales to all markets was similar to that of our life sciences and applied markets business in the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to last year 

net income from continuing operations was 438 million in 2015 compared to net income from continuing operations of 232 million and 225 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively as of october 31 2015 and 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2003 million and 2218 million respectively 

  on november 22 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program the existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the companys employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares for the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 6 million shares for 267 million 4 million shares for 200 million and 20 million shares for 900 million respectively all such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method on may 28 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program the 2015 repurchase program the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 114 billion of our common stock through and including november 1 2018 the 2015 share repurchase program will commence at the option of the company on either november 1 2015 or the date on which we complete the purchase of the remaining 98 million for a total of 365 million of common stock in fiscal 2015 under the existing stock repurchase program upon commencement the 2015 share repurchase program replaces our existing stock repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of shares to reduce or 

  

eliminate share dilution from equity programs the 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

for the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 cash dividends of 133 million 176 million and 156 million were paid on the companys outstanding common stock respectively on november 19 2015 we declared a quarterly dividend of 0115 per share of common stock or approximately 38 million which will be paid on january 27 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 5 2016 the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors 

in 2015 we introduced an improvement initiative to transform a number of the companys operations these actions produced savings of approximately 40 million in total in 2015 

looking forward we expect to focus on organic growth and expand the operating margin of our businesses in addition we anticipate returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 6 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2015 costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period   we anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our performance for the near future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing 

  

necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period in the fourth quarter of 2014 agilent announced it is exiting the nmr business and as a result recorded an excess inventory charge of 30 million for the year ended october 31 2015 additional excess inventory charges were recorded in respect of the exiting of the nmr business of 4 million 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the longterm performance program ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock due to the separation of keysight on november 1 2014 expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 55 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies we believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of keysight is no longer relevant for the grants of options prior to november 1 2014 the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilent’s stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of 58 years a 10 percent increase in our historical estimated volatility from 28 percent to 38 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 31 percent if no other factors were changed 

for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years for 2013 to 2014 we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants which we believe is representative of future behavior see note 5 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 

  

for both us and nonus plans for 2014 and 2015 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio in 2015 discount rates for the us plans remained relatively flat from the previous year for 2015 and 2014 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2015 remained the same or decreased from the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 5 million on us pension expense and 12 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 3 million on us pension expense and 8 million on nonus pension expense for 2015 actual return on assets was below expectations which along with contributions during the year increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a degradation of the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were 26 million in 2015 15 million in 2014 and 36 million in 2013 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50  chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

  in fiscal year 2015 we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments life sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab due to the new segment structure in november 2014 we performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30 2015 based on the results of our testing the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6  months to 15  years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents condensed consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

agilents indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2015 based on the results of our qualitative 

  

testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated in the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded an impairment of 3 million 4 million and zero respectively due to the cancellation of certain iprd projects in addition in the year ended october 31 2014 we also recorded 12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our nmr business 

restructuring and exit of nmr business during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance “nmr” product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment 

the main components of expenses are related to workforce reductions assets impairments and writedowns and special charges to inventory which mainly relates to exiting of one of our businesses workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits that the employees are entitled to becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated we have also assessed the recoverability of our longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows asset impairments primarily consist of property plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and inventory writtendown to net realizable value if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our us deferred tax assets at october 31 2015 we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

  

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 3 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

exit of nmr business 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance “nmr” product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment the exit of the nmr business was primarily due to the lack of growth and profitability of the product line these actions involved severance and other personnel costs related to the workforce reduction of approximately 300 employees primarily located in the united kingdom and california and noncash charges related to intangible asset impairments and other asset writedowns including inventory after including employee reductions due to attrition and the application to open positions and acceptance of employment within the company of some employees previously affected we have approximately 30 employees that are pending termination under the above actions as of october 31 2015 we expect to complete these restructuring activities by early fiscal 2016 for the year ended october 31 2015 the exit of the nmr business has positively impacted our operating profit by 15 million as of october 31 2015 approximately 15 million was paid to date under these restructuring activities we will continue to provide service support to the nmr installed base 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 6 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2015 costs and expenses incurred in local currency were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended october 31 2015 reducing our overall net exposure the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

the diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of three areas of activity first we are focused on pathology companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships second the genomics business includes our arrays ngs target enrichment and our other genomics solutions third the nucleic acid solutions business manufactures synthetic rna to be potentially used as active pharmaceutical ingredients revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 8 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research market was strong in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to the prior year revenue increased 5 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 for the year ended october 31 2014 our performance within the diagnostics and genomics business improved from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets when compared to the prior year 

the agilent crosslab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 7 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets in particular the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to last year within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements revenue increased 7 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 revenue growth from sales to all markets was similar to that of our life sciences and applied markets business in the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to last year 

services and other revenue includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting including companion diagnostics services and other revenue increased 4 percent in 2015 as compared to 2014 the service and other revenue growth is impacted by a portion of the revenue being driven by the current and previously installed product base service and other revenue increased due to increased service contract renewals laboratory productivity services and strong companion diagnostics revenue services and other revenue increased 6 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013 

  

costs and expenses 





total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2015 increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2015 were the result of lower intangible asset amortization favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency movements and wage increases total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2014 were flat when compared to prior year total gross margins for the year ended october 31 2014 were impacted by favorable product mix offset by higher regulatory costs to address an fda warning letter which is now lifted and wage increases 

total operating margins increased 3 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to last year operating margins improved due to increased gross margins and reduced expenses on lower revenue compared to last year total operating margins increased 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to last year in 2014 there were higher costs as a result of the exit from the nmr business together with some pre separation expenses associated with the separation of keysight 

gross inventory charges included in continuing operations were 30 million in 2015 46 million in 2014 and 27 million in 2013 sales of previously written down inventory included in continuing operations were 13 million in 2015 8 million in 2014 and 6 million in 2013 

  

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct three types of research and development basic research foundation technologies and life sciences our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software systems and solutions life sciences and diagnostics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

research and development expenses decreased 8 percent for the year ended october 31 2015 when compared with last year rd expenditure decreased due to the impact of foreign currency movements savings from the exit from the nmr business and transformation initiatives offset by wage increases research and development expenses increased 6 percent for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared with last year rd expenditure increased due to continued investment in next generation products and expanding our product portfolios 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 there were increases in expenditure mostly due to the impact of wage increases higher commissions and costs associated with business improvement and transformation initiatives more than offset by favorable foreign currency movements and the decline in nmr expenses due to the exiting of that business together with a decrease in pre separation expenses related to the separation of keysight selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 selling general and administrative expenditure increased mostly due to the impact of wage increases and higher commissions 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 66 million 110 million and 107 million respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon 

  

termination of interest rate swap contracts the decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared with 2014 and 2013 is due to debt redemptions as part of the debt repositioning as a result of the separation of the keysight business 

at october 31 2015 our headcount was approximately 11800 compared to 11900 in 2014 

other income expense net 

for the year ended october 31 2015 other income expense net includes 25 million of income in respect of the provision of certain it and site service costs to and lease income from keysight the costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from keysight over the next 45 years of approximately 13 million per year for the year ended october 31 2014 other income expense net included a net loss on the early redemption of senior notes of 89 million 

income taxes 



for 2015 the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 87 percent the income tax expense from continuing operations was 42 million the income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended october 31 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of 55 million the net discrete tax benefit for the year ended october 31 2015 included 32 million of net tax benefit primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service “irs audit in the us and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends to the us the remaining 23 million net tax benefit for the year ended october 31 2015 included 16 million of tax benefit related to the deregistration of certain foreign branches and statutue of limitations lapses 6 million of tax benefit for the extension of the us research and development tax credit attributable to the companys prior fiscal year and 1 million of other discrete benefits 

for 2014 the companys effective tax rate from continuing operations was 13 percent the income tax benefit from continuing operations was 3 million the income tax benefit for the year ended october 31 2014 included a net discrete benefit of 33 million primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service irs audit in the us and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends 

for 2013 the effective tax rate from continuing operations was 234 percent the 234 percent effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory rates in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2016 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 65 million 27 million and 44 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 019 008 and 013 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on november 1 2014 agilent transferred deferred tax assets of 237 million deferred tax liabilities of 37 million current income tax payable of 40 million and other longterm liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling 8 million to keysight as part of its separation from agilent a current prepaid income tax asset of 19 million and longterm prepaid income tax asset of 3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to keysight upon separation from agilent in addition 

  

for the year ended october 31 2015 a 6 million return to provision adjustment for keysight associated with bonus depreciation was recognized through retained earnings 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states on september 22 2015 we reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2008 through 2011 we expect to make a payment of approximately 9 million as part of closing the exam as a result in 2015 we reclassified a portion of other longterm liabilities to other accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations that we expect to pay within the next twelve months this amount is partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately 3 million that the irs is allowing as an offset to the 12 million in incremental taxes the settlement resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 119 million offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 

on january 29 2014 we reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007 the settlement resulted in the recognition within the continuing operations of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 111 million offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 

in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings where applicable given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement a final decision was entered by the us tax court on december 1 2015 at this time the us department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stockbased compensation the irs has the right to appeal the us tax court decision we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case

net revenue 



life science and applied markets business revenue in 2015 decreased 2 percent compared to 2014 foreign currency movements for 2015 had an unfavorable impact of 5 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year geographically revenue grew 4 percent in the americas with a 3 percentage point unfavorable currency impact grew 2 percent in asia pacific excluding japan with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact declined 8 percent in europe with a 10 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and declined 20 percent in japan with a 13 percentage point unfavorable currency impact double digit revenue growth in the pharmaceutical market helped drive the revenue growth in the americas but was partially offset by declines in the life science and research market due to reductions in academia and government spending in europe our pharmaceutical market revenue growth was not enough to offset declines in revenue from our life science and research market and softness in applied markets product revenue results were led by solid demand across the entire product folio offset by decline in nmr revenue reducing overall growth by 2 percentage points life science and applied markets business revenue in 2014 increased 2 percent compared to 2013 product revenue results in 2014 were led by growth in gcms and spectroscopy and partially offset by declines in lcms and nmr 

end market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2015 our pharmaceutical and biotechnology market revenue growth was strong and driven by technology refreshes larger pharmaceutical companies continue to upgrade to the latest technologies and help drive revenue growth in this market in life science research reduced budgets and delayed spending on capital equipment from government entities led to a decline in revenue in this market segment applied market revenue growth was weaker primarily due to the revenue from the chemical and energy market where lower oil prices have reduced capital spending excluding currency movements and the nmr business environmental decreased when compared to last year as weakness in the us oil and gas markets is now spreading to related environmental testing markets sales to the food market were down slightly when compared to last year excluding currency movements and the nmr business revenue growth in 2014 was led by strong pharmaceutical sales and moderate revenue growth in applied markets partially offset by a reduction in revenue from the life science and research markets compared to the prior year 

looking forward we are optimistic about continued growth from pharmaceutical sales and the technology replacement business from our strong portfolio offering while low spending levels in life science research and reduced chemical and energy spending continue to be a concern we continue to see opportunities for customers buying replacement instruments and we will keep strengthening our product and technology portfolio accordingly

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 18 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2015 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 18 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 38 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2015 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 5 million compared to 10 million as of october 31 2014 and less than 1 million as of october 31 2013 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel contracts without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contacts termination period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 53 million within the next year 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

  

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2015 or october 31 2014 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2015 related to our longterm debt and interest expense in millions 



other longterm liabilities include 227 million and 286 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2015 and october 31 2014 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 57 percent of our revenue in 2015 61 percent of our revenues in 2014 and 63 percent of our revenues in 2013 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2015 and 2014 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management has evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of october 31 2015 pursuant to and as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 “exchange act” based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of october 31 2015 the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e under the exchange act were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

notwithstanding the identified material weakness management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer believes the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with us gaap 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control  integrated framework   2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso as a result of that evaluation management concluded that a material weakness exists as described below a material weakness is “a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant’s annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis” 

during the year ended october 31 2015 management identified certain errors in the tax accounts primarily related to prior years and as a result concluded that the company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes specifically certain controls activities over the completeness and accuracy of our accounting for i us taxes on foreign earnings ii international provision for income taxes and iii reconciliation of income taxes payable were not performed on a timely basis or at the appropriate level of precision the errors identified by management during the year ended october 31 2015 when combined with errors identified in prior years resulted in the company revising its consolidated financial statements as of october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 for the years ended october 31 2014 and 2013 and for each of the quarters of the years ended october 31 2015 and 2014 these control deficiencies in the accounting for income taxes could result in a material misstatement that would not be prevented or detected 

because of the material weakness management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2015 based on criteria in internal control  integrated framework   2013 issued by coso 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2015 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during agilents last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

material weakness remediation efforts 

  

management has and will continue to enhance its controls which include refinements and enhancements to the design including the review and supervision and the level of precision of certain controls over the accounting for income taxes enhancements previously made to certain controls contributed to the identification of the errors which impacted prior periods the company’s enhanced controls however had an insufficient period of time to operate for management to conclude that they were operating effectively as such at october 31 2015 there continues to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement related to the accounting for income taxes may still not be prevented or detected with the effective operation of these enhanced controls the company expects remediation of the material weakness in fiscal 2016

life sciences and diagnostics markets 

our life sciences and diagnostics business focuses primarily on the following three markets 

the pharmaceutical biotechnology cro  cmo market   this market consists of “forprofit” companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research discovery  development clinical trials manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control one subsegment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies “pharma” a second subsegment includes biotechnology companies “biotech” contract research organizations “cros” and contract manufacturing organizations “cmos” biotech companies and to a somewhat lesser extent cros and cmos typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain additionally due to the relatively low drug efficacy within oncology pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated tests to the market with their new drugs 

the life science research market   this market consists primarily of “notforprofit” organizations and includes academic institutions large government institutes and privately funded organizations the life science research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for pharmaceutical and molecular diagnostics companies after decades 

  

of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies the focus has widened to include translational research  multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at accelerating therapy development 

the diagnostics and clinical market  a significant part of our clinical diagnostic customers are in pathology labs throughout the world our highquality automated pathology tissue staining platforms and solutions are used most heavily by the large labs located in hospitals medical centers and reference labs the market is skewed towards the mature economies with most of the market in north america western europe and japan the mix is changing however as emerging markets increase spending on human health    

the clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing including “forprofit” reference laboratories hospital labs and molecular diagnostic companies while these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics “ivd” labeled testing kits they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests analyte specific reagents “asrs” are often used by these labs

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 719 million in 2014 704 million in 2013 and 668 million in 2012 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods 

  

that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

 on october 31 2014  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 430 million as compared to approximately 380 million at october 31 2013  within our life sciences and diagnostics business our unfilled backlog was approximately 530 million on october 31 2014  as compared to approximately 520 million at october 31 2013  

on october 31 2014  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 780 million as compared to approximately 760 million at october 31 2013  it is expected that the unfilled backlog will be fulfilled by keysight which separated from agilent on november 1 2014 

we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal our electronic measurement chemical analysis life sciences and diagnostics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

certain properties transferred to keysight as part of the separation are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company hewlettpackard company hp in addition a subset of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination in connection with the separation of keysight hp has agreed to transfer that indemnity to keysight the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation of keysight if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us it is also possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named under a remediation order the naming of agilent will not affect hp’s obligation to indemnify us or keysight with regard to these matters under our agreement with hp and now hp’s agreement with keysight hp will have access 

  

to those keysight properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that operations will not be interrupted or that keysight will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

according to the separation agreement we are liable and are indemnifying keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at properties transferred by us to keysight while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters other than the remediation by hp there is no guarantee that such contamination does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2014 70 percent in fiscal 2013 and 68 percent in fiscal 2012 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2014 17 percent in fiscal 2013 and 16 percent in fiscal 2012 approximately 9 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2014 9 percent in fiscal 2013 and 10 percent in fiscal 2012 was derived from japan revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 58 percent in fiscal year 2014 58 percent in fiscal year 2013 and 60 percent in fiscal year 2012 approximately 13 13 and 12 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

  

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition and disposal of material assets 

on september 19 2013 agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies one comprising of the life sciences diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that will retain the agilent name and the other one that will be comprised of the electronic measurement business that will be renamed keysight technologies inc “keysight” keysight was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent on december 6 2013 on november 1 2014 we completed the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common shares of keysight to agilent stockholders who received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent held as of the close of business on the record date october 22 2014 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 agilent announced that it is exiting its nuclear magnetic resonance business nmr agilent will stop taking new nmr system orders but the company will continue to meet customer commitments for orders in progress and for ongoing support contracts and continue to provide service on all installed nmr systems the company expects that this decision will eliminate about 300 jobs mostly within the next 12 months 

on june 21 2012 we acquired dako through the purchase of 100 of the share capital of dako a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of denmark under the share purchase agreement dated may 16 2012 dako provides antibodies reagents scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories as a result of the acquisition dako has become a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the consideration paid was approximately 2143 billion of which 14 billion was paid directly to the seller and 743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of dako agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in 

  

 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

demand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidation spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

  

we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year for example in the past we completed various acquisitions including dako as as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause 

  

investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations further if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

integrating dako as may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of dako in addition the operation of dako within agilent could be a difficult costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

   

even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect as a result the dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

  

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a number of our products from our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products any such fda actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in august 2013 dako denmark as received a warning letter from the fda relating to its quality management processes at our glostrup facility although we are committed to addressing the issues raised by the fda there can be no assurance that the fda will be satisfied with the steps we have taken to address the issues or that the fda will not raise additional areas of concern we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the fda including import bans seizures injunction andor civil penalties and any such actions could have an adverse impact on our business financial position and results of operations 

some of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the us that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger 

  

competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

  

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

certain properties transferred to keysight as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by the hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to those keysight properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp we have agreed to indemnify hp with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations and keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at  respectively properties transferred from hp to us and properties transferred by us to keysight while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of 

  

those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the new rule which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country while we filed our initial report for calendar year 2013 there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available 

  

under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

  

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

  

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 27 billion in senior unsecured notes including 11 billion in keysight senior unsecured notes and a 42 million secured mortgage we also are a party to a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019 and under which we may borrow up to 400 million and a danish krone denominated credit facility equivalent to 9 million we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock keysight is a party to a fiveyear revolving credit facility which expires in october 2019 for 300 million initially guaranteed by us the guarantee was terminated upon the completion of the separation of keysight on november 1 2014 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

   

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

  

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 30 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us the indemnity rights we have against keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing 

  

necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period in the fourth quarter of 2014 agilent announced it is exiting the nmr business and as a result recorded an excess inventory charge of 30 million 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the longterm performance program ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield on january 17 2012 the companys board of directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to the companys shareholders the fair value of all the awards granted prior to the declaration of quarterly cash dividend was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilents stock option over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life a 10 percent increase in our historical estimated volatility from 39 percent to 49 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 23 percent if no other factors were changed 

for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years for 2012 to 2014 we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants which we believe is representative of future behavior see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2014 and 2013 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan 

  

benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio and decreased in 2014 from the previous year for 2014 and 2013 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2014 decreased from the previous year if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 8 million on us pension expense and 21 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 10 million on us pension expense and 17 million on nonus pension expense for 2014 actual return on assets was above expectations which along with contributions during the year reduced next year’s pension cost as well as improved the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were 13 million in 2014 58 million in 2013 and 52 million in 2012 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 

 in fiscal year 2014 we assessed goodwill impairment for our four reporting units which consisted of two segments chemical analysis and electronic measurement and two reporting units under the life sciences and diagnostics segment the first of these two reporting units related to our life sciences business and the second related to our diagnostics business we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the four reporting units as of september 30 2014 based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

  

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the assets useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straightline method ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents condensed consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

agilents indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allowed the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets as of september 30 2014 based on the results of our qualitative 

  

testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinitelived intangible asset is indicated in the years ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded an impairment of 4 million 1 million and 1 million respectively due to the cancellation of certain iprd projects in addition in the year ended october 31 2014 we also recorded 12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our nmr business 

restructuring and exit of nmr business the main components of expenses are related to workforce reductions assets impairments and writedowns and special charges to inventory which mainly relates to exiting of one of our businesses workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits that the employees are entitled to becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated we have also assessed the recoverability of our longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows asset impairments primarily consist of property plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and inventory writtendown to net realizable value if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our us deferred tax assets at october 31 2014 we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

  

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring and exit of nmr business 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance “nmr” product line within our life sciences and diagnostics segment the exit of the nmr business was primarily due to the lack of growth and profitability of the product line in connection with the exit we have recorded approximately 68 million in restructuring and other related costs associated with the closure of nmr these costs are comprised of severance and other personnel costs related to the workforce reduction of approximately 300 employees primarily located in the united kingdom and california and noncash charges related to intangible asset impairments and other asset writedowns including inventory we expect to substantially complete these restructuring activities by the end of fiscal 2016 the exit of the nmr business is expected to result in a positive impact of approximately 10 million in operating profit in fiscal year 2015 as of october 31 2014 substantially all employees are pending termination under the above actions and approximately 2 million was paid under the above actions 

in the second quarter of 2013 we accrued for a targeted restructuring program to reduce agilents total headcount by approximately 450 regular employees representing approximately 2 percent of our global workforce in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 agilent announced plans to separate the electronic measurement business from agilent which was completed on november 1 2014 as a result approximately 50 employees from the targeted restructuring plan have been redeployed within the company reducing the total headcount under this plan to 400 employees the timing and scope of workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements when completed the restructuring program expected to result in an approximately 50 million reduction in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over the three business segments in addition we have been streamlining our manufacturing operations as part of this action we anticipate the reduction of approximately 250 positions to reduce our annual cost of sales 

for the year ended october 31 2014 we reversed 4 million in restructuring charges associated with employees that have been redeployed within the company within the us we have substantially completed these restructuring activities internationally we expect to complete almost all of these restructuring activities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as of october 31 2014 approximately 70 employees including keysight employees are pending termination and approximately 46 million was been paid under the above actions in the year ended october 31 2014 we have realized the expected savings within our three business segments as a result of these restructuring activities 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

results from operations 

  

orders and net revenue 



  



in general recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months 

agilents total orders in 2014 were 7134 million an increase of 4 percent when compared to 2013 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to 2013 within our life sciences and diagnostics business orders increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 chemical analysis orders increased 6 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013 and electronic measurement businesses orders increased 3 percent when compared to 2013 agilents total orders in 2013 were 6827 million a decrease of 1 percent when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended 2013 when compared to 2012 

agilents net revenue of 6981 million in 2014 increased 3 percent when compared to 2013 foreign currency movements for 2014 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2013 within our life sciences and diagnostics business revenue increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 there was growth in demand for life sciences and diagnostics products and services led by pharmaceutical and biotechnology and clinical markets there was a decrease in demand from the life science research for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to the prior year within our chemical analysis business revenue grew 5 percent in 2014 compared with the prior year there was a strong increase in revenue from the food safety and forensics with environmental and petrochemical markets also showing increases at a more modest level when compared to the prior year within electronic measurement total revenue increased when compared to the prior year by 2 percent general purpose markets increased with computer and semiconductor markets improving but aerospace and defense was down when compared to 2013 also within electronic measurement the communications test business increased for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing growing strongly and rd showing a moderate shortfall compared to the prior year agilents net revenue of 6782 million decreased 1 percent in 2013 when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2012 revenue associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 

services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting services and other revenue increased 4 percent  in 2014  as compared to 2013  the service and other revenue growth is impacted by a portion of the revenue being driven by the current and previously installed produce base service and other revenue increased due to increased service contract renewals and laboratory productivity services but revenue from the sale of extended warranties within our electronic measurement business was flat due to the extension of standard terms from one year to three years in 2013 services and other revenue increased 4 percent  in 2013  as compared to 2012  

  

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

 on october 31 2014  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 430 million as compared to approximately 380 million at october 31 2013  within our life sciences and diagnostics business our unfilled backlog was approximately 530 million on october 31 2014  as compared to approximately 520 million at october 31 2013  

on october 31 2014  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 780 million as compared to approximately 760 million at october 31 2013  it is expected that the unfilled backlog will be fulfilled by keysight which separated from agilent on november 1 2014 

we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





in 2014 total gross margins decreased one percentage point when compared to the same period last year gross margins in our life sciences and diagnostics business were relatively flat up in our chemicals analysis business and down within our electronic measurement business for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to 2013 there were changes in gross margin due to higher inventory charges driven by the exit of the nmr business expenditures to address an fda warning letter increased warranty costs and product discounts offset by favorable manufacturing overhead costs operating margins declined by 2 percentage point in the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year the overall decline in operating margin for the year ended october 31 2014 was mostly due to preseparation costs operating margins within our life sciences and diagnostics business was down and in the chemical analysis business operating margins increased for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to 2013 within electronic measurement operating margins was flat for the year ended october 31 2014 when compared to 2013 

in 2013 total gross margin was flat in comparison to 2012 increased costs in particular intangible amortization from the acquisition of dako restructuring expenses and inventory charges were offset by a decrease in variable and incentive pay operating margins in 2013 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2012 as a result of increased operating expenses associated with the dako acquisition including increased intangible asset amortization restructuring costs higher wages and increased inventory charges offset by lower variable and incentive pay this was the result of maintaining cost control through a decrease in variable and incentive pay while absorbing increases in expenditure from dako and wage increases 

gross inventory charges were 79 million in 2014 48 million in 2013 and 30 million in 2012 sales of previously written down inventory were 9 million in 2014 7 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct five types of research and development basic research foundation technologies communications life sciences and measurement our research seeks to improve on various 

  

technical competencies in electronics photonics software systems and solutions and life sciences in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20000 products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

research and development expenditures increased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 rd expenditure increased within our life sciences and diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses with investments for product and software rd together with wage increases and higher variable pay within our electronic measurement business there was a reduction in rd expenditure within electronic measurement business due to savings from prior years restructuring research and development expenditures increased 5 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in new product development and technologies increased costs due to dako restructuring costs and wage increases partially offset by lower variable and incentive pay we remain committed to invest in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 selling general and administrative expenditure increased mostly due to preseparation costs with other increases in wages higher commissions and investments in sales channel coverage partially offset by an 11 million gain on sale of land and savings due to restructuring charges incurred in the prior year selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 increases were due to the acquisition of dako including amortization of intangible assets wage increases and investments in sales channel coverage in emerging geographies and restructuring costs offset by decreases in variable and incentive pay 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 113 million 107 million and 101 million respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts 

at october 31 2014 our headcount was approximately 21400 compared to 20600 in 2013 and 20500 in 2012 following the separation of keysight from agilent our headcount will be approximately 12000 

other income expense 

for the year ended october 31 2014 other income expense net includes a net loss on the early redemption of the 2015 senior notes and partial redemption of the 2017 notes of 89 million consisting of the prepayment penalties of 108 million 3 million of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and discount and the accelerated amortization of interest rate swap gains of 22 million 

income taxes 



for 2014 the effective tax rate was 22 percent the 22 percent effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory rates in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 76 million in 2014 in the fourth quarter we recorded an out of period tax expense of 13 million tax for corrections to us deferred taxes in the third quarter we recorded out of period adjustments consisting of a 9 million tax benefit related to the correction of the tax basis of land in the uk and a 3 million tax expense to correct tax related balance sheet accounts in the second quarter we recorded an out of period adjustment to tax expense of approximately 12 million for correction of transfer pricing for tax years 2012 and 2013 these corrections are not considered material to current or prior periods the effective tax rate increased by 6 percent over the previous year primarily due to lower earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed a lower statutory rates the out of period adjustments listed above and the impact of nondeductible costs related to the separation of keysight of 17 million 

  

for 2013 the effective tax rate was 16 percent the 16 percent effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory rates in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 127 million in 2013 the effective tax rate also included a 12 million outofperiod adjustment to increase tax expense recognized in the second quarter of 2013 associated with the write off of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits incorrectly claimed in prior years 

for 2012 the effective tax rate was a benefit of 11 percent the 11 percent effective tax rate benefit reflected tax on earnings in jurisdictions that had low effective tax rates and included a 280 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for most us federal and state deferred tax assets valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in the fourth quarter of 2012 management concluded that the valuation allowance for most of agilents us federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the return to sustainable us operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods as of october 31 2012 the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for agilents us consolidated income tax group will be realized accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring tax benefit of 280 million relating to the valuation allowance reversal the effective tax rate also included a nonrecurring tax expense of 88 million relating to an increase in the overall residual us tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested during the fourth quarter of 2012 we assessed the forecasted cash needs and overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas the effective tax rate was also reduced by a 68 million tax benefit primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions relating to foreign jurisdictions 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023 the keysight entity in singapore has not obtained a tax holiday to date accordingly income tax expense has been recorded on its fourth quarter earnings at the statutory rate as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 76 million 127 million and 122 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 023 037 and 035 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2008 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states on january 29 2014 we reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007 the settlement resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of 160 million offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately 148 million principally related to additional foreign earnings that were recognized in conjunction with the settlement agilents us federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2011 are currently under audit by the irs 

in connection with the settlement of the 20062007 irs audit we identified during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 an overstatement of approximately 65 million in our longterm tax liabilities the overstatement was recorded in 2008 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle when we adopted accounting standard codification 74010 income taxes accordingly we corrected the error by reducing longterm tax liabilities and increasing retained earnings by 65 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the correction had no impact on net income or cash flows in any prior period and is not considered material to total liabilities or equity in any prior period 

in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

  

segment overview 

through october 31 2014 we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and diagnostics business the chemical analysis business and the electronic measurement business 

life sciences and diagnostics 

our life sciences and diagnostics business provides applicationfocused solutions that include reagents instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level key product categories include liquid chromatography lc systems columns and components liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms systems laboratory software and informatics systems laboratory automation and robotic systems dissolution testing nucleic acid solutions nuclear magnetic resonance and xray diffraction systems services and support for the aforementioned products immunohistochemistry in situ hybridization hematoxylin and eosin staining special staining dna mutation detection genotyping gene copy number determination identification of gene rearrangements dna methylation profiling gene expression profiling next generation sequencing target enrichment and automated gel electrophoresisbased sample analysis systems we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics also called companion diagnostics with the potential of identifying patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy 

orders and net revenue 



life sciences and diagnostics orders in 2014 grew 5 percent compared to 2013 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on order growth when compared to the prior year order results were led by solid demand in the lc services and consumables portfolios along with strength in lcms nucleic acid genomics and informatics geographically orders grew 5 percent in the americas grew 9 percent in europe declined 9 percent in japan and grew 2 percent in asia pacific excluding japan during 2014 when compared to 2013 life sciences and diagnostics orders in 2013 increased 16 percent compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on order growth when compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the dako acquisition order growth of 4 percent in 2013 was driven by strength in lc genomics services and consumables partially offset by declines in lcms and research products 

life sciences and diagnostics net revenue in 2014 increased 3 percent compared to 2013 foreign currency movements for 2013 had a negligible impact on revenue growth when compared to the prior year revenue growth was led by strength in genomics lc consumables and services portfolios geographically revenue grew 3 percent in the americas grew 5 percent in europe declined 1 percent in japan and grew 3 percent in asia pacific excluding japan during 2014 when compared to 2013 the economic recovery and improved government spending continued to drive growth in the americas increased spending for life science research in china drove the moderate growth in asia pacific excluding japan while japan reflected the unfavorable impact of currency and lower government spending life sciences and diagnostics revenue in 2013 increased 16 percent compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2012 excluding the impact of the dako acquisition revenue growth of 3 percent was led by strength in lc consumables and services partially offset by declines in lcms and research products 

end market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2014 pharmaceutical and biotechnology market growth was driven by technology refreshes and continued specialty pharmaceutical demand despite budget restrictions in most pharmaceutical companies technology refresh programs in large and midsize pharmaceutical companies continue to drive traditional replacement business to move to the latest technologies in life science research improved government spending on 

  

capital equipment in the us china and europe in the second half of 2014 was not enough to offset the softness in research in the first half and in japan the first half of 2014 was impacted by slow releasing budgets particularly in the us and china the diagnostics and clinical market reflected solid demand for cgh microarray and target enrichment solutions and sustained growth in pathology applied markets grew moderately with good demand in forensics and food boosted by increased government spending in the us 

looking forward we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and diagnostics markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio we expect low spending levels to continue in life science research markets but we expect businesses such as consumables and services and the continued need to refresh instrumentation with high sensitivity and increased throughput to partially offset this effect we remain positive about our growth in our clinical and clinical research markets as adoption of our sureselect and haloplex sequencing target enrichment solutions continue we expect that there will be a positive impact of approximately 1 percentage point to operating margin in fiscal year 2015 as we complete the exit of our nmr business 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the life sciences and diagnostics business margins expenses and income from operations for 2014  versus 2013  and 2013  versus 2012  





gross margins in 2014 were relatively flat compared to 2013 gross margins reflect favorable product mix lower inventory charges entirely offset by costs to address the fda warning letter and higher infrastructure expenses and wage increases gross margins increased 1 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in gross margins was mainly due to the impact of the dako acquisition along with favorable volume and lower infrastructure expenses partially offset by unfavorable product mix 

research and development expenses increased 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 due to greater investments in software and next generation products higher infrastructure expenses wage increases and higher variable pay research and development expenses increased 17 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to the impact of the dako acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher commissions higher infrastructure expenses partially offset by workforce reductions selling general and administrative expenses increased 14 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to the impact of the dako acquisition 

operating margins decreased 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on higher revenue offset by increased operating expenses our nmr business which we made a decision to exit at the end of the fiscal year had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points on operating margin for fiscal year 2014    operating margins increased by 2 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012 the increases were mainly due to the impact of the dako acquisition and favorable gross profit from higher revenue 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2014 decreased by 1 million on a revenue increase of 72 million income from operations in 2013 increased by 82 million or 28 percent on a revenue increase of 316 million a 26 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental operating margin incremental is measured by the increase in income from operations compared to the prior period divided by the increase in revenue compared to the prior period 

  

chemical analysis 

our chemical analysis business provides applicationfocused solutions that include instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products key product categories in chemical analysis include gas chromatography gc systems columns and components gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms systems inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms instruments atomic absorption aa instruments inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes instruments molecular spectroscopy instruments software and data systems vacuum pumps and measurement technologies services and support for our products 

orders and net revenue 



chemical analysis orders in 2014 increased 6 percent when compared to 2013 foreign currency movements for 2014 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2013 order results showed positive performance in highend gas chromatographs spectroscopy instruments services and consumables strength in these areas was offset by declines in midrange micro gas chromatographs and vacuum products geographically orders grew 6 percent in the americas increased 9 percent in europe declined 1 percent in japan includes unfavorable currency impact of 11 percentage points and grew 6 percent in asia pacific excluding japan during 2014 when compared to 2013 in the americas the performance was primarily due to the improved demand from government as well as private sector in the second half of the year total asia pacific orders reflected continued weakness in japan orders offset by continued growth in both china and india chemical analysis orders in 2013 increased 2 percent compared to 2012 orders were led by positive growth in services consumables and icpms instruments which was partially offset by declines in gcms systems and flat orders in vacuum pump products 

chemical analysis revenue in 2014 increased 5 percent compared to 2013 foreign currency movements for 2014 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2013 revenue growth was led by strength in highend gc’s and aaoes instruments this was partially offset by weakness in micro midrange gc’s and vacuum products geographically revenue grew 4 percent in the americas grew 10 percent in europe grew 1 percent in japan including a 12 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and grew 3 percent in asia pacific excluding japan over 2013 chemical analysis revenue grew 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 revenue growth was led by services and consumables in the instruments gc and gcms weaknesses were offset by strength in icpms and aaoes 

chemical analysis saw positive growth in all the key end markets growth was led by food testing where the demand to export safe and high quality food in emerging markets remains strong and improved government funding in the americas and europe continue to drive strength for demand of spectroscopes and highend gas chromatograph instruments government spend in the developed countries has improved in the second half of the year and is driving the growth in forensics and environmental markets chemical and energy end markets saw low single digit growth in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by softness in the industrial markets in forensics the spread of designer drugs continues to drive the need for highsensitivity testing which is positively impacting the growth of gcms systems particularly in us and japan environmental and food testing demand grew due to an increased regulatory environment in china and other developing economies 

  

while the economic environment still remains uncertain the second half results of 2014 reflect a positive outlook for the chemical analysis core end markets we will continue to invest in research and development and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets new instrument launches over the next twelve months as well as continued market acceptance of our new products released in 2014 new 5100 icpoes 7010 gcms and 7200 gc qtof should help with our product differentiation and competitive position

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

  

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2014 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



we expect that with the separation of keysight from agilent on november 1 2014 that operating lease payments will be reduced by approximately 52 million in total for the periods presented we also expect the transfer of approximately one quarter of the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers and other purchase commitments to keysight at separation in addition our commitments under the retirement plans are expected to reduce by approximately 46 million with separation of keysight we do not expect a material adverse change in the effect these arrangements and obligations will have on our liquidity 

operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 53 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2014 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 15 million compared to 5 million as of october 31 2013 and 2012 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet the increase when compared to the previous year was largely due to the previous commitment undertaken with suppliers to the nmr business which we are exiting 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 127 million within the next year the increase in other purchase commitments compared with a year ago is partially due to additional contracts associated with our preseparation costs and the duplication of a number of contracts related to the separation activities of keysight 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2014 or october 31 2013 

  

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2014 related to our longterm debt and interest expense in millions 



in connection with the separation of keysight from agilent on november 1 2014 our obligations for longterm debt are expected to decrease by 1100 million and interest payments are expected to decrease by approximately 359 million 

other longterm liabilities include 289 million and 341 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 61 percent of our revenues in 2014  63 percent of our revenues in 2013  and 63 percent of our revenues in 2012  were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2014  and 2013 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations statement of comprehensive income or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2014  and 2013 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

we had approximately 14000 customers for electronic measurement products in fiscal 2013 and no single customer represented a material amount of the net revenue of the electronic measurement business 

in general the orders and revenues from many of the electronic measurement markets and product categories are seasonal 

  

traditionally marked by lower business levels in the first quarter of the fiscal year and higher volumes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year this seasonality is particularly evident in products that we sell into the aerospace and defense industry as well as those linked to consumer spending which includes some of our communications test equipment the seasonal impact of our business is tempered by broader economic trends and the diversity of our electronic measurement products and customers which span multiple industries 

electronic measurement sales marketing and support 

we have a focused sales strategy using a direct sales force resellers manufacturers representatives and distributors to meet our customers needs our direct sales force is focused on identifying customer needs and recommending solutions involving the effective use and deployment of our equipment services systems and capabilities some members of our direct sales force focus on global accounts providing uniform services on a worldwide basis others focus on our more complex products such as our highperformance instruments where customers require strategic consultation our sales force also engages with the contract manufacturer market by collaborating with original equipment manufacturers to specify our test equipment for contract manufacturer test applications as well as marketing to contract manufacturers directly

global infrastructure organization 

we provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization this support includes services in the areas of finance legal workplace services human resources and information technology generally these organizations are centrally operated from santa clara california with services provided worldwide as of the end of october 2013 our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2200 people worldwide 

agilent order fulfillment organization 

beginning in fiscal year 2012 we created the agilent order fulfillment organization to centralize all order fulfillment and supply organizations and operations aof leverages our strength in manufacturing engineering strategic sourcing and logistics for life sciences and diagnostics chemical analysis and electronic measurement businesses in general aof employees are dedicated to specific businesses and business headcount numbers include aof employees in the fourth quarter of 2013 we announced that the aof organization had been divided into two separate operations one dedicated to the life sciences diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses and one dedicated to the electronic measurement business 

  

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 704 million in 2013 668 million in 2012 and 649 million in 2011 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services we remain committed to invest approximately 10 percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

on october 31 2013  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 760 million as compared to approximately 800 million at october 31 2012  on october 31 2013  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 380 million as compared to approximately 360 million at october 31 2012  within our life sciences and diagnostics business our unfilled backlog was approximately 520 million on october 31 2013  as compared to approximately 530 million at october 31 2012  we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

  

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal our electronic measurement chemical analysis life sciences and diagnostics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company hewlettpackard company hp as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hp hp will have access to these properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located although hp has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the naming of agilent will not affect hps obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai 

  

or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2013 68 percent in fiscal 2012 and 70 percent in fiscal 2011 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 17 percent in fiscal 2013 and 16 percent in fiscal 2012 and 2011 approximately 9 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2013 10 percent in fiscal 2012 and 11 percent in fiscal 2011 was derived from japan revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 58 percent in fiscal year 2013 60 percent in fiscal year 2012 and 56 percent in fiscal year 2011 approximately 9 12 and 13 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition of material assets 

on june 21 2012 we acquired dako through the purchase of 100 of the share capital of dako a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of denmark under the share purchase agreement dated may 16 2012 dako provides antibodies reagents scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories as a result of the acquisition dako has become a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the consideration paid was approximately 2143 billion of which 14 billion was paid directly to the seller and 743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of dako agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

depressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us the continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

  

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions including declines related to the current market disruptions described above would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

we are pursuing a plan to spinoff our electronic measurement business into a new independent publicly traded company the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

i n september 2013 we announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies through a spinoff of our electronic measurement business unanticipated developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 

  

should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies see item 3 legal proceedings if government action results from our china investigation we could face possible fines and penalties criminal or civil sanctions or other consequences and our business could suffer 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

  

significant key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

certain significant key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we expect to be forced to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year for example in the past we completed various acquisitions including dako as halo genomics ab and the test systems division of at4 wireless as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts 

  

require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations further if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition and integration of dako as our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of dako in addition the operation of dako within agilent could be a costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

   

even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

 and 

 

as a result of these risks the dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation for instance danaher corporation completed its acquisition of iris international in november 2012 thermo fisher scientific announced its acquisition of life technologies in april 2013 and completed its acquisitions of doe  ingalls in may 2012 and one lambda in september 2012 and perkinelmer completed its acquisition of haoyuan biotech in november 2012 consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we develop configure and 

  

market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

some of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and medical devices and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business 

some of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the us that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must conform the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

a number of our products from our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting on march 4 2013 we made a report to the inspector general of the department of defense regarding pricing irregularities relating to certain sales of electronic measurement products to us government agencies see item 3 legal proceedings if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative 

  

functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

  

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

demand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies 

our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidation spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to our properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

we have agreed to indemnify hp for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hp to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict 

  

standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

on august 22 2012 the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the new rule which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31 2014 will require companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim 

  

of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

  

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

  

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 26 billion in senior unsecured notes and a 46 million secured mortgage we also are a party to a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in october 2016 and under which we may borrow up to 400 million and a danish krone denominated credit facility equivalent to 9 million we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

  

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

   

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

  

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 268 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including but not limited to patent commercial and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business there are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

on march 4 2013 we made a report to the inspector general of the department of defense “dod ig” regarding pricing irregularities relating to certain sales of electronic measurement products to us government agencies we have conducted a thorough investigation with the help of external counsel and we have approached the dod ig with a proposed methodology for resolving possible overcharges to us government purchasers resulting from these sales based on our investigation and our interactions with the dod ig we do not believe that this matter is reasonably possible of having a material impact on agilents financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of october 31 2013 we have accrued for this matter based on our current understanding 

as part of routine internal audit activities the company determined that certain employees of agilents subsidiaries in china did not comply with the companys standards of business conduct and other policies based on those findings the company has initiated an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel relating to certain sales of our products through third party intermediaries in china the internal investigation includes a review of compliance by our employees in china with the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations on september 5 2013 the company voluntarily contacted the united states securities and exchange commission and united states department of justice to advise both agencies of this internal investigation we will cooperate with any government investigation of this matter at this point we cannot predict or estimate the duration scope cost or result of this matter or whether the government will commence any legal action which could result in possible fines and penalties criminal or civil sanctions or other consequences accordingly no provision with respect to these matters has been made in the companys consolidated financial statements adverse findings or other negative outcomes from any governmental proceedings could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in future periods

overview and executive summary 

agilent technologies inc “we” “agilent” or the “company” incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is the worlds premier measurement company providing core bioanalytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences diagnostics and genomics chemical analysis communications and electronics industries our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

on september 19 2013 agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies one comprising of the life sciences diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that will retain the agilent name and the other that will be comprised of the electronic measurement business em the separation is expected to occur through a taxfree pro rata spin off of the em company to agilent shareholders and is expected to be completed early in november 2014 we expect to incur preseparation expenses of 100 million in fiscal 2014 

in addition to the announcement to separate into two companies we formed a new operating segment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 the new life sciences and diagnostics segment was formed by the combination of the life sciences business plus the diagnostics and genomics business following this reorganization agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and diagnostics business the chemical analysis business and the electronic measurement business the historical segment financial information for the life sciences and diagnostics segment has been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements 

on june 21 2012 we completed our acquisition of dako as through the acquisition of 100 of the share capital of dako as a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of denmark “dako” under the share purchase agreement dated may 16 2012 dako provides antibodies reagents scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories as a result of the acquisition dako became a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the consideration paid was approximately 2143 million of which 1400 million was paid directly to the seller and 743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of dako agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of dako are included in agilents consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the acquisition of dako and its portfolio is another step to increase our growth in several rapidly expanding areas of diagnostics including anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics as well as strengthen our existing offerings with a focus on product development to help in the fight against cancer for additional details related to the acquisition of dako see note 3 acquisitions 

agilents total orders in 2013 were 6827 million a decrease of 1 percent when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of total order growth for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 within our life sciences and diagnostics business orders increased 16 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 with 13 percentage points of order increase attributable to the dako acquisition chemical analysis orders increased 2 percent in 2013 when compared to 2012 and electronic measurement businesses orders decreased 13 percent when compared to 2012 agilents total orders in 2012 increased 2 percent when compared to 2011 the 

  

increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for 2 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 

agilents net revenue of 6782 million decreased 1 percent when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2012 revenue associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 within our life sciences and diagnostics business revenue increased 16 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 with 13 percentage points of revenue increase attributable to the dako acquisition excluding the effects of the dako acquisition there was growth in demand for life sciences and diagnostics products and services led by pharmaceutical and biotechnology and clinical markets there was a decrease in demand from the academic and government market for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to the prior year within our chemical analysis business revenue grew 2 percent in 2013 compared with the prior year there were modest increases in revenue from the food safety and petrochemical markets but environmental and forensics markets were down when compared to the prior year within electronic measurement total revenue decreased when compared to the prior year by 13 percent general purpose markets decreased with aerospace and defense flat and computer and semiconductor markets down when compared to 2012 also within electronic measurement the communications test business decreased for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to the prior year with wireless rd down moderately but wireless manufacturing showing a significant shortfall compared to the prior year mostly driven by the loss of business from a large customer with whom we could not agree on contractual terms agilents total net revenue in 2012 increased 4 percent when compared to 2011 the revenue increase associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2011 

net income was 724 million in 2013 compared to net income of 1153 million and 1012 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively in 2013 2012 and 2011 we generated operating cash flows of 1152 million 1228 million and 1260 million respectively as of october 31 2013 and 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2675 million and 2351 million respectively 

looking forward in the near term we are in a slowgrowth environment within electronic measurement which remains challenging there are indications that our electronic measurement business will return to a growth position next year we expect positive trends to continue in our other businesses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under 

  

software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the longterm performance program ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield on january 17 2012 the companys board of directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to the companys shareholders the fair value of all the awards granted prior to the declaration of quarterly cash dividend was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilents stock option over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 39 percent to 49 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 23 percent if no other factors were changed 

for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years for 2011 to 2013 we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants which we believe is representative of future behavior see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the 

  

impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2013 and 2012 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio and increased in 2013 from the previous year for 2013 and 2012 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and remained largely unchanged if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 8 million on us pension expense and 23 million on nonus pension expense lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 8 million on us pension expense and 17 million on nonus pension expense for 2013 actual return on assets was above expectations which along with contributions during the year reduced next year’s pension cost as well as improved the funded status at year end the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were 58 million in 2013 52 million in 2012 and 58 million in 2011 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets   agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination in the fourth quarter of 2013 we combined the life sciences and diagnostics and genomics segments to form the life sciences and diagnostics segment as a result agilent now has three segments life sciences and diagnostics chemical analysis and electronic measurement segments 

in september 2011 the fasb approved changes to the goodwill impairment guidance which are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test the changes provide entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the revised standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the revised guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required agilent opted to early adopt this guidance for the year ended october 31 2011 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

in fiscal year 2013 we assessed goodwill impairment for our four reporting units which consisted of two segments chemical analysis and electronic measurement and two reporting units under the life sciences and diagnostics segment the first of these two reporting units related to our life sciences business and the second related to our diagnostics business we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the following three reporting units as of september 30 2013 the chemical analysis 

  

segment the electronic measurement segment and the reporting unit relating to life sciences based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values we performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the reporting unit related to our diagnostics business as of september 30 2013 based on the results of our quantitative testing the fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2013 2012 and 2011 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

in july 2012 the fasb simplified the guidance for testing for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill the changes are intended to reduce compliance costs agilents indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets the revised guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not meaning a likelihood of more than 50 percent that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption was permitted agilent adopted this guidance for the year ended october 31 2012 based on the quantitative test we recorded an impairment of 1 million in 2013 and an impairment of 1 million in 2012 both relating to iprd projects that were abandoned in all other instances we used the qualitative test and concluded that it was more likely than not that all other indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired no impairments were recorded in 2011 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of longlived assets including purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets in 2013 we recorded 1 million of impairments of other intangibles related to cancellation of an inprocess research and development project we also recorded 3 million of impairments related to other longlived assets in 2013 in 2012 we recorded 1 million of impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of an inprocess research and development project we also recorded 1 of impairments related to other longlived assets in 2012 we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2011 and recorded 3 million of impairment charges primarily related to a business where we ceased operations we also recorded 8 million of impairments related to other longlived assets in 2011 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable that the employees are entitled to the severance and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our us deferred tax assets at october 31 2013 we continue to recognize 

  

a valuation allowance for certain us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring 

  

in the second quarter of 2013 we accrued for a targeted restructuring program that is expected to reduce agilents total headcount by approximately 450 regular employees representing approximately 2 percent of our global workforce the timing and scope of workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements when completed the restructuring program is expected to result in an approximately 50 million reduction in annual cost of sales and operating expenses in addition we have been streamlining our manufacturing operations as part of this action we anticipate the reduction of approximately 250 positions to reduce our annual cost of sales 

for the year ended october 31 2013 we accrued 53 million associated with the headcount reductions within the us we have substantially completed these restructuring activities internationally we expect to complete the majority of these restructuring activities by the end of the second half of fiscal 2014 as of october 31 2013 approximately 250 employees were terminated and 29 million was paid under the targeted restructuring program and 100 employees were terminated under the streamlining of manufacturing 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

  

results from operations 

orders and net revenue 



  



in general recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months agilents total orders in 2013 were 6827 million a decrease of 1 percent when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of total order growth for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 within our life sciences and diagnostics business orders increased 16 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 with 13 percentage points of order increase attributable to the dako acquisition chemical analysis orders increased 2 percent in 2013 when compared to 2012 and electronic measurement businesses orders decreased 13 percent when compared to 2012 agilents total orders in 2012 increased 2 percent when compared to 2011 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for 2 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 within our life sciences and diagnostics business orders increased due to the dako acquisition and were flat in chemical analysis and electronic measurement when compared to 2011 

agilents net revenue of 6782 million decreased 1 percent when compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2012 revenue associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to 2012 within our life sciences and diagnostics business revenue increased 16 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 with 13 percentage points of revenue increase attributable to the dako acquisition excluding the effects of the dako acquisition there was growth in demand for life sciences and diagnostics products and services led by pharmaceutical and biotechnology and clinical markets there was a decrease in demand from the academic and government market for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to the prior year within our chemical analysis business revenue grew 2 percent in 2013 compared with the prior year there were modest increases in revenue from the food safety and petrochemical markets but environmental and forensics markets were down when compared to the prior year within electronic measurement total revenue decreased when compared to the prior year by 13 percent general purposes markets decreased with aerospace and defense flat and computer and semiconductor markets down when compared to 2012 also within electronic measurement the communications test business decreased for the year ended october 31 2013 when compared to the prior year with wireless rd down moderately but wireless manufacturing showing a significant shortfall compared to the prior year mostly driven by the loss of business from a large customer with whom we could not agree on contractual terms agilents total net revenue in 2012 increased 4 percent when compared to 2011 the revenue increase associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2011 note 21 segment information shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue 

  

services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting services and other revenue increased 4 percent  in 2013  as compared to 2012  the service and other revenue growth is higher than product revenue growth due to a portion of the revenue being driven more by the previously installed base than current period product sales services and other revenue increased 6 percent  in 2012  as compared to 2011  

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

on october 31 2013  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 760 million as compared to approximately 800 million at october 31 2012  on october 31 2013  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 380 million as compared to approximately 360 million at october 31 2012  within our life sciences and diagnostics business our unfilled backlog was approximately 520 million on october 31 2013  as compared to approximately 530 million at october 31 2012  we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





in 2013 total gross margin was flat in comparison to 2012 increased costs in particular intangible amortization from the acquisition of dako restructuring expenses and inventory charges were offset by a decrease in variable and incentive pay in 2012 total gross margin decreased 1 percentage point in comparison to 2011 the unfavorable impact of product mix increased intangible amortization related to the dako acquisition were offset by lower variable and incentive pay operating margins in 2013 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2012 as a result of increased operating expenses associated with the dako acquisition including increased intangible asset amortization restructuring costs higher wages and increased inventory charges offset by lower variable and incentive pay operating margins in 2012 were flat when compared to 2011 this was the result of maintaining cost control through a decrease in variable and incentive pay while absorbing increases in expenditure from dako and wage increases 

gross inventory charges were 48 million in 2013 and 30 million in 2012 and 2011 sales of previously written down inventory were 7 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012 and 2011 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct five types of research and development basic research foundation technologies communications life sciences and measurement our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solutions life sciences and photonics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20000 products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

  

research and development expenditures increased 5 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in new product development and technologies increased costs due to dako restructuring costs and wage increases partially offset by lower variable and incentive pay research and development expenditures increased 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 increased expenditure was due to increased costs due to dako offset by lower variable and incentive pay we remain committed to invest approximately 10 percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 increases were due to the acquisition of dako including amortization of intangible assets wage increases and investments in sales channel coverage in emerging geographies and restructuring costs offset by decreases in variable and incentive pay selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2012 when compared to 2011 increases were due to the acquisition of dako wage increases and investments in sales channel coverage offset by decreases in variable and incentive pay and lower commissions 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 107 million 101 million and 86 million respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts 

at october 31 2013 our headcount was approximately 20600 compared to 20500 in 2012 and 18700 in 2011 a significant proportion of the increase in headcount in 2012 compared with 2011 was due to the dako acquisition 

income taxes 



for 2013 the effective tax rate was 16 percent the 16 percent effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory rates in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays the effective tax rate also included a 12 million outofperiod adjustment to increase tax expense recognized in the second quarter of 2013 associated with the write off of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits incorrectly claimed in prior years 

for 2012 the effective tax rate was a benefit of 11 percent the 11 percent effective tax rate benefit reflected tax on earnings in jurisdictions that had low effective tax rates and included a 280 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for most us federal and state deferred tax assets valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in the fourth quarter of 2012 management concluded that the valuation allowance for most of agilents us federal and state deferred tax assets is no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the return to sustainable us operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods as of october 31 2012 the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for agilents us consolidated income tax group will be realized accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring tax benefit of 280 million relating to the valuation allowance reversal the effective tax rate also included a nonrecurring tax expense of 88 million relating to an increase in the overall residual us tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested during the fourth quarter of 2012 we assessed the forecasted cash needs and overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas the effective tax rate was also reduced by a 68 million tax benefit primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions relating to foreign jurisdictions 

for 2011 the effective tax rate was 2 percent the 2 percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that had low effective tax rates and includes a 97 million net tax benefit primarily associated with a refund in canada and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions the income tax provision also included a 26 million out of period adjustment to reduce the carrying value of certain uk deferred tax assets for which the majority was recorded in the quarter ended april 30 2011 the overstatement of these deferred tax assets resulted in an overstatement of the uk valuation allowance release in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the full 

  

year this out of period adjustment was substantially offset by other out of period adjustments the net impact of all out of period adjustments on the effective tax rate was immaterial without considering interest and penalties the effective rate reflected taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continued to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 127 million 122 million and 127 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 037 035 and 036 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2006 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states agilents us federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2007 are currently under audit by the irs during the three months ended july 31 2012 the company received a revenue agents report “rar” for these years and filed a protest to dispute certain adjustments the most significant of which pertains to the amount of a gain from the disposition of a business that was allocated to the us for income tax purposes there can be no assurance that the outcome of this dispute will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

segment overview 

we formed a new operating segment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 the new life sciences and diagnostics segment was formed by the combination of the life sciences business plus the diagnostics and genomics business following this reorganization we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and diagnostics business the chemical analysis business and the electronic measurement business the historical segment financial information for the life sciences and diagnostics segment has been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements 

life sciences and diagnostics 

our life sciences and diagnostics business provides applicationfocused solutions that include reagents instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level key product categories include liquid chromatography lc systems columns and components liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms systems laboratory software and informatics systems laboratory automation and robotic systems dissolution testing nucleic acid solutions nuclear magnetic resonance magnetic resonance imaging and xray diffraction systems services and support for the aforementioned products immunohistochemistry in situ hybridization hematoxylin and eosin staining special staining dna mutation detection genotyping gene copy number determination identification of gene rearrangements dna methylation profiling gene expression profiling next generation sequencing target enrichment and automated gel electrophoresisbased sample analysis systems we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics also called companion diagnostics with the potential of identifying patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy 

  

orders and net revenue 



life sciences and diagnostics orders in 2013 grew 16 percent compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage point on order growth when compared to the prior year incremental orders associated with the dako acquisition in 2013 accounted for 13 percentage points of the order growth excluding the impact of the dako acquisition order results were led by demand in the lc genomics services and consumables portfolios geographically orders grew 16 percent in the americas grew 27 percent in europe declined 2 percent in japan and grew 9 percent in other asia pacific during 2013 when compared to 2012 life sciences and diagnostics orders in 2012 increased 6 percent compared to 2011 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on order growth when compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the dako acquisition order growth was driven by strength in informatics microfluidics nucleic acid and services budget constraints and cautious spending weighed on the results in 2012 

life sciences and diagnostics net revenue in 2013 increased 16 percent compared to 2012 revenue associated with the dako acquisition accounted for 17 percent of our life sciences and diagnostics business and 13 percentage points of the revenue growth in 2013 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2012 excluding the impact of the dako acquisition revenue growth was led by strength in lc consumables and services portfolios geographically revenue grew 13 percent in the americas grew 26 percent in europe declined 2 percent in japan and grew 12 percent in other asia pacific during 2013 when compared to 2012 though european countries continue to focus on addressing the financial downturn and continued austerity measures europe had the strongest performance with particular demand in the diagnostics and pharma markets life sciences and diagnostics revenue in 2012 increased 11 percent compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points compared to 2011 excluding the impact of the dako acquisition revenue strength was led by lcms informatics automation and services 

end market performance reflected slow growth across most markets in 2013 pharmaceutical and biotech market was soft overall as budgets continued to be tightened customers are investing to upgrade technology such as advanced lcms applications to stay ahead of the curve in biologic drugs yet still maintain an edge in chemical drugs particularly in generic drugs and emerging markets the academia and government market continued to see the dampening effects of the us sequestration and weak macroeconomic environment in europe though we saw some signs of stabilization in europe in the latter part of the 2013 the diagnostics market experienced solid growth in pathology reagent partnerships and companion diagnostics and the clinical market remained robust during the year reflecting record volumes in the latter part of 2013 for our genomics products applied markets were flat as growth in food and petrochemical saw good demand from china and other emerging markets but was largely offset by declines in environmental and forensics markets as tight government budgets continued to constrain demand in the us and europe 

looking forward we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and diagnostics markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio we expect low spending levels to continue in academic and government markets given the us budget sequestration and continued austerity in most developed countries but we expect businesses such as consumables and services and the continued need to refresh aging instrumentation to partially offset this effect we remain positive about our growth in our clinical and clinical research markets as adoption of our sureselect and haloplex sequencing target enrichment solutions continue the fourth quarter of 2013 marked the commercial launch of the new dako omnis autostainer first installations of this platform have taken place and we are seeing good acceptance of orders in both the us and europe

orders and net revenue 



chemical analysis orders in 2013 increased 2 percent compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage point compared to 2012 order results were led by solid performance in services consumables and icpms instruments strength in these areas was offset by declines in gcms systems and flat orders in vacuum pump products geographically orders were flat in the americas increased 5 percent in europe declined 14 percent in japan includes unfavorable currency impact of 16 percentage points and grew 6 percent in other asia pacific during 2013 when compared to 2012 in the americas the overall government spending remains weak total asia pacific orders reflected continued weakness in unfavorable currency impacts in japan orders offset by continued growth in both china and south asia pacific and korea chemical analysis orders in 2012 increased 1 percent compared to 2011 due to strength in services and consumables along with gcms and icpms instruments 

chemical analysis net revenue in 2013 increased 2 percent compared to 2012 foreign currency movements for 2013 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage point compared to 2012 revenue growth was led by services and consumables gc and gcms weaknesses were offset by strength in icpms and aa and icpoes instruments geographically revenue grew 3 percent in the americas grew 1 percent in europe declined 17 percent in japan including a 15 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and grew 8 percent in other asia pacific brazil china and india in particular had strong revenue growth in 2013 each having double digit growth chemical analysis revenue grew 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 led by services and consumables along with strength in icpms 

chemical analysis saw mixed growth in the core end markets the demand to export safe and high quality food in emerging markets remains strong and their government funding continues to drive strength for purchases of gc and gcms instruments chemical and energy end markets saw modest increases in 2013 compared to 2012 driven primarily by stronger demand in china and a bright outlook for petrochemicals in north america in forensics the spread of designer drugs continues to drive the need for gcms systems particularly in europe environmental demand in mature markets is tempered by continued government budget constraints in emerging economies testing to ensure the quality and safety of drinking water is a factor in economic growth and has led to the demand for gcms and icpms instruments other applied markets showed midsingle digit growth with growth in pharmaceutical and bio tech markets being offset by a decline in academic and government markets 

strength in 2013 and our fourth quarter results reflect a positive outlook for the chemical analysis core end markets we will continue to invest in research and development and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets new instrument launches over the next twelve months as well as continued market acceptance of our new products released in 2013 will help with our product differentiation and competitive position 

  

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the chemical analysis businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2013  versus 2012  and 2012  versus 2011  





gross margins in 2013 remained flat compared to 2012 higher product discounts and unfavorable foreign currency movements were offset by favorable manufacturing overhead costs and favorable revenue volume gross margin also remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by higher product discounts offsetting favorable revenue volume and lower material costs 

research and development expenses increased 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 driven mainly by our continued investment in instrument products research and development expenses remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher infrastructure expenses and commissions partially offset by reduced discretionary expenses including marketing programs and travel selling general and administrative expenses remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by investments in sales channel coverage with a focus on emerging markets being offset by lower commissions and discretionary spending 

operating margins increased by 1 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was mainly due to favorable gross profit from higher revenue while holding expenses fairly flat operating margins increased 1 percentage point from 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to favorable gross profit from higher revenue while holding expenses flat 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2013 increased by 17 million or 5 percent on a revenue increase of 35 million a 49 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental income from operations in 2012 increased by 25 million or 8 percent compared to 2011 on a revenue increase of 41 million or 60 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental

orders and net revenue 



electronic measurement orders declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on the yearoveryear compare orders were lower for all market segments including aerospace and defense industrial computer and semiconductor test and communications test which decreased yearoveryear primarily due to lower wireless manufacturing demand relating to the loss of business from a large customer with whom we could not agree on contractual terms on a geographic basis orders declined 20 percent in the americas 12 percent in japan 7 percent in asia pacific excluding japan and 4 percent in europe the decline in orders in the americas was driven by weak communications test and soft aerospace and defense demand japan orders were lower due to the unfavorable impact of currency movements improving by 1 percent yearoveryear in local currency electronic measurement orders declined 1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 weak industrial and slightly lower aerospace and defense orders were mostly offset by growth in computer and semiconductor and communications test business 

  

electronic measurement revenue declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily on lower wireless manufacturing and industrial computer and semiconductor test demand the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements contributed to 2 percentage points of the yearoveryear decline revenue from the americas decreased 19 percent on significantly lower wireless manufacturing demand and soft general purpose test business japan revenue was 14 percent lower yearoveryear but declined only 3 percent in local currency asia pacific excluding japan decreased 7 percent and europe declined 6 percent when compared to last year revenue from products was 15 percent lower compared to 2012 while service related revenue was flat electronic measurement revenue was flat in 2012 compared to 2011 on flat demand in both general purpose and communications test within communications test strong wireless manufacturing test revenue was offset by lower wireless rd and broadband communications test business 

general purpose test revenue representing approximately 66 percent of electronic measurement business declined yearoveryear on weak industrial computer and semiconductor test demand our aerospace and defense business was flat yearoveryear on lower demand in the americas offset by stronger spending in europe semiconductor test revenue declined on moderating investments in new process technology and weak manufacturing demand the shift from personal computers to lower priced more highly integrated tablets has resulted in a reduction in test equipment demand uncertain global economic conditions contributed to lower industrial test business in 2012 general purpose test represented approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue with slight growth in computers and semiconductor business flat industrial test demand and a slight decline in aerospace and defense compared to 2011 

communications test revenue representing approximately 34 percent of total electronic measurement declined yearoveryear primarily due to significantly lower wireless manufacturing demand driven by the loss of business from a large customer with whom we could not agree on contractual terms wireless rd spending remained soft reflecting a cautious spending environment though longterm industry fundamentals remain intact with continued interest in high data rate applications such as longterm evolution lte in 2012 communications test represented approximately 37 percent of total electronic measurement revenue strong wireless manufacturing test demand was offset by lower wireless rd and broadband communications business 

the outlook across market segments remains mixed there continues to be downward pressure on aerospace and defense demand with nearterm uncertainty relating to the budget for the united states we expect to see improvement in semiconductor test considering the order strength in the last quarter of fiscal year 2013 communications test is expected to improve in the near term on investment in wireless rd for next generation formats and more stable wireless manufacturing demand longer term growth drivers such as mobility and transformational initiatives including modular and handheld instrumentation support our ongoing investments

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

  

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2013 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 55 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2013 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 5 million compared to 5 million as of october 31 2012 and 2011 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 70 million within the next year 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2013 or october 31 2012 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our longterm debt as of october 31 2013 in millions 



we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts interest rates and payment dates are detailed in 

  

longterm debt 

other longterm liabilities include 341 million and 320 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2013  63 percent of our revenues in 2012  and 64 percent of our revenues in 2011  were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2013  and 2012 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2013  and 2012 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

diagnostics and genomics markets 

our diagnostics and genomics business focuses primarily on the following three markets 

the clinical market  a significant part of our clinical diagnostic customers are in pathology labs throughout the world our highquality automated pathology tissue staining platforms and solutions are used most heavily by the large labs located in hospitals medical centers and reference labs the market is skewed towards the mature economies with approximately 75 of the market in north america western europe and japan the mix is changing however as emerging markets increase spending on human health    

the clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing including “forprofit” reference laboratories hospital labs and molecular diagnostic companies while these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics “ivd” labeled testing kits they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests analyte specific reagents “asrs” are often used by these labs 

the academic and government market  this market consists primarily of “notforprofit” organizations and includes academic institutions large government institutions and privately funded organizations the academic and government research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for pharmabiotech and clinical laboratories as such there is heavy emphasis on human disease research 

the pharma biotech  cro market   this market consists of “forprofit” companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research discovery and development and clinical trials there has been much activity in this market space where most large pharma companies have acquired a biopharma arm enabling development of therapeutics based on both small molecules classic pharmaceuticals and large molecules protein antibody based due to the relative low drug efficacy within oncology pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated test to the market with their new drugs additionally pharma companies are more often outsourcing clinical trial work to cros making them a growing portion of this market segment 

diagnostics and genomics products and applications 

  

our products fall into seven main areas of work pathology products specific proteins and flow reagents target enrichment cytogenetic research solutions microarrays nucleic acid quality control and molecular biology products 

pathology products 

this area consists of routine clinical solutions for tissue based cancer diagnostics with solutions that comprise antibodies reagents instruments and software targeting both primary and advanced cancer diagnostics our coverstainer and artisan based product families target primary cancer diagnostics through hematoxylin and eosin “he” staining as well as special stains for additional insights and detection of potentially carcinogenic infections our autostainer based ihc solution and instant quality fluorescence in situ hybridization iqfish technologies provide advanced tumor typing through investigation of protein and gene expression this also includes so called companion diagnostic tests that are used to help identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy 

specific proteins and flow reagents

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 668 million in 2012 649 million in 2011 and 612 million in 2010 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods 

that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers backlog amounts have been restated for the year ended october 31 2011 to conform to this definition 

on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 800 million as compared to approximately 850 million at october 31 2011  on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 360 million as compared to approximately 320 million at october 31 2011  within our life sciences business our unfilled backlog was approximately 500 million on october 31 2012  as compared to approximately 490 million at october 31 2011  on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the diagnostics and genomics business was approximately 30 million as compared to approximately 30 million at october 31 2011  we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all four businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal our electronic measurement chemical analysis life sciences and diagnostics and genomics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company hewlettpackard company hp as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hp hp will have access to these properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which 

the property is located although hp has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the naming of agilent will not affect hps obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 68 percent in fiscal 2012 70 percent in fiscal 2011 and 68 percent in fiscal 2010 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 14 percent in fiscal 2010 approximately 10 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2012 11 percent in fiscal 2011 and 10 percent in fiscal 2010 was derived from japan revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 60 percent in fiscal year 2012 56 percent in fiscal year 2011 and 52 percent in fiscal year 2010 approximately 12 13 and 13 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant 

manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition of material assets 

on june 21 2012 we acquired dako through the purchase of 100 of the share capital of dako a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of denmark under the share purchase agreement dated may 16 2012 dako provides antibodies reagents scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories as a result of the acquisition dako has become a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the consideration paid was approximately 2143 billion of which 14 billion was paid directly to the seller and 743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of dako agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

depressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions including declines related to the current market disruptions described above would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative 

functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted 

  

although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 21 

 

we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year for example during fiscal 2010 we closed our acquisition of varian inc and the sale of our network solutions division during fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisitions of a2 technologies lab901 and biocius life sciences inc during fiscal 2012 we completed various acquisitions including dako as biosystem development llc halo genomics ab the test systems division of at4 wireless and the test and measurement businesses of centellax inc as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively 

prevent fraud the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to 

 

in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations further if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of dako as our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of dako in addition the operation of dako within agilent could be a costly and timeconsuming process that involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

   

even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

 and 

 

as a result of these risks the dako acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation for instance danaher corporation completed its acquisitions of beckman coulter inc in june 2011 and iris 

international in november 2012 thermo fisher scientific completed its acquisitions of phadia in august 2011 doe  ingalls in may 2012 and one lambda in september 2012 and perkinelmer completed its acquisitions of haoyuan biotech in november 2012 and caliper life sciences in november 2011 consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to our properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

we have agreed to indemnify hp for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hp to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations 

could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

some of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marked by our chemical analysis and life sciences businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the us that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances we must conform the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

a number of our products from our life sciences chemical analysis and diagnostics and genomics businesses are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies as such we continually invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to gain and maintain certifications necessary for the level of clearance our pathology manufacturing facilities in denmark and california have established quality management systems and manufacturing practices designed to comply with the adequate standards for the in vitro diagnostics industry including iso 13485 medical devices and fda 21cfr part 820 quality system regulation as well as additional international standards our genomics cedar creek texas manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturing facility this fda registered facility is the site where our class i asr surefish products are manufactured additionally other facilities maintain iso 13485 manufacturing compliance if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents 

or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations including our senior notes coming due in july 2013 our stock repurchase program our declared dividends and 

acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through 1 the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or 2 other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

  

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 225 billion in senior unsecured notes and a 44 million secured mortgage we also are a party to a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in october 2016 and under which we may borrow up to 400 million and a danish krone denominated credit facility equivalent to 9 million we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

  

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

  

   

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in

overview and executive summary 

agilent is the worlds premier measurement company providing core bioanalytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences chemical analysis diagnostics and genomics communications and electronics industries our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

agilents total orders in 2012 were 6877 million an increase of 2 percent when compared to 2011 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for 2 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 within each of our life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement businesses orders were flat when compared to the prior year orders within our diagnostics and genomics business increased 44 percent when compared to last year and was attributable to the dako acquisition agilents total orders in 2011 increased 18 percent when compared to 2010 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our divested businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 

agilents net revenue of 6858 million increased 4 percent when compared to 2011 the revenue increase associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of approximately1 percentage point compared to 2011 there was modest growth in demand for life sciences products led by an increase in revenue from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market but there was also a corresponding decrease in revenue from the academic and government market for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to the prior year within our chemical analysis business revenue grew moderately compared with the prior year there were modest increases in revenue from the food safety and forensics markets but environmental and petrochemical markets were relatively flat when compared to the prior year the diagnostics and genomics business growth compared to the prior year was attributable to the acquisition of dako within electronic measurement total revenue from general purpose markets was flat in 2012 when compared to the prior year with a modest shortfall in revenue from aerospace and defense offset by an increase in revenue from the computer and semiconductor market also within electronic measurement the communications test business was flat for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing reporting good revenue growth in the year offset by a decline in the revenue from the wireless rd market agilents total net revenue in 2011 increased 22 percent when compared to 2010 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 

net income was 1153 million in 2012 compared to net income of 1012 million and 684 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2012 2011 and 2010 we generated operating cash flows of 1228 million 1260 million and 718 million respectively as of october 31 2012 and 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 2351 million and 3527 million respectively 

on june 21 2012 we completed our acquisition of dako as through the acquisition of 100 of the share capital of dako as a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of denmark “dako” under the share purchase agreement dated may 16 2012 dako provides antibodies reagents scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories as a result of the acquisition dako became a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the consideration paid was approximately 2143 million of which 1400 million was paid directly to the seller and 743 million was paid to satisfy the 

outstanding debt of dako agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of dako are included in agilents consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the acquisition of dako and its portfolio is another step to increase our growth in several rapidly expanding areas of diagnostics including anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics as well as strengthen our existing offerings with a focus on product development to help in the fight against cancer for additional details related to the acquisition of dako see note 3 acquisitions 

looking forward we believe we have entered a slowgrowth environment where continued uncertainty will dampen demand for our products and services there are improvements to be achieved in operating performance by leveraging our value engineering purchase power logistics and manufacturing capabilities we also have a number of variable cost mechanisms that we are able to use moving forward we expect to continue to introduce innovative technologies and deliver marketleading products while we make progress in optimizing our order fulfillment and manufacturing operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which may result in changes in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield on january 17 2012 the companys board of directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to the companys shareholders the fair value of all the awards granted prior to the declaration of quarterly cash dividend was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 the espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilents stock option over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 38 percent to 48 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 23 percent if no other factors were changed 

in 2010 the expected life of our employee stock options was 44 years in the first quarter of 2011 we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 44 to 58 years for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants which we believe is representative of future behavior there was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in 2012 see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2012 and 2011 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio and decreased in 2012 from the previous year for 2012 and 2011 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using 

a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us pension expense and 17 million on nonus pension expense the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were 52 million in 2012 58 million in 2011 and 82 million in 2010 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets   agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination subsequent to october 31 2011 we formed a fourth segment diagnostics and genomics from a portion of our life sciences segment as a result agilent now has four segments life sciences chemical analysis diagnostics and genomics and electronic measurement which are the same as our reporting units 

in september 2011 the fasb approved changes to the goodwill impairment guidance which are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test the changes provide entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the revised standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the revised guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required agilent opted to early adopt this guidance for the year ended october 31 2011 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

in fiscal year 2012 we assessed goodwill impairment for our four reporting units life sciences chemical analysis diagnostics and genomics and electronic measurement based on our results of our qualitative test for goodwill impairment by reporting unit as of september 30 2012 we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each of our four reporting units life sciences chemical analysis diagnostics and genomics and electronic measurement is greater than their respective carrying values there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2012 2011 and 2010 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years inprocess research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

in july 2012 the fasb simplified the guidance for testing for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill the changes are intended to reduce compliance costs agilents indefinitelived intangible assets are in the iprd intangible assets the revised guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the recently issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to determine whether it is more likely than not meaning a likelihood of more than 50 percent that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value the amendments are effective for annual and 

interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted agilent adopted this guidance for the year ended october 31 2012 we recorded an impairment of 1 million in 2012 relating to an iprd project that was abandoned no impairments were recorded in 2011 and 2010 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of longlived assets including purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets in 2012 we recorded 1 million of impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of an inprocess research and development project we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2011 and recorded 3 million of impairment charges primarily related to a business where we ceased operations we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2010 and recorded 13 million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2012 we provided a valuation allowance for certain us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded that the valuation allowance for most of our us federal and state deferred tax assets is no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the return to sustainable us operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods as of october 31 2012 the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for agilents us consolidated income tax group will be realized accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring noncash tax benefit of 280 million relating to the valuation allowance reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring costs asset impairments and other charges 

our 2009 restructuring program the fy 2009 plan announced in the first half of 2009 was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle workforce reduction payments primarily severance were largely complete in fiscal year 2010 lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

results from operations 

orders and net revenue 



  



agilents total orders in 2012 were 6877 million an increase of 2 percent when compared to 2011 the increase in orders associated with the dako acquisition accounted for 2 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 within each of our life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement businesses orders were flat when compared to the prior year orders within our diagnostics and genomics business increased 44 percent when compared to last year and was attributable to the dako acquisition agilents total orders in 2011 increased 18 percent when compared to 2010 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our divested businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 

agilents net revenue of 6858 million increased 4 percent when compared to 2011 the revenue increase associated with the dako acquisition accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point 

compared to 2011 there was modest growth in demand for life sciences products led by an increase in revenue from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market but there was also a corresponding decrease in revenue from the academic and government market for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to the prior year within our chemical analysis business revenue grew moderately compared with the prior year there were modest increases in revenue from the food safety and forensics markets but environmental and petrochemical markets were relatively flat when compared to the prior year the diagnostics and genomics business growth compared to the prior year was attributable to the acquisition of dako within electronic measurement total revenue from general purpose markets was flat in 2012 when compared to the prior year with a modest shortfall in revenue from aerospace and defense offset by an increase in revenue from the computer and semiconductor market also within electronic measurement the communications test business was flat for the year ended october 31 2012 when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing reporting good revenue growth in the year offset by a decline in the revenue from the wireless rd market agilents total net revenue in 2011 increased 22 percent when compared to 2010 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 note 21 segment information shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue 

services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting services and other revenue increased 6 percent  in 2012  as compared to 2011  the service and other revenue growth is higher than product revenue growth due to a portion of the revenue being driven more by the previously installed base than current period product sales services and other revenue increased 16 percent  in 2011  as compared to 2010  the increase in services and other revenue associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue increase in 2011 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers backlog amounts have been restated for the year ended october 31 2011 to conform to this definition 

on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately 800 million as compared to approximately 850 million at october 31 2011  on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately 360 million as compared to approximately 320 million at october 31 2011  within our life sciences business our unfilled backlog was approximately 500 million on october 31 2012  as compared to approximately 490 million at october 31 2011  on october 31 2012  our unfilled backlog for the diagnostics and genomics business was approximately 30 million as compared to approximately 30 million at october 31 2011  we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all four businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenues we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





in 2012 total gross margin decreased 1 percentage point in comparison to 2011 the unfavorable impact of product mix increased intangible amortization and inventory fair value adjustments related to the dako acquisition were offset by lower variable and incentive pay in 2011 total gross margins decreased 1 percentage point in comparison to 2010 the unfavorable impact of the varian acquisition including fair value adjustments and higher variable and incentive pay were largely offset by the benefits of favorable volume impacts decreased business and infrastructure programs and lower restructuring costs operating margins in 

2012 were flat when compared to 2011 this was the result of maintaining cost control through a decrease in variable and incentive pay while absorbing increases in expenditure from acquisitions and wage increases operating margins in 2011 increased 6 percentage points as compared to 2010 due to higher volume partly offset by increased variable and incentive pay 

gross inventory charges were 30 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 sales of previously written down inventory were 5 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct five types of research and development basic research foundation technologies communications life sciences and measurement our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solutions life sciences and photonics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20000 products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest about 10 percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

research and development expenditures increased 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in new product development and technologies and increased costs due to acquisitions primarily dako offset by lower variable and incentive pay research and development expenditures increased 6 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 increases were due to new product development the varian acquisition and higher variable and incentive pay these increases were partly offset by the impact of the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses and decreased restructuring expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2012 when compared to 2011 increases were due to the acquisition of dako wage increases and investments in sales channel coverage offset by decreases in variable and incentive pay and lower commissions selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 increased expenditure was due to the varian acquisition and higher variable and incentive pay offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the costs associated with the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses 

for the year ended october 31 2010 we recorded a 132 million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and 54 million of other income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with hewlett packard company 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 101 million 86 million and 96 million respectively and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts 

at october 31 2012 our headcount was approximately 20500 compared to 18700 in 2011 and 18500 in 2010 a significant proportion of the increase in our headcount in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to the dako acquisition 

income taxes 



for 2012 the effective tax rate reflects a favorable benefit of 11 percent the 11 percent effective tax rate benefit reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates and includes a 280 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for most us federal and state deferred tax assets valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in the fourth quarter of 2012 management concluded that the valuation allowance for most of agilents us federal and state deferred tax assets is no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the return to sustainable us operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods as of october 31 2012 the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for agilents us consolidated income tax group will be realized accordingly we recognized a 

nonrecurring tax benefit of 280 million relating to the valuation allowance reversal the effective tax rate also includes a nonrecurring tax expense of 88 million relating to an increase in the overall residual us tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested during the fourth quarter of 2012 we assessed the forecasted cash needs and overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas the effective tax rate is also reduced by a 68 million tax benefit primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions relating to foreign jurisdictions 

for 2011 the effective tax rate was 2 percent the 2 percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that had low effective tax rates and includes a 97 million net tax benefit primarily associated with a refund in canada and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions the income tax provision also included a 26 million out of period adjustment to reduce the carrying value of certain uk deferred tax assets for which the majority was recorded in the quarter ended april 30 2011 the overstatement of these deferred tax assets resulted in an overstatement of the uk valuation allowance release in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the full year this out of period adjustment was substantially offset by other out of period adjustments the net impact of all out of period adjustments on the effective tax rate was immaterial without considering interest and penalties the effective rate reflected taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continued to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 

for 2010 the effective tax rate was 1 percent the 1 percent effective tax rate included a 101 million beneficial release of the uk valuation allowance a 32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that had low effective tax rates also included is a 17 million tax benefit related to a 54 million nontaxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard company without considering interest and penalties the effective rate reflected taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continued to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 122 million 127 million and 62 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 035 036 and 018 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

in the us tax years remain open back to the year 2006 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states in 2011 agilent and the internal revenue service “irs” reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 2003  2007 tax adjustments resulting from these agreements were offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards agilents us federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2007 are currently under audit by the irs during the three months ended july 31 2012 we received a revenue agents report “rar” for these years and filed a protest to dispute certain adjustments the most significant of which pertains to the amount of a gain from the disposition of a business that was allocated to the us for income tax purposes there can be no assurance that the outcome of this dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition in other major jurisdictions where we conduct business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the us it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

segment overview 

agilent is a measurement company providing core bioanalytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences chemical analysis communications and electronics diagnostics and genomics industries in the third fiscal quarter of 2012 we formed a new operating segment the new diagnostics and genomics segment was formed from a portion of our preexisting life 

sciences business plus the business of our recent acquisition of dako as dako following this reorganization agilent has four business segments comprised of the life sciences business the chemical analysis business diagnostics and genomics business and the electronic measurement business the historical segment numbers for both the life sciences and diagnostics and genomics segments have been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements 

life sciences 

our life sciences business provides applicationfocused solutions that include instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products key product categories in life sciences include liquid chromatography lc systems columns and components liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms systems laboratory software and informatics systems laboratory automation and robotic systems dissolution testing nucleic acid solutions nuclear magnetic resonance nmr magnetic resonance imaging mri and xray diffraction “xrd” systems and services and support for the aforementioned products 

orders and net revenue 



life sciences orders in 2012 were flat compared to 2011 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage point on order growth when compared to the prior year order results were led by demand in the informatics automation nucleic acid and services portfolios geographically orders grew 6 percent in the americas declined 10 percent in europe grew 19 percent in japan and were flat in other asia pacific during 2012 when compared to 2011 budget constraints and cautious spending weighed on the results in europe life sciences orders in 2011 increased 25 percent compared to 2010 driven by strength in the lcms automation and informatics portfolios along with consumables and services excluding the impact of the varian and biocius acquisitions and the hycor divestiture orders grew 13 percent year over year 

life sciences net revenue in 2012 increased 4 percent compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points compared to 2011 revenue growth was led by strength in the lcms informatics automation nucleic acid solutions and services portfolios services business was strong due to demand for service contracts maintenance and multivendor services geographically revenue grew 6 percent in the americas 1 percent in europe 4 percent in japan and 7 percent in other asia pacific during 2012 when compared to 2011 life sciences revenue in 2011 increased 24 percent compared to 2010 with growth in the americas helped by an expanded sales channel selling a broader portfolio of products to our customers excluding the impact of the varian and biocius acquisitions and the hycor divestiture revenue grew 13 percent year over year 

during this fiscal year revenue grew in the pharmaceutical and biotech markets food testing and all other applied markets including forensics petrochemical and environmental despite tightening of budgets growth in the pharmaceutical market was driven by technology refresh programs leading to replacement business quality assurance and quality control the food market saw moderate growth as global food regulations continue to drive demand lcms food testing was driven by the continued uptake of metabolomics lcms quadrupole timeofflight qtof based solutions in the food industry and improved software analysis tools applied markets also grew from last year with forensics petrochemical and environmental applications all making moderate gains the academia and government market was rather weak reflecting the macroeconomic environment 

the overall macroeconomic weakness has affected demand for our instruments and application solutions and we expect that to continue at the start of the next fiscal year despite this weakness we continue to invest in expanding and improving our life sciences applications and solutions portfolio our new products released during the year such as the 1290 infinity quaternary lc system continue our technology leadership in the lc market by setting new benchmarks for performance versatility and costofownership in addition we continue to focus on applicationspecific solutions in emerging countries and markets 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the life sciences business margins expenses and income from operations for 2012  versus 2011  and 2011  versus 2010  





gross margins in 2012 remained flat compared to 2011 favorable revenue volume and lower material costs were offset by higher infrastructure costs and unfavorable product mix gross margins declined by 2 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to the impact of the varian portfolio which has lower gross margins higher logistics costs and higher consumables costs partially offset by favorable volume impact 

research and development expenses increased 5 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was mainly due to continued investment in new products and technologies research and development expenses increased 29 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 mostly due to our varian and biocius acquisitions and investments in new product development 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was due to investments in sales channel coverage with a focus on emerging markets partially offset by lower commissions and discretionary spending selling general and administrative expenses increased 28 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was due to acquisitions varian and biocius higher commissions and investments in sales channel coverage 

operating margins increased by 1 percentage point in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was mainly due to favorable gross profit from higher revenue outpacing operating expense growth operating margins declined by 3 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 as the operating expense growth slightly outpaced the increased gross profit 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2012 increased by 28 million or 14 percent on a revenue increase of 67 million a 41 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental income from operations in 2011 decreased by 1 million or 1 percent despite a revenue increase of 289 million operating margin incremental is measured by the increase in income from operations compared to the prior period divided by the increase in revenue compared to the prior period

our chemical analysis business provides applicationfocused solutions that include instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products key product categories in chemical analysis include gas chromatography gc systems columns and components gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms systems inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms instruments atomic absorption aa instruments inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes instruments molecular spectroscopy instruments software and data systems vacuum pumps and measurement technologies services and support for our products 

orders and net revenue 



chemical analysis orders in 2012 increased 1 percent compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2011 order results were led by solid performance in services and consumables along with gcms and icpms instruments service orders were led by strength in contracts and lab management services icpms orders were led by our 7700 series icpms and 8800 icpms triple quadrupole icpqqq growth was largely offset by declines in gc instruments and the vacuum pump portfolio geographically orders grew 5 percent in the americas declined 5 percent in europe declined 4 percent in japan and grew 4 percent in other asia pacific during 2012 when compared to 2011 europe was negatively impacted by the budget constraints and cautious spending chemical analysis orders in 2011 increased 30 percent compared to 2010 driven by strength in the gc gcms icpms portfolios along with consumables and services excluding the impact of the varian and a2 technologies acquisitions orders grew 11 percent year over year 

chemical analysis net revenue in 2012 increased 3 percent compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points compared to 2011 revenue growth was led by services and consumables along with the strength in icpms instruments however we continue to face challenges in the vacuum pump portfolio as weakness in semiconductor and industrial markets affected results geographically revenue grew 2 percent in the americas declined 1 percent in europe declined 2 percent in japan and grew 8 percent in other asia pacific during 2012 when compared to 2011 many us government purchases have been slowed or put on hold due to continued weakness at the federal state and local levels which slowed growth in the americas other asia pacific was a bright spot boosted by a strong finish in china during the last quarter chemical analysis revenue in 2011 increased 27 percent compared to 2010 with particularly strong growth in other asia pacific including china excluding the impact of the varian and a2 technologies acquisitions revenues grew 8 percent year over year 

growth was mixed in core end markets the worldwide food market remains strong in all sectors and demand to export safe and high quality food in the emerging markets remains robust the food safety segment continues to drive increased testing capacity and instrument purchases in all product categories consumables and services forensics market growth was encouraging particularly in developing countries increasing demand for screening and identification of abused prescription pharmaceuticals and designer drugs is driving purchasing of new high resolution mass spectrometry technologies environmental has softened as government budget constraints impacted demand petrochemical market results were relatively flat weak industrial demand in chemical and energy end markets along with declining prices have negatively impacted profitability of companies in the energy and chemical market segment this has resulted in customer cut backs on capital spending and some slowing in the replacement business particularly in the americas and europe other applied markets showed net growth as growth in the pharmaceutical and biotech markets was partially offset by decline in the academic and government markets 

the overall macroeconomic weakness has affected demand for our instruments and application solutions and we expect that to continue in the near term despite this weakness we will continue to invest in research and development and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets our new products released during the year such as the gcms qtof icpqqq and mpaes have demonstrated strong market acceptance in addition we are focusing on improvements in profitability of the varian portfolio by refreshing products and consolidating supply chain activities 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the chemical analysis businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2012  versus 2011  and 2011  versus 2010  





gross margins in 2012 remained flat compared to 2011 higher product discounts were offset by favorable revenue volume and lower material costs gross margins declined by 2 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the addition of the varian portfolio which has lower gross margins and higher logistics costs 

research and development expenses remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 we continue to make investments in product rd research and development expenses increased 35 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by the varian acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 investments in sales channel coverage with a focus on emerging markets were offset by lower commissions and discretionary spending selling general and administrative expenses increased 26 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by the varian acquisition 

operating margins increased by 1 percentage point in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was mainly due to favorable gross profit from higher revenue while holding expenses flat operating margins declined by 3 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decline in gross margins and increase in incremental operating expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2012 increased by 25 million or 8 percent on a revenue increase of 41 million a 60 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental income from operations in 2011 increased by 34 million or 12 percent compared to 2010 on a revenue increase of 318 million an 11 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental

orders and net revenue 



diagnostics and genomics orders in 2012 increased 44 percent compared to 2011 the incremental orders associated with the acquisition of dako accounted for 32 percent of our diagnostics and genomics business and 45 percentage points of the order growth in 2012 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable currency impact of 1 percentage points on the yearoveryear excluding the impact of the dako acquisition the 2012 order growth was led by strength in cgh array haloplex genespring and bioanalyzer chips  reagents geographically excluding the impact of the dako acquisition orders declined 5 percent in the americas 2 percent in europe and 2 percent in other asia pacific as a result of macroeconomic pressures in the americas and europe japan saw order growth of 12 percent compared to 2011 driven by the strong order performance as the country recovers from the triple disaster tsunami earthquake and nuclear reactor meltdown in 2011 diagnostics and genomics orders in 2011 increased 13 percent compared to 2010 order results were led by strength in sureselect microarrays and bioanalyzer sales geographically orders grew 5 percent in the americas 15 percent in europe 21 percent in japan and 32 percent in other asia pacific during 2011 when compared to 2010 

diagnostics and genomics net revenue in 2012 increased 45 percent compared to 2011 there was 126 million in revenue associated with the acquisition of dako in 2012 the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of dako accounted for 31 percent of our diagnostics and genomics business and 45 percentage points of revenue growth in 2012 compared to 2011 foreign currency movements for 2012 had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point compared to 2011 the increase in services and other revenue in 2012 was due to the dako acquisition excluding the impact of the dako acquisition revenue growth was led by tapestations haloplex bioanalyzer consumables and cgh arrays offset by declines in microarrays and sureselect revenue associated with the dako acquisition consisted primarily of ihc product offerings geographically excluding the impact of the dako acquisition revenues declined 1 percent in the americas 4 percent in europe 36 percent in other asia pacific and grew 74 percent in japan during 2012 when compared to 2011 diagnostics and genomics net revenue in 2011 increased 9 percent compared to 2010 foreign currency movements for 2011 had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points compared to 2010 revenue growth was led by sureselect and followed by solid performance in cgh and gene expression microarrays as well as bioanalyzers geographically revenues declined 2 percent in the americas grew 19 percent in europe 17 percent in japan and 26 percent in other asia pacific during 2011 when compared to 2010 

during 2012 we saw strong revenue growth in the clinical diagnostics and the pharmaceutical and biotech markets with offsetting declines in the academic and government market solid growth in the clinical market reflected increased investments in genomics applications driven by aging populations all over the world and greater use of next generation sequencing within clinical centers the cancer diagnostics market remained robust within pathology staining as the fundamental sociodemographic growth drivers continued to increase test volumes while the more efficient automation solutions and test procedure standardization drove demand due to its cost and labor reduction advantages growth in the pharmaceutical and biotech market was strong reflecting worldwide outsourcing demand for preclinical research and development as patents expire and generic drugs expand rapidly the academia and government market remained soft in 2012 due to the us and european cautious funding environments however next generation sequencing continues to attract government funding in many fields including medical science microbiology and bioagriculture in 2011 we saw positive revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and biotech academic and government markets as well as solid growth in the clinical market 

looking forward we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the clinical research market as our broad portfolio of products especially surefish haloplex and cgh microarrays are well suited to address customer needs the addition of haloplex has strengthened our target enrichment offerings and sales have exceeded our expectation we have plans to continue investing in target enrichment as next generation sequencing moves into the research clinic we are committed to the microarray business and have partnered with a former competitor who is exiting the microarray business to transition their customers onto agilent microarrays further growing our installed base we continue to expand our surefish menu of probes and are now at over 450 probes targeting both cancer and constitutional applications including translocation probes targeting leukemia for cancer market we are always looking selectively at acquisition opportunities to better serve our customers and to drive future growth   

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows diagnostics and genomics margins expenses and income from operations for 2012  versus 2011  and 2011  versus 2010  





gross margins improved by 2 percentage points in 2012 compared to 2011 the improved gross margins were due to the acquisition of dako lower royalty expenses due to a decline of certain key royaltybearing products and a favorable hedging impact in 2012 gross margins improved by 2 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to favorable currency impacts lower royalty expenses due to a decline of certain key royaltybearing products and favorable product mix in favor of higher margin consumable and reagent revenues 

research and development expenses increased 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the acquisition of dako offset by lower project expenses research and development expenses increased 4 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 driven mainly by the lab901 acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 41 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was due to the acquisition of dako partially offset by decreases in commission expenses and infrastructure expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the lab901 acquisition 

operating margins improved by 4 percentage points in 2012 compared to 2011 operating margins improved by 5 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 factors which led to operating margin improvement over both periods have been explained in the above discussions on better gross margins and well controlled operating expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2012 increased by 30 million or 88 percent on a revenue increase of 125 million a 24 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental income from operations in 2011 increased by 17 million or 92 percent compared to 2010 on a revenue increase of 24 million a 69 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental 

electronic measurement 

our electronic measurement business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems software design tools and related services that are used in the design development manufacture installation deployment and operation of electronics equipment and microscopy products related services include startup assistance instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair we also offer customization consulting and optimization services throughout the customers product lifecycle 

orders and net revenue 



electronic measurement orders declined 1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 foreign currency movements had a slightly unfavorable impact on the yearoveryear growth rate growth in our communications test business reflected solid wireless communications demand partially offset by a decline in broadband communications orders general purpose test was lower yearoveryear on weaker industrial and lower aerospace and defense business partially offset by higher computer and semiconductor test orders on a geographic basis orders increased 13 percent in the americas but declined by 3 percent in japan 7 percent in europe and 11 percent in asia pacific excluding japan yearoveryear changes in communications test demand contributed to the order growth in the americas and the decline in asia pacific excluding japan electronic measurement orders increased 10 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 order growth in wireless manufacturing industrial and computers and semiconductor test was partially offset by a decline in network monitoring orders associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business 

electronic measurement revenue was flat in 2012 compared to 2011 on flat demand for both general purpose and communications test foreign currency movements had minimal impact on yearoveryear growth regionally revenue from the americas increased 10 percent reflecting strong communications test business offset by declines of 1 percent in japan 5 percent in asia pacific excluding japan and 11 percent in europe the decline in europe reflected a broader market slowdown and general economic weakness revenue from products was flat yearoveryear while service related revenue increased 3 percent due to our installed base electronic measurement revenue increased 19 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 on strong demand from industrial computers and semiconductor and wireless communications test partially offset by a decrease in network monitoring associated with the divestiture of the networks solutions business 

general purpose test revenue representing approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue reflected slight growth in computers and semiconductor business flat industrial test demand and a slight decline in aerospace and defense growth in the computers and semiconductor business reflected continuing demand for digital test driven in part by the proliferation of high speed data transmission and increased investments in new semiconductor processes and technology partially offset by a decline in semiconductor manufacturing uncertain global economic conditions contributed to flat revenue for industrial or general purpose application test our aerospace and defense business reflected stronger demand from the united states government offset by softer demand from international customers including asia in 2011 general purpose test represented 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue with strong demand from industrial computer and semiconductor test customers 

communications test revenue representing approximately 37 percent of electronic measurement revenue reflected strong wireless manufacturing test demand offset by lower wireless rd and broadband communications business strength in wireless manufacturing was driven by capacity expansion for smartphones and the associated supply chain though investments continued in high data rate applications including longterm evolution “lte” economic uncertainty and cautious spending by customers contributed to soft wireless rd demand broadband communications moderated following a period of strong investment associated with the evolution to datadriven services in 2011 communications test represented 37 percent of electronic measurement revenue reflecting growth in wireless and broadband communications partially offset by a decline in network monitoring revenue due to the divestiture of the network solutions business 

looking forward we expect a cautious spending environment driven by ongoing global economic uncertainty there continues to be downward pressure on the aerospace and defense market with nearterm uncertainty relating to the budget for the united states government we anticipate continued interest in highspeed digital test applications with limited investment in semiconductor manufacturing capacity communications test demand is expected to moderate on decelerating smartphone capacity expansion and conservative spending in rd 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the electronic measurement businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2012  versus 2011  and 2011  versus 2010  





gross margins declined 2 percentage points in 2012 compared to 2011 on flat revenue the unfavorable impact of a higher proportion of lower gross margin wireless manufacturing business and slightly higher expenses were partially offset by lower variable and incentive pay gross margins were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 with the favorable impact of volume offset by the unfavorable impact of currency movements unfavorable mix with a higher proportion of lower gross margin wireless manufacturing business increased variable and incentive pay and higher infrastructure costs 

research and development expenses declined 1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 decreases in variable and incentive pay and infrastructure costs were partially offset by incremental spending associated with new acquisitions and wage increases research and development expenses declined 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions of which a portion related to the network solutions business divestiture were partially offset by higher variable and incentive pay and the unfavorable impact of currency movements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 lower variable and incentive pay infrastructure costs and commissions were partially offset by wage increases selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions partially related to the network solutions divestiture were offset by the unfavorable impact of currency movements and higher variable and incentive pay 

  

operating margins were approximately the same in 2012 compared to 2011 on flat revenue lower gross margins were mostly offset by reductions in operating expenses operating margins improved by 7 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 higher revenue volume and lower infrastructure costs were partially offset by increased variable and incentive pay and the unfavorable impact of currency movements 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2012 decreased by 9 million or 1 percent compared to 2011 on flat revenue reflecting the net impact of lower gross margins mostly offset by reductions in expenses income from operations in 2011 increased by 322 million or 74 percent compared to 2010 on a revenue increase of 532 million a 61 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental that reflected the benefits of higher revenue volume and limited expense growth

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2012 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 55 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2012 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 5 million compared to 5 million as of october 31 2011 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments related to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 84 million within the next year and 1 million thereafter 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2012 or october 31 2011 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our shortterm and longterm debt as of october 31 2012 in millions 



we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts interest rates and payment dates are detailed in shortterm debt and longterm debt 

other longterm liabilities include 320 million and 356 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2012 and october 31 2011 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2012  64 percent of our revenues in 2011  and 63 percent of our revenues in 2010  were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2012  and 2011 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2012  and 2011 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 649 million in 2011 612 million in 2010 and 642 million in 2009 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

on october 31 2011 our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately 810 million as compared to approximately 830 million at october 31 2010 on october 31 2011 our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately 320 million as compared to approximately 250 million at october 31 2010 within our life sciences business our unfilled orders were approximately 430 million on october 31 2011 as compared to approximately 350 million at october 31 2010 we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled orders represent approximately three months worth of revenues in light of this experience backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal our electronic measurement chemical analysis and life sciences businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the 

risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company hewlettpackard company hp as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hp hp will have access to these properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located although hp has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the naming of agilent will not affect hps obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to 

which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2011 68 percent in fiscal 2010 and 67 percent in fiscal 2009 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2011 14 percent in fiscal 2010 and 13 percent in fiscal 2009 approximately 11 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2011 10 percent in fiscal 2010 and 11 percent in fiscal 2009 was derived from japan revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 56 percent in fiscal year 2011 52 percent in fiscal year 2010 and 51 percent in fiscal year 2009 approximately 13 13 and 16 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition and disposal of material assets 

on may 14 2010 we completed our acquisition of varian inc a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications for a total cash purchase price of approximately 15 billion varians products include analytical instruments research products and related software consumable products accessories and services as well as vacuum products and related services and accessories the acquisition broadens agilents applications and solutions offerings in life sciences environmental and energy and materials it also expands agilents product portfolio into atomic and molecular spectroscopy establishes a leading position in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and vacuum technologies and strengthens our consumables portfolio we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash varians cash acquired at completion of the acquisition was approximately 226 million

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

depressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our products and increases in order cancellations • increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories • increased price pressure for our products and services • reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the us and • greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions including declines related to the current market disruptions described above would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services for example we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during 2009 due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our ability to sustain profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs • innovate and develop new technologies services and applications • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner • manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time • differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings • price our products competitively • anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and • control product quality in our manufacturing process dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it function and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of the it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for 

some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner and could lead to order cancellations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations • differing labor regulations • differing protection of intellectual property • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and • geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables 

functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

if we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of varian inc our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of varian the acquisition involves the integration of varian with the rest of our company if we cannot successfully integrate varians operations we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and timeconsuming process that will involve a number of risks including but not limited to 

• diversion of senior managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations 25 

• difficulties in the assimilation of different practices and sales and distribution methodologies as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel • difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities departments systems including accounting systems computer and other technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards including internal accounting controls procedures and policies • difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies and • the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our current expectations which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of varian we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected • the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market and • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to varians products as a result of these risks the varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year for example during fiscal 2010 we closed our acquisition of varian inc and the sale of our network solutions division during fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisitions of a2 technologies lab901 and biocius life sciences inc during fiscal 2012 we announced our acquisitions of accelicon technologies biosystem development llc and halo genomics ab as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions including the varian acquisition and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

• the retention of key employees 26 

• the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas • the retention of key customers • the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company and • the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to 

• effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser • identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and • reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations further if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

the impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation for instance in june 2011 danaher corporation completed its acquisition of beckman coulter inc and in august 2011 thermo fisher scientific completed its acquisition of phadia consolidation in the electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to our properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

we have agreed to indemnify hp for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hp to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our 

best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act we must conform the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

a number of our products from our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of non compliance fines injunctions and civil penalties partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result 

in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing 

competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the satisfaction of our ongoing debt obligations including our senior notes coming due in september 2012 the repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through 1 the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or 2 other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 21 billion in senior unsecured notes we also are a party to a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in october 2016 and under which we may borrow up to 400 million we may borrow additional amounts 

in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions • requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions and stock repurchases and • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

our results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our longterm leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit support on the leasehold transaction fails 

in february 2001 we sold a parcel of surplus land in san jose california for 287 million in cash in august 2001 we completed a likekind exchange by acquiring a longterm leasehold interest in several municipal properties in southern california for a total value of 289 million in 2002 we received 237 million in nonrefundable prepaid rent related to the leasehold interests described 

above we contracted with a third party to provide credit protection for certain aspects of the transaction including a future bankruptcy of the municipality the current third party insurer is a subsidiary of american international group inc aig which experienced a credit rating downgrade by moodys investors service and standard  poors and has been the recipient of us federal government sponsored loans if the municipality was to become insolvent and the credit support on the transaction was to fail our results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of october 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 353 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november 2001 a securities class action kassin v agilent technologies inc et al civil action no 01cv10639 was filed in united states district court for the southern district of new york the court against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ipo agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the ipo in 2003 the court granted agilents motion to dismiss the claims against agilent based on section 10 of the securities exchange act but denied agilents motion to dismiss the claims based on section 11 of the securities act on june 14 

2004 papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the court under the proposed settlement plaintiffs claims against agilent and its directors and officers would be released in exchange for a contingent payment which if made would be paid by agilents insurer and an assignment of certain potential claims however class certification of plaintiffs underlying action against the underwriter defendants was a condition of the settlement on december 5 2006 the court of appeals for the second circuit the second circuit reversed the courts order certifying such a class in several test cases that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs on january 5 2007 plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full bench of the second circuit on april 6 2007 the second circuit issued an order denying rehearing but noted that plaintiffs are free to seek certification of a more modest class on june 25 2007 the court entered an order terminating the proposed settlement between plaintiffs and the issuer defendants based on a stipulation among the parties plaintiffs have amended their allegations and filed amended complaints in six test cases none of which involve agilent defendants in these cases have moved to dismiss the amended complaints on march 26 2008 the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the parties have again reached a global settlement of the litigation and filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on april 2 2009 under the settlement the insurers would pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to agilent and agilent would bear no financial liability agilent as well as the officer and director defendants who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements would receive complete dismissals from the case on october 5 2009 the court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement four objectors appealed the courts order to the second circuit two withdrew their respective appeals of the remaining two appeals the second circuit dismissed one and remanded the other to the court for a determination of whether this objector is a proper member of the plaintiff class the court found this objector was not a proper class member but this objector has now appealed that decision to the second circuit that appeal remains pending 

we are involved in lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including but not limited to patent commercial and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business there are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview and executive summary 

agilent is the worlds premier measurement company providing core electronic and bioanalytical measurement solutions to the communications electronics life sciences and chemical analysis industries our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

for the year ended october 31 2011 we acquired three separate businesses a2 technologies lab901 and biocius life sciences inc for a total cost of 96 million net of cash acquired 

agilents total orders in 2011 were 6769 million an increase of 18 percent when compared to 2010 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 due to the close date of the varian acquisition which occurred on may 14 2010 we have excluded orders related to varian for the period november 1 2010 to may 14 2011 when we compare periods without the varian acquisition the increase in orders in the year ended october 31 2011 compared with last year was attributable to improvement in many of our instrument platforms consumables and services agilents total orders in 2010 increased 28 percent when compared to 2009 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 the increase in orders in the year ended october 31 2010 compared with the prior year was due to a strong performance in new products and service and support businesses 

agilents net revenue of 6615 million increased 22 percent when compared to 2010 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for approximately 5 percentage points of the revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 due to the close date of the varian acquisition which occurred on may 14 2010 we have excluded revenue related to varian for the period november 1 2010 to may 14 2011 when we compare periods without the varian acquisition 

excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture growth in demand for life sciences products increased in all markets led by sales into the pharmaceutical and biotechnology endmarket for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to the prior year excluding the varian acquisition sales to all endmarkets grew across the chemical analysis business in particular the petrochemical market for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 within electronic measurement general purpose endmarkets improved in 2011 when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses also within electronic measurement the communications test businesses improved strongly in the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing reporting good revenue growth in the year agilents total net revenue in 2010 increased 21 percent when compared to 2009 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 

net income was 1012 million in 2011 compared to net income of 684 million in 2010 and a net loss of 31 million in 2009 in 2011 2010 and 2009 we generated operating cash flows of 1260 million 718 million and 408 million respectively as of october 31 2011 and 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 3527 million and 2649 million respectively 

on may 14 2010 we completed our acquisition of varian by means of a merger of one of our whollyowned subsidiaries with and into varian such that varian became a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash the varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of varian are included in agilents consolidated financial statements from the date of merger for additional details related to the acquisition of varian see note 3 acquisition of varian 

looking forward we believe there are continued marketing opportunities in emerging markets and improvements to be achieved in operating performance by leveraging our design supply chain and manufacturing capabilities in addition we will continue integrating varians order fulfillment systems and processes into agilent and our priority is to focus on revenue and cost synergies as well as increase technology sharing between our businesses as a result of the integration of varian into agilent we are expecting to achieve 100 million in net cost savings approximately 1  3 of the net cost savings have been generated within general and administrative expenses at the end of fiscal 2011 and the remaining savings within the costs of products and services are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2013 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which may result in changes in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal quarter which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the ltpp were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant the espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the purchase price and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value 

both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of agilents stock option over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 35 percent to 45 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 23 percent if no other factors were changed 

in 2009 and 2010 the expected life of our employee stock options was 44 years in the first quarter of 2011 we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 44 to 58 years for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1 2010 we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 58 years we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants made during the three months ended january 31 2011 which we believe is representative of future behavior see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include  expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date — october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2011 and 2010 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio and decreased in 2011 from the previous year in 2011 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate 

bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us pension expense and 17 million on nonus pension expense the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were 58 million in 2011 82 million in 2010 and 103 million in 2009 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

in september 2011 the fasb approved changes to the goodwill impairment guidance which are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test the changes provide entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the revised standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current twostep test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the revised guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

the new qualitative indicators replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required the changes will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however earlier adoption is permitted agilent has opted to early adopt this guidance for the year ended october 31 2011 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount 

of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

based on our results of our qualitative test for goodwill impairment as of september 30 2011 we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each of our three reporting units life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement is greater than their respective carrying values there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2011 2010 and 2009 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years in process research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of longlived assets including purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2011 and recorded 3 million of impairment charges primarily related to a business where we ceased operations we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2010 and recorded 13 million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions the consolidation of excess facilities asset impairments and special charges related to inventory workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises these estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance we have also assessed the recoverability of our longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows asset impairments primarily consist of property plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the 

calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2011 we provided a valuation allowance for our net us deferred tax assets and on certain foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

due to improvements in the us operating results over the past three years management believes a reasonable possibility exists that within the next year sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that the us valuation allowance will no longer be needed 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated a material impact on income tax expense could result 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring costs asset impairments and other charges 

our 2009 restructuring program the fy 2009 plan announced in the first half of 2009 was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle workforce reduction payments primarily severance were largely complete in fiscal year 2010 lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies 

of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term 

results from operations 

orders and net revenue 



  



agilents total orders in 2011 were 6769 million an increase of 18 percent when compared to 2010 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 5 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 due to the close date of the varian acquisition which occurred on may 14 2010 we have excluded orders related to varian for the period november 1 2010 to may 14 2011 when we compare periods without the varian acquisition the increase in orders in the year ended october 31 2011 compared with last year was attributable to improvement in many of our instrument platforms consumables and services agilents total orders in 2010 increased 28 percent when compared to 2009 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 the increase in orders in the year ended october 31 2010 compared with the prior year was due to a strong performance in new products and service and support businesses 

agilents net revenue of 6615 million increased 22 percent when compared to 2010 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for approximately 5 percentage points of the revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 due to the close date of the varian acquisition which occurred on may 14 2010 we have excluded revenue related to varian for the period november 1 2010 to may 14 2011 when we compare periods without the varian acquisition excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture growth in demand for 

life sciences products increased in all markets led by sales into the pharmaceutical and biotechnology endmarket for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to the prior year excluding the varian acquisition sales to all endmarkets grew across the chemical analysis business in particular the petrochemical market for the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to 2010 within electronic measurement general purpose endmarkets improved in 2011 when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses also within electronic measurement the communications test businesses improved in the year ended october 31 2011 when compared to the prior year with wireless manufacturing reporting good revenue growth in the year agilents total net revenue in 2010 increased 21 percent when compared to 2009 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 note 21 segment information shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue 

services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting services and other revenue increased 16 percent in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase in services and other revenue associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 2 percentage point of revenue increase in 2011 services and other revenue increased 7 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in services and other revenue associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 1 percentage point of revenue increase in 2010 the service and other revenue growth is lower than product revenue growth due to only a proportion of product sales attracting service contracts the recognition of warranty revenue over an extended period and a portion of the revenue being driven more by the previously installed base than current period product sales 

backlog 

on october 31 2011 our unfilled orders for the life sciences business were approximately 430 million as compared to approximately 350 million at october 31 2010 on october 31 2011 our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately 320 million as compared to approximately 250 million at october 31 2010 on october 31 2011 our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately 810 million as compared to 830 million at october 31 2010 we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled orders represent approximately three months worth of revenues in light of this experience backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 



in 2011 total gross margin decreased 1 percentage point in comparison to 2010 the unfavorable impact of the varian acquisition including fair value adjustments and higher variable and incentive pay were largely offset by the benefits of favorable volume impacts decreased business and infrastructure programs and lower restructuring costs operating margins in 2011 increased 6 percentage points as compared to 2010 due to higher volume partly offset by increased variable and incentive pay in 2010 total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2009 and operating margins in 2010 increased 9 percentage points as compared to 2009 the benefits of business and infrastructure programs lower restructuring costs together with favorable volume impacts offset the unfavorable impact of the varian acquisition including fair value adjustments wage restoration and higher variable and incentive pay 

research and development expenditures increased 6 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in new product development the varian acquisition and higher variable and incentive pay these increases were partly offset by the impact of the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses and decreased restructuring expenses research and development expenditures decreased 5 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 increases in expenses due to the varian acquisition wage restoration higher variable and incentive pay were more than offset by the impact of the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses and decreased restructuring expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 increased expenditure was due to the varian acquisition and higher variable and incentive pay offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the costs associated with the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 increased expenditure was due to the varian acquisition higher variable and incentive pay and wage restoration offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses 

gross inventory charges were 30 million in 2011 and 2010 and 54 million in 2009 sales of previously written down inventory were 5 million in 2011 and 2010 and 8 million in 2009 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct five types of research and development basic research foundation technologies communications life sciences and measurement our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solutions life sciences and photonics in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20000 products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense we remain committed to invest about 10 percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

for the year ended october 31 2010 we recorded a 132 million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and 54 million of income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with hewlett packard company 

at october 31 2011 our headcount was approximately 18700 compared to 18500 in 2010 and 16800 in 2009 the increase in our headcount in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the varian acquisition 

provision for income taxes 



agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 127 million 62 million and 14 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income loss per share diluted was approximately 036 018 and 004 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

for 2011 the effective tax rate was 2 percent the 2 percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates and includes a 97 million net tax benefit primarily associated with a refund in canada and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals due to the reassessment of certain uncertain tax positions the income tax provision also includes a 26 million out of period adjustment to reduce the carrying value of certain uk deferred tax assets for which the majority was recorded in the quarter ended april 30 2011 the overstatement of these deferred tax assets resulted in an overstatement of the uk valuation allowance release in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the full year this out of period adjustment was substantially offset by other out of period adjustments the net impact of all out of period adjustments on the effective tax rate was immaterial without considering interest and penalties the effective rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances we intend to maintain valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

for 2010 the effective tax rate was 1 percent the 1 percent effective tax rate includes a 101 million beneficial release of the uk valuation allowance a 32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates also included is a 17 million tax benefit related to a 54 million nontaxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard company without considering interest and penalties the effective rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

for 2009 the effective tax rate was 543 percent the 543 percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component that results in unusual tax results on reduced levels of profitability the tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates in addition net tax benefits totaling 71 million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate without considering interest and penalties the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances 

during 2003 we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis during 2009 2010 and 2011 we continued to maintain valuation allowance for us federal and state deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal we currently have a valuation allowance of 369 million of which 308 million relates to us jurisdictions the reduction to the valuation allowance in 2011 is primarily due to the reduction in the deferred taxes relating to pension and post retirement medical benefits and the utilization of tax credits associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings due to improvements in the us operating results over the past three years management believes a reasonable possibility exists that within the next year sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that the us valuation allowance will no longer be needed in 2010 after consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the uk deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire uk valuation allowance 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on august 31 2010 we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for tax years 2000 through 2002 the adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our statement of operations in december 2010 we reached an agreement with the irs for tax years 20032005 in addition agilent and the irs reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 20032007 tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards agilents us federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2007 are currently under audit by the irs primarily as a result of these agreements with the irs and agreements with other tax jurisdictions unrecognized tax benefits were reduced from 656 million at october 31 2010 to 469 million at october 31 2011

orders and net revenue 



electronic measurement orders increased 10 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 foreign currency movements had a slightly favorable impact on the yearoveryear growth rate key contributors to the yearoveryear growth included strength in wireless manufacturing and digital test that was partially offset by a decline in network monitoring orders associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business order growth associated with component manufacturers semiconductor 

companies and service and support was solid yearoveryear on a geographic basis 2011 orders increased 3 percent in the americas 3 percent in europe 20 percent in japan and 21 percent in asia pacific excluding japan electronic measurement orders increased 25 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting broadbased economic recovery with strength in industrial and wireless rd and manufacturing demand partially offset by a decline in network monitoring orders relating to the divestiture of the network solutions business 

electronic measurement revenues increased 19 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 due to strength in both general purpose and communications test markets revenue growth exceeded order growth yearoveryear due to backlog build in 2010 with orders higher than revenue and a slight decrease in backlog in 2011 foreign currency movements were slightly favorable contributing to yearoveryear growth regionally revenues from the americas increased 17 percent europe grew 15 percent japan improved 30 percent reflecting strong wireless test business and asia pacific excluding japan increased 20 percent compared to 2010 due to strong semiconductor business earlier in the fiscal year and ongoing wireless test demand revenue from products increased 23 percent yearoveryear while service related revenue was flat due to the divestiture of the network solutions business electronic measurement revenues increased 15 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 due to strong growth across all key markets particularly industrial and wireless manufacturing demand partially offset by a decrease in network monitoring associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business 

general purpose test revenues representing approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenues reflected strong demand from industrial computers and semiconductor customers and moderating growth in aerospace and defense overall improvement in economic conditions supported greater demand from customers with industrial or general purpose applications growth in the computers and semiconductor business reflected strong demand for digital test driven in part by the proliferation of high speed data transmission and strength in semiconductor test due to growth in end user markets including smartphones aerospace and defense business was solid reflecting strong demand for information management and surveillance applications moderated by the general funding uncertainty in the united states for the department of defense in 2010 general purpose test represented 64 percent of electronic measurement revenues reflecting strong computers and semiconductor business and solid industrial and aerospace and defense related demand 

communications test revenues representing approximately 37 percent of electronic measurement experienced growth in wireless rd and manufacturing and other communications test partly offset by a decline in network monitoring revenues due to the divestiture of the network solutions business solid growth in wireless rd reflected more favorable market conditions and targeted investments in high data rate applications including longterm evolution lte an emerging wireless standard that is in the early stages of adoption strength in wireless manufacturing was driven by growth in smartphones and continued 3g expansion strong growth in other communications test reflected the expansion of broadband technologies driven by the evolution to datadriven services in 2010 communications test represented 36 percent of electronic measurement revenues reflecting a broad recovery in communications markets with growth in all submarkets except for the decline in network monitoring revenues due to the divestiture of the network solutions business 

looking forward we expect moderating growth rates as a result of comparisons to strong 2011 results we anticipate the communications test business to remain solid driven by growth in smartphones continuing 3g expansion and further adoption of the new wireless standard lte we expect moderating demand in our general purpose segment in the near term reflecting a cautious spending environment given the global economic uncertainty and relatively flat aerospace and defense business in the us 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the electronic measurement businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2011 versus 2010 and 2010 versus 2009 



gross margins for products and services were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 on an absolute basis and slightly lower on a volumeadjusted basis changes in gross margins reflected the favorable impact of higher volume offset by the unfavorable impact of currency movements unfavorable mix with a higher proportion of lower gross margin wireless manufacturing business increased variable and incentive pay and higher infrastructure costs in 2010 gross margins improved 5 percentage points compared to 2009 primarily due to higher volume and a lower cost structure 

research and development expenses declined 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 the decline was driven primarily by lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions of which a portion related to the network solutions business divestiture that were partially offset by higher variable and incentive pay and the unfavorable impact of currency movements research and development expenses declined 8 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting savings from restructuring programs lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions partially offset by wage restoration higher variable and incentive pay and the unfavorable impact of currency movements 

selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 similar to rd yearoveryear changes included lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions partly related to the network solutions divestiture offset by the unfavorable impact of currency movements and higher variable and incentive pay selling general and administrative expenses declined 8 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting savings from restructuring programs lower infrastructure costs and reduced spending partly offset by wage restoration higher variable pay and commissions and unfavorable impact of currency movements 

operating margins improved by 7 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the combination of higher revenue volume and lower infrastructure costs partly offset by increased variable and incentive pay and the unfavorable impact of currency movements operating margins increased 16 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting higher revenue volume and structural and operational expense reductions 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2011 increased by 322 million or 74 percent compared to 2010 on a revenue increase of 532 million a 61 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental that reflected the benefits of higher revenue volume and limited expense growth going forward the yearoveryear operating margin incremental is expected to moderate as compares are made against relatively stronger 2011 results income from operations in 2010 increased by 437 million or 100 percent compared to 2009 on a revenue increase of 366 million a 119 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental that included the benefit of structural and operational expense reductions

38 million in 2010 proceeds from divestitures were 1 million in 2011 compared to 205 million in 2010 

net cash provided byused in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2011 was 1693 million compared to 601 million and 657 million net cash provided in 2010 and 2009 respectively we satisfied the 1500 million financing obligation of world trade in its entirety on december 10 2010 

treasury stock repurchases 

on november 19 2009 our board of directors approved a sharerepurchase program to reduce or eliminate dilution of basic outstanding shares in connection with issuances of stock under the companys equity incentive plans the sharerepurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time there is no fixed termination date for the new sharerepurchase program for the year ended october 31 2011 we repurchased approximately 12 million shares for 497 million for the year ended october 31 2010 we repurchased 13 million shares for 411 million 

credit facility 

on october 20 2011 we entered into a fiveyear credit agreement which provides for a 400 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on october 20 2016 the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2011 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility the credit agreement replaced the companys prior fiveyear credit agreement dated as of may 11 2007 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement we were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facilities during the year ended october 31 2011 

shortterm debt 

on september 9 2009 the company issued an aggregate principal amount of 250 million in senior notes maturing in 2012 2012 notes the 2012 notes were issued at 9991 of their principal amount bear interest at a fixed rate of 445 per annum and mature on september 14 2012 interest is payable semiannually on march 14th and september 14th of each year and payments commenced on march 14 2010 

upon the closing of the offering of the 2012 senior notes we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 250 million under the interest rate swaps we will receive fixedrate interest payments and will make payments based on the us dollar libor plus 258 basis points with respect to the 2012 senior notes the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixedrate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable liborbased interest rate the hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes at october 31 2011 the fair value of the swaps on 2012 senior notes was an asset of 3 million with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of 2012 senior notes

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2011 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 48 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill almost all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2011 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 5 million compared to 4 million as of october 31 2010 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments we have categorized other purchase commitments as contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancelable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be cancelled our contractual obligations with these suppliers under other purchase commitments were approximately 62 million for the next year 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and non us defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2011 or october 31 2010 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our shortterm and longterm debt as of october 31 2011in millions 



we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts interest rates and payment dates are detailed in net cash provided byused in financing activities 

other longterm liabilities include 356 million and 430 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2011 and october 31 2010 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 64 percent of our revenues in 2011 63 percent of our revenues in 2010 and 62 percent of our revenues in 2009 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2011 and 2010 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk the interest rate swaps effectively change our fixed interest rate payments to us dollar liborbased variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash cash equivalents and other short term investments by entering into these interest rate swaps we are also hedging the movements in the fair value of the fixedrate debt on our balance sheet however not all of our fixed rate debts fair value is hedged in this manner and in the future we may choose to terminate previously executed swaps as of october 31 2011 we held interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 250 million associated with our 2012 senior notes 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2011 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

  the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental international operations and acquisition and disposal of material assets include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 612 million in 2010 642 million in 2009 and 704 million in 2008 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services 

backlog 

on october 31 2010 our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately 830 million as compared to approximately 670 million at october 31 2009 on october 31 2010 our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately 250 million as compared to approximately 160 million at october 31 2009 within our life sciences business our unfilled orders were approximately 350 million on october 31 2010 as compared to approximately 210 million at october 31 2009 we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled orders represent approximately three months worth of revenues in light of this experience backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage while we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal our electronic measurement chemical analysis and life sciences businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the us even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company hewlettpackard company hp as part of the initial separation agreement from hp in 1999 hp agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us if any could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hp will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hp hp will have access to these properties to perform the remediation hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation the remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from hp have been sold 

in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by hp under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located although hp has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the naming of agilent will not affect hps obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters 

we are liable and are indemnifying hp for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hp excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are obligated to indemnify hp for liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations if any at all properties transferred to us by hp as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future 

we are being indemnified by hp with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hp accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity 

as part of our acquisition of varian in 2010 we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmentalrelated matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the us as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 68 percent in fiscal 2010 67 percent in fiscal 2009 and 68 percent in fiscal 2008 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments annual revenues derived from china were approximately 14 percent in fiscal 2010 13 percent in fiscal 2009 and 11 percent in fiscal 2008 approximately 10 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2010 11 percent in fiscal 2009 and 12 percent in fiscal 2008 was derived from japan revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the agilent sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the us as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 52 percent in fiscal year 2010 51 percent in fiscal year 2009 and 48 percent in fiscal 

year 2008 approximately 13 16 and 14 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the us 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition and disposal of material assets 

on may 14 2010 we completed our acquisition of varian inc a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications for a total cash purchase price of approximately 15 billion varians products include analytical instruments research products and related software consumable products accessories and services as well as vacuum products and related services and accessories the acquisition broadens agilents applications and solutions offerings in life sciences environmental and energy and materials it also expands agilents product portfolio into atomic and molecular spectroscopy establishes a leading position in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and vacuum technologies and strengthens our consumables portfolio we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash varians cash acquired at completion of the acquisition was approximately 226 million

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

depressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us in the past two years the world economy has been suffering an economic downturn including an extreme disruption in worldwide financial markets beginning in 2008 we are unable to predict the strength and duration of an economic recovery a continuing andor a return to an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our products and increases in order cancellations • increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories • increased price pressure for our products and services • reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the us and • greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to 

forecast in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions including declines related to the current market disruptions described above would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services for example we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during 2009 due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our ability to sustain profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins 

the actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

since december 2008 we have announced and implemented significant restructuring activities in our global infrastructure organization and our electronic measurement segment this restructuring program and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost structure could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and consequently could have longterm effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products affecting our ability to respond to customers limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel these circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs • innovate and develop new technologies services and applications • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner • manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time • differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings • price our products competitively • anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and • control product quality in our manufacturing process 23 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it function and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of the it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results we are already seeing a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations • differing labor regulations • differing protection of intellectual property • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and • geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond that twelve month period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties these financial institutions generally have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with 

reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts 

the impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

the electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation for instance in february 2010 danaher corporation completed its acquisition of the life sciences instrumentation businesses from mds inc and life technologies corp consolidation in the electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year for example in fiscal 2009 we completed a number of acquisitions and divestitures in may 2010 we closed our acquisition of varian inc and the sale of our network solutions division as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions including the varian acquisition and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

• the retention of key employees • the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas • the retention of key customers • the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company and • the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause 

investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to 

• effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser • identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and • reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations further if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

if we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of varian inc our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of varian the acquisition involves the integration of varian with the rest of our company if we cannot successfully integrate varians operations we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and timeconsuming process that will involve a number of risks including but not limited to 

• diversion of senior managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations • difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures practices and sales and distribution methodologies as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel • the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to join the combined business • the potential loss of key customers who choose not to do business with the combined business • the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products • difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities departments systems including accounting systems computer and other technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards including internal accounting controls procedures and policies • difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies and • the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our current expectations which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt 27 

even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of varian we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected • the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our bioanalytical measurement business and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market • our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the acquisition or liabilities related to the acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to varians products and • the risk that we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements to the extent that we incur debt to pay for the acquisition as a result of these risks the varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination hp will have access to our properties to perform remediation while hp has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations in addition the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation 

we have agreed to indemnify hp for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hp to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

our current and historical manufacturing processes involve or have involved the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago and verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

as part of our acquisition of varian we assumed the liabilities of varian including varians costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters one such cost is our obligation along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates inc vsea under the terms of a distribution agreement between varian vsea and varian medical systems inc vms to each indemnify vms for onethird of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates inc vai and thirdparty claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities and b us environmental protection agency or thirdparty claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling treatment or disposal the cercla sites with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai vms is overseeing the environmental investigation monitoring andor remediation activities in most cases under the direction of or in consultation with federal state andor local agencies and handling thirdparty claims vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites although any ultimate liability arising from environmentalrelated matters could result in significant expenditures that if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year could be material to our financial statements the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmentalrelated events management believes that the costs of environmentalrelated matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act we must conform the manufacture processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to 

pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

we are subject to laws and regulations and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with certain customers 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts or administrative penalties 

a number of our products from our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies in addition a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income agilents taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

at the end of the 2010 fiscal year we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 26 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 21 billion in senior unsecured notes we also are a party to a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to 330 million we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes other future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions • requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions and stock repurchases and • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

our results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our longterm leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit support on the leasehold transaction fails 

in february 2001 we sold a parcel of surplus land in san jose california for 287 million in cash in august 2001 we completed a likekind exchange by acquiring a longterm leasehold interest in several municipal properties in southern california for a total value of 289 million in 2002 we received 237 million in nonrefundable prepaid rent related to the leasehold interests described above we contracted with a third party to provide credit protection for certain aspects of the transaction including a future bankruptcy of the municipality the current third party insurer is a subsidiary of american international group inc aig which experienced a credit rating downgrade by moodys investors service and standard  poors and has been the recipient of us federal government sponsored loans if the municipality was to become insolvent and the credit support on 

the transaction was to fail our results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although cash generated in the united states covers normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the satisfaction of our ongoing debt obligations including our senior notes coming due in september 2012 the repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of third parties our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our us cash requirements through 1 the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or 2 other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations our production facilities headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november 2001 a securities class action kassin v agilent technologies inc et al civil action no 01cv10639 was filed in united states district court for the southern district of new york the court against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ipo agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the ipo in 2003 the court granted agilents motion to dismiss the claims against agilent based on section 10 of the securities exchange act but denied agilents motion to dismiss the claims based on section 11 of the securities act on june 14 2004 papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the court under the proposed settlement plaintiffs claims against agilent and its directors and officers would be released in exchange for a contingent payment which if made would be paid by agilents insurer and an assignment of certain potential

overview and executive summary 

agilent is the worlds premier measurement company providing core electronic and bioanalytical measurement solutions to the communications electronics life sciences and chemical analysis industries our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

in the first quarter of 2010 we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses the bioanalytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments — life sciences and chemical analysis the electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test which were reported separately in 2009 following this reorganization agilent has three businesses — life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement all historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements 

on may 14 2010 we completed the previously announced acquisition of varian inc varian under the merger agreement dated july 26 2009 the results of varian are included in agilents consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger as part of the european commissions merger approval and the federal trade commission consent order agilent committed to sell varians laboratory gas chromatography gc business varians triple quadrupole gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms business varians inductivelycoupled plasmamass spectrometry icpms business and agilents micro gc business on may 19 2010 we completed the sale of the varian laboratory gc business the triple quadrupole gcms business the icpms business and the agilent micro gc business 

on may 1 2010 we completed the sale of the network solutions division nsd of our electronic measurement business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu a leading communications test and measurement company nsd includes agilents network assurance solutions network protocol test and drive test products 

on february 2 2010 the company sold hycor biomedical inc a whollyowned subsidiary to linden llc a chicagobased healthcare private equity firm hycor is a global manufacturer and marketer of in vitro diagnostics products 

agilents total orders in 2010 were 5744 million an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 agilents total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed 

agilents net revenue of 5444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to the prior year excluding the varian acquisition sales to all endmarkets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 within electronic measurement general purpose endmarkets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses also within electronic measurement the communications test businesses improved in the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless rd and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year agilents total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn 

net income was 684 million in 2010 a net loss of 31 million in 2009 and net income of 693 million in 2008 in 2010 2009 and 2008 we generated operating cash flows of 718 million 408 million and 756 million respectively as of october 31 2010 and 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents balances 2649 million and 2479 million respectively 

our 2009 restructuring program the fy 2009 plan announced in the first half of 2009 was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle workforce reduction payments primarily severance were largely complete in fiscal year 2010 lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014 and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011 as of october 31 2010 a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the fy 2009 plan 

on may 14 2010 we completed our acquisition of varian inc varian a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and chemical analysis market applications by means of a merger of one of our whollyowned subsidiaries with and into varian such that varian became a whollyowned subsidiary of agilent the 15 billion total purchase price of varian included 52 cash per share of varians outstanding common stock including vested and nonvested inthemoney stock options at 52 cash per share less their exercise price varians nonvested restricted stock awards nonvested performance shares at 100 percent of target and nonvested directors stock units were also paid at 52 per share as part of the european commissions merger approval and the federal trade commission consent order agilent committed to sell varians laboratory gas chromatography gc business varians triple quadrupole gas 

chromatographymass spectrometry gcms business varians inductivelycoupled plasmamass spectrometry icpms business and agilents micro gc business on may 19 2010 we completed the sale of the varian laboratory gc business the triple quadrupole gcms business the icpms business and the agilent micro gc business for approximately 33 million we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash the varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of varian are included in agilents consolidated financial statements from the date of merger we expect to realize operational and cost synergies leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources and utilize the assembled workforce the company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs the company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities for additional details related to the acquisition of varian see note 3 acquisition of varian 

looking forward while the economy remains uncertain we continue to see numerous market opportunities and we believe agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them we are focused on integrating varian into agilent throughout fiscal 2011 and our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies as well as drive technology sharing between our businesses we now believe that we will achieve 100 million in net savings as a result of the integration of varian into agilent 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation investment impairments sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer when arrangements include multiple elements we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether 

fair value exists for those elements changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

investment impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our costmethod investments below their cost basis are judged to be otherthantemporary significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is otherthantemporary including the severity and duration of the impairment forecasted recovery the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance under the authoritative guidance sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the blackscholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straightline basis our estimate of sharebased compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility employee exercise patterns expected life of the options future forfeitures and related tax effects we consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted which we believe is representative of future behavior in 2008 we used implied volatility of agilents publicly traded similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards from 2009 we have moved to historical volatility of agilents stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life in reaching this conclusion we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 38 percent to 48 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 22 percent if no other factors were changed 

in the first quarter of 2009 we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 46 years to 44 years in revising this estimate we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in the first quarter of 2009 we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees on average exercise their options at 44 years there was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in 2010 see note 4 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management 

judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date — october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2010 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio for 2009 the us discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value a one percent change in the estimated longterm return on plan assets for 2010 would result in a 5 million impact on us pension expense and a 16 million impact on nonus pension expense 

the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were 82 million in 2010 103 million in 2009 and 15 million in 2008 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement we test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which are formed by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization taking into account an appropriate control premium we then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair 

value calculations based on the income approach estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates operating margins risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 

the circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include but are not limited to the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of a portion of a reporting units goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value 

the results of our test for goodwill impairment as of september 30 2010 showed that the estimated fair values of our life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement reporting units exceeded their carrying values a 1 percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately 15 percent there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended october 31 2010 we continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years in process research and development iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilents consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 

we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of longlived assets including purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess the recoverability of longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2010 and recorded 13 million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions the consolidation of excess facilities asset impairments and special charges related to inventory workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises these estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance we have also assessed the recoverability of our longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 

asset impairments primarily consist of property plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2010 we provided a partial valuation allowance for our us deferred tax assets and either a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in the respective taxing jurisdiction 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated a material impact on income tax expense could result 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring costs asset impairments and other charges 

our 2009 restructuring program the fy 2009 plan announced in the first half of 2009 was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle workforce reduction payments primarily severance were largely complete in fiscal year 2010 lease payments 

should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014 and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011 as of october 31 2010 a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the fy 2009 plan 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term 

results from operations 

orders and net revenue 



  



agilents total orders in 2010 were 5744 million an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009 the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 agilents total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed 

agilents net revenue of 5444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009 the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to the prior year excluding the varian acquisition sales 

to all endmarkets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to 2009 within electronic measurement general purpose endmarkets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year being led by the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses also within electronic measurement the communications test businesses improved in the year ended october 31 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless rd and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year for the year ended october 31 2010 agilents segment revenue was 5463 million an increase of 22 percent when compared to 2009 note 21 shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue 

agilents total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn 

services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting services and other revenue increased 7 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in services and other revenue associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 1 percentage point of revenue increase in 2010 services and other revenue decreased 6 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 with service and other revenue showing signs of relative stability compared with product revenue in 2009 

backlog 

on october 31 2010 our unfilled orders for the life sciences business were approximately 350 million as compared to approximately 210 million at october 31 2009 on october 31 2010 our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately 250 million as compared to approximately 160 million at october 31 2009 on october 31 2010 our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately 830 million as compared to 670 million at october 31 2009 we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months on average our unfilled orders represent approximately three months worth of revenues in light of this experience backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 



in 2010 total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2009 the benefits of business and infrastructure programs lower restructuring costs together with favorable volume impacts offset the unfavorable impact of the varian acquisition including fair value adjustments 

wage restoration higher variable and incentive pay operating margins in 2010 increased 9 percentage points as compared to 2009 

in january 2009 we implemented wage reductions across the company in response to deteriorating economic conditions those wage levels were fully restored to all employees effective november 1 2009 

research and development expenditures have decreased 5 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 increases in expenses due to the varian acquisition wage restoration higher variable and incentive pay were more than offset by the impact of the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses and decreased restructuring expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent during the year increased expenditure was due to the varian acquisition higher variable and incentive pay and wage restoration offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses 

gross inventory charges were 30 million in 2010 54 million in 2009 and 24 million in 2008 sales of previously written down inventory were 5 million in 2010 8 million in 2009 and 6 million in 2008 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct five types of research and development basic research which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future foundation technologies which enables fundamental advances across all businesses communications which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information life sciences which enables nextgeneration pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes and measurement which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies software systems and solutions such as applied mathematics knowledge management and measurement science life sciences such as computational biology molecular diagnostics and highthroughput measurements and photonics such as precision automation technology optical switching and highspeed optical links in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer timehorizon some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20000 products already in production focus on major new product releases and develop new product segments for the future due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense 

for the year ended october 31 2010 we recorded a 132 million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and 54 million of income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with hewlett packard company 

at october 31 2010 our headcount was approximately 18500 compared to 16800 in 2009 and 19600 in 2008 the increase in our headcount in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the varian acquisition the decrease in our headcount in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to our 2009 restructuring program 

provision for income taxes 



for 2010 the annual effective tax rate was 1 percent the 1 percent effective tax rate includes a 101 million beneficial release of the uk valuation allowance a 32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates also included is a 17 million tax benefit related to a 54 million nontaxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard company without considering interest and penalties the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

for 2009 the annual effective tax rate was 543 percent the 543 percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results the tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates in addition net tax benefits totaling 67 million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate without considering interest and penalties the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances 

for 2008 the annual effective tax rate was 15 percent the 15 percent effective tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the us federal and state valuation allowances which results in us tax expense of nearly zero it also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates without considering interest and penalties the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the netherlands puerto rico switzerland the us and the uk where we have recorded valuation allowances 

agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 62 million 14 million and 112 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately 018 004 and 030 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

during 2003 we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis during 2007 we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance during 2008 we maintained a partial us federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our us state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance during 2009 and 2010 we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for us federal and state deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in 2010 after 

consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the uk deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire valuation allowance 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 

on august 31 2010 we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for tax years 2000 through 2002 the adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our statement of operations our us federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 are under audit by the irs in december 2010 we reached an agreement with the irs for tax years 20032005 in addition agilent and the irs reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 20032007 tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 

global infrastructure organization 

agilents global infrastructure organization gio remains a key component of our operating model gio which includes it workplace services human resources legal finance and other corporate functions has reduced its cost structure over the past year in conjunction with the business restructuring that was completed we will continue to efficiently manage and leverage our infrastructure resources to support our businesses in the coming year

agilent is a measurement company providing core bioanalytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences chemical analysis communications and electronics industries agilent has three primary businesses focused on the life sciences market the chemical analysis market and the electronic measurement market 

in the first quarter of 2010 we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses the bioanalytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments — life sciences and chemical analysis the electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test which were reported separately in 2009 following this reorganization agilent has three businesses — life sciences chemical analysis and electronic measurement — each of which comprises a reportable segment the three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance other factors including technology and delivery channels consumerspecific solutions and specialized manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments 

all historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements

gross margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 1 percentage point compared to 2009 changes in 2010 were due to the impact of the varian acquisition wage restoration higher variable pay and incentive pay and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by favorable volume impact gross margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008 as wage reductions lower variable pay lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements were partially offset by lower volume and higher discounts 

research and development expenses in 2010 increased 9 percent compared to 2009 in addition to an increase related to the varian acquisition the increase was due to selective investments in new product introductions wage restoration higher variable pay and incentive pay partially offset by lower shared corporate infrastructure expenses and the impact of the hycor divestiture research and development expenses declined 2 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decline was driven by wage reductions lower variable pay lower global infrastructure costs and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increase in discretionary spending 

selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 20 percent compared to 2009 in addition to increases due to the varian acquisition increases resulted from the establishment and 

staffing of the dedicated life sciences sales channel higher commissions wage restoration higher variable pay and incentive pay and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by the impact of the hycor divestiture selling general and administrative expenses declined 3 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decline was driven by wage reductions lower variable pay lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements 

operating margins for products and services in 2010 increased 1 percentage point compared to 2009 operating margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008 factors which led to operating margin variances for these periods are collectively highlighted in the above discussions on gross margins research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2010 increased by 47 million or 27 percent on a corresponding revenue increase of 260 million the resultant yearoveryear operating margin incremental was 18 percent operating margin incremental is measured by the increase in income compared to prior period from operations divided by the increase in revenue compared to the prior period income from operations in 2009 increased by 8 million or 5 percent compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of 39 million due to the temporary wage and variable pay reduction

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the chemical analysis businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009 and 2009 versus 2008 



gross margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 1 percentage point compared to 2009 the addition of the varian portfolio drove the margin decline other factors impacting gross margins were higher variable pay and incentive pay wage restoration and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses offset by favorable volume impact and currency movements gross margins were relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008 as lower volume and higher discounts were offset by 

wage reductions lower variable pay lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements 

research and development expenses in 2010 increased 36 percent compared to 2009 in addition to an increase related to the varian acquisition the increase was due to wage restoration higher variable pay and incentive pay higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses and higher discretionary spending research and development expenses declined 8 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decline was driven by wage reductions lower variable pay lower discretionary spending and favorable foreign currency movements 

selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 52 percent compared to 2009 in addition to increases due to the varian acquisition increases resulted from increased commissions wage restoration higher variable pay and incentive pay and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses selling general and administrative expenses declined 10 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decline was driven by wage reductions lower variable pay lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements 

operating margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2009 operating margins were relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008 factors which led to operating margin variances for these periods are collectively highlighted in the above discussions on gross margins research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2010 increased by 63 million or 29 percent on a corresponding revenue increase of 356 million the resultant yearoveryear operating margin incremental was 18 percent income from operations in 2009 decreased by 28 million or 12 percent compared to 2008 on a corresponding revenue decrease of 93 million a 30 percent yearoveryear operating margin decremental

our electronic measurement business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems software design tools and related services that are used in the design development manufacture installation deployment and operation of electronics equipment and microscopy products related services include startup assistance instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair we also offer customization consulting and optimization services throughout the customers product lifecycle 

orders and net revenue 



electronic measurement orders increased 25 percent in 2010 a significant improvement from the 31 percent decline in 2009 when overall demand was negatively impacted by broad economic 

weakness foreign currency movements had a slightly favorable impact on the yearoveryear growth rate in our general purpose test business growth was led by improvement in the computers and semiconductor market with solid performance in aerospace and defense and industrial applications in our communications test business strengthening wireless rd and manufacturing related demand was partially offset by a decline in network monitoring associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business on a geographic basis 2010 orders increased 14 percent in the americas 19 percent in europe 29 percent in japan and 45 percent in other asia pacific electronic measurement orders declined 31 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 as order trends deteriorated and then improved with the global economic recovery and strengthening demand particularly in our general purpose segment 

electronic measurement revenues grew 15 percent in 2010 compared to a 32 percent decline in 2009 due to a broadbased recovery across both general purpose and communications test markets foreign currency movements were slightly favorable contributing to the yearoveryear growth in 2010 regionally revenues from the americas increased 8 percent europe grew 12 percent japan improved 7 percent and other asia pacific increased 32 percent compared to 2009 revenue from products increased 20 percent yearoveryear while service related revenue declined as a result of the divestiture of the network solutions business electronic measurement revenues declined 32 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting weakness across general purpose and communications test markets in all geographies 

general purpose test revenues representing approximately 64 percent of electronic measurement revenues reflected strength in the computers and semiconductor business solid growth in aerospace and defense and improvement in demand from industrial customers strength in the computers and semiconductor business reflected the growing demand for cell phones computers and electronics aerospace and defense business growth was consistent with the focus in the united states on improving information management with faster growth in surveillance and intelligence and increased spending in asia overall improvement in economic conditions contributed to more demand from customers with industrial or general purpose applications general purpose test revenues representing approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue in 2009 reflected declines across all market segments with steeper declines in the computer and semiconductor and other general purpose test business 

communications test revenues representing approximately 36 percent of electronic measurement revenues experienced growth in wireless rd and manufacturing test offset partially by a decline in network monitoring business resulting from the divestiture of the network solutions business wireless rd grew as market conditions improved and targeted investments increased for high data rate applications including longterm evolution an emerging wireless standard wireless manufacturing business increased due to strong demand relating to smartphones and 3g expansion performance in other communications test submarket reflected growth in broadband revenues offset by the unfavorable impact of the network solutions divestiture communications test revenues representing approximately 37 percent of electronic measurement revenues in 2009 reflected weakness across all end markets particularly wireless manufacturing 

looking forward we expect growth rates will moderate as a result of comparisons to stronger 2010 results particularly for the general purpose test business we expect continuing demand from our key market segments to support overall growth in the near term subject to continuing economic expansion and stability in the semiconductor industry 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the electronic measurement businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009 and 2009 versus 2008 



gross margins for products and services increased 5 percentage points yearoveryear in 2010 due to higher volume lower cost structure and favorable currency impact volumeadjusted gross margins improved relative to 2009 primarily due to savings from restructuring programs favorable currency impact including hedging gains and lower infrastructure costs which were partially offset by wage restoration and higher variable pay gross margins for products and services declined 4 percentage points yearoveryear in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to the significant decline in revenue 

research and development expenses in 2010 declined 34 million or 8 percent compared to 2009 this decline was driven primarily by savings from restructuring programs lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions of which a portion related to the network solutions business divestiture that were partially offset by wage restoration an increase in variable pay and the unfavorable yearoveryear impact of currency movements research and development expenses in 2009 declined 84 million or 17 percent compared to 2008 due to lower variable pay wage reductions savings from restructuring lower infrastructure costs and the favorable yearoveryear impact of currency movements which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 decreased 71 million or 8 percent compared to 2009 similar to rd yearoveryear reductions in selling general and administrative expenses were driven by savings from restructuring programs lower infrastructure costs and reduced spending partly related to the network solutions business divestiture which were partially offset by wage restoration and higher variable pay unfavorable yearoveryear impact of currency movements and higher commissions selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased 207 million or 19 percent compared to 2008 driven by lower variable pay wage reductions savings from restructuring lower infrastructure costs reduced commissions and the favorable yearoveryear impact of currency movements which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses 

operating margins increased by 16 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the combination of higher revenue volume and structural and operational expense reductions operating margins declined by 13 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower revenue volume that was partially offset by spending reductions 

income from operations 

income from operations increased by 437 million in 2010 compared to 2009 on a revenue increase of 366 million a 119 percent yearoveryear operating margin incremental that reflects the benefit of structural and operational expense reductions the resultant yearoveryear operating margin incremental is expected to moderate going forward as compares are made against relatively stronger 2010 results income from operations declined by 476 million in 2009 compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of 1161 million a 41 percent yearoveryear operating margin decremental as structural and operational expense reductions offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue

credit facility 

on may 11 2007 we entered into a fiveyear credit agreement which provides for a 300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on may 11 2012 on september 8 2009 we entered into an accession agreement increasing the credit facility from 300 million to 330 million the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2010 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility 

shortterm debt 

we currently hold 15 billion of shortterm debt the world trade debt which was refinanced and the repayment date was extended to january 27 2011 we satisfied the financing obligation of world trade in its entirety on december 10 2010 using the proceeds of our senior notes issued in july 2010 and existing cash on our balance sheet 

longterm debt 

on october 24 2007 the company issued an aggregate principal amount of 600 million in senior notes the senior notes were issued at 9960 of their principal amount the notes will mature on november 1 2017 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 650 per annum the interest is payable semiannually on may 1 st and november 1 st of each year and payments commenced on may 1 2008 

on november 25 2008 we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of 400 million the asset value upon termination was approximately 43 million and the amount to be amortized at october 31 2010 was 35 million 

on september 9 2009 agilent issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 750 million a 250 million tranche maturing in 2012 the 2012 notes and a 500 million tranche maturing in 2015 the 2015 notes the 2012 notes were issued at 9991 of their principal 

amount bear interest at a fixed rate of 445 per annum and mature on september 14 2012 the 2015 notes were issued at 9969 of their principal amount bear interest at a fixed rate of 550 per annum and mature on september 14 2015 interest on both tranches is payable semiannually on march 14th and september 14th of each year and payments commenced on march 14 2010

upon the closing of the offering of the 2012 2015 and 2020 senior notes we entered into interest rate swaps for the full aggregate notional amount of the aforementioned tranches 1250 million under the interest rate swaps we will receive fixedrate interest payments and will make payments based on the us dollar libor plus 253 basis points 2576 basis points and 179 basis points with respect to the 2015 2012 and 2020 senior notes respectively the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixedrate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable liborbased interest rate the hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes at october 31 2010 the fair value of the swaps was an asset of 61 million with a corresponding increase in carrying value of the senior notes 

on august 11 2008 a consolidated whollyowned subsidiary of agilent borrowed indian rupees equivalent to 15 million from citibank na to finance a capital project in india on march 30 2010 we paid off this debt completely 

on june 3 2010 as a result of the varian acquisition the company also paid 14 million to satisfy an outstanding term loan of varian with a us financial institution which had a fixed interest rate of 67 the 14 million payment of the term loan included an early termination fee of 2 million 

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2010 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 40 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2010 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 4 million compared to same amount as of october 31 2009 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90day period without significant penalties 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and non us defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2010 or october 31 2009 

on balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to longterm debt in millions 



we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts interest rates and payment dates are detailed in net cash provided by financing activities 

as of october 31 2010 430 million of taxes payable are included in other longterm liabilities we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be paid or released 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2010 62 percent of our revenues in 2009 and 65 percent of our revenues in 2008 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2010 and 2009 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk the interest rate swaps effectively change our fixed interest rate payments to us dollar liborbased variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash cash equivalents and other short term investments by entering into these interest rate swaps we are also hedging the movements in the fair value of the fixedrate debt on our balance sheet however not all of our fixed rate debts fair value is hedged in this manner and in the future we may choose to terminate previously executed swaps 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2010 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt

on february 11 1998 the company through a public offering the “offering” issued 10000000 shares of its 7 3  8  noncumulative exchangeable preferred stock series a the “preferred shares” 100 par value the offering raised 250 million less 79 million of underwriting fees the preferred shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “hbc pr a” holders of preferred shares are entitled to receive if declared by the company’s board of directors noncumulative dividends at a rate of 7 3  8  per annum of the 25 per share liquidation preference an amount equivalent to 18438 per share per annum dividends on the preferred shares if authorized and declared are payable quarterly in arrears on march 30 june 30 september 30 and december 30 of each year provided that if any interest payment date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a business day the interest payment date will be on the following business day the preferred shares may be redeemed for cash at the 

option of the company in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the liquidation preference thereof plus the quarterly accrued and unpaid dividends if any thereon the company may not redeem the preferred shares without prior approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” or the appropriate successor or other federal regulatory agency 

 

each preferred share will be automatically exchanged the “automatic exchange” for one newly issued preferred share of the bank “bank preferred share” in the event i the bank becomes less than “adequately capitalized” under regulations established pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 as amended ii the bank is placed into conservatorship or receivership iii the occ directs such exchange in writing because in its sole discretion and even if the bank is not less than “adequately capitalized” the occ anticipates that the bank may become less than adequately capitalized in the near term or iv the occ in its sole discretion directs in writing an exchange in the event that the bank has a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of less than 5 each an “exchange event” as a result of an exchange event the bank preferred shares would constitute a new series of preferred shares of the bank would have the same dividend rights liquidation preference redemption options and other attributes as the preferred shares except that the bank preferred shares would not be listed on the new york stock exchange and would rank pari passu in terms of cash dividend payments and liquidation preference with any outstanding shares of preferred stock of the bank 

 

effective may 27 2005 harris bankcorp inc the bank’s parent company consolidated 26 of its illinois bank charters including harris trust and savings bank into one national bank charter harris na prior to that time and under the same conditions as described in the prior paragraph each preferred share was automatically exchangeable for one newly issued preferred share of harris trust and savings bank which was subject to regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system references herein to the bank for those times prior to the charter consolidation are intended to refer to its predecessor harris trust and savings bank 

 

concurrent with the issuance of the preferred shares the bank contributed additional capital of 241 million net of acquisition costs to the company the company and the bank undertook the offering for two principal reasons i the qualification of the preferred shares as tier 1 capital of the bank for us banking regulatory purposes under relevant regulatory capital guidelines as a result of the treatment of the preferred shares as a minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary of the bank and ii lack of federal income tax on the company’s earnings used to pay the dividends on the preferred shares as a result of the company’s qualification as a reit on december 30 1998 the bank contributed the common stock of the company to hch a newlyformed and whollyowned subsidiary of the bank the bank is an indirect whollyowned us subsidiary of bank of montreal the bank is required to maintain direct or indirect ownership of at least 80 of the outstanding common stock of the company for as long as any preferred shares are outstanding 

 

the company used the offering proceeds and the additional capital contributed by the bank to purchase 356 million of notes the “notes” from the bank and 135 million of mortgagebacked securities at their estimated fair value the notes are obligations issued by the bank that are recourse only to the underlying mortgage loans the “securing mortgage loans” and were acquired pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement with the bank the principal amount of the notes equals approximately 80 of the principal amounts of the securing mortgage loans 

 

business 

 

the company was formed for the purpose of raising capital for the bank one of the company’s principal business objectives is to acquire hold finance and manage mortgage assets these mortgage assets generate interest income for distribution to stockholders a portion of the mortgage assets of the company consists of notes issued by the bank that are recourse only to securing mortgage loans that are secured by real property the notes mature on october 1 2027 and pay interest at 64 per annum payments of interest are made to the company from payments made on the securing mortgage loans pursuant to an agreement between the company and the bank the company through the bank as agent receives all scheduled payments made on the securing mortgage loans retains a portion of any such payments equal to the amount due on the notes and remits the balance if any to the bank the company also retains approximately 80 of any prepayments of principal in respect of the securing mortgage loans and applies such amounts as a prepayment on the notes the company has a security interest in the 

real property securing the securing mortgage loans and will be entitled to enforce payment on the loans in its own name if a mortgagor should default in the event of such default the company would have the same rights as the original mortgagee to foreclose the mortgaged property and satisfy the obligations of the bank out of the proceeds 

 

the company may from time to time acquire fixedrate or variablerate mortgagebacked securities representing interests in pools of mortgage loans the bank may have originated a portion of any such mortgagebacked securities by exchanging pools of mortgage loans for the mortgagebacked securities the mortgage loans underlying the mortgagebacked securities will be secured by singlefamily residential properties located throughout the united states the company intends to acquire only investment grade mortgagebacked securities issued by agencies of the federal government or government sponsored agencies such as the federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and the government national mortgage association “gnma” the company does not intend to acquire any interestonly principalonly or similar speculative mortgagebacked securities 

 

the bank may from time to time acquire or originate both conforming and nonconforming residential mortgage loans conventional conforming residential mortgage loans comply with the requirements for inclusion in a loan guarantee program sponsored by either fhlmc or fannie mae nonconforming residential mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans that do not qualify in one or more respects for purchase by fannie mae or fhlmc under their standard programs the nonconforming residential mortgage loans that the company purchases will be nonconforming because they have original principal balances which exceed the limits for fhlmc or fannie mae under their standard programs the company believes that all residential mortgage loans will meet the requirements for sale to national private mortgage conduit programs or other investors in the secondary mortgage market as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and for each of the years then ended the company did not directly hold any residential mortgage loans 

 

the company may from time to time acquire commercial mortgage loans secured by industrial and warehouse properties recreational facilities office buildings retail space and shopping malls hotels and motels hospitals nursing homes or senior living centers the company’s current policy is not to acquire any interest in a commercial mortgage loan if commercial mortgage loans would constitute more than 5 of the company’s mortgage assets at the time of its acquisition unlike residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans generally lack standardized terms commercial real estate properties themselves tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties commercial mortgage loans may also not be fully amortizing meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due on maturity moreover commercial properties particularly industrial and warehouse properties are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties generally giving rise to increased costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations there is no requirement regarding the percentage of any commercial real estate property that must be leased at the time the bank acquires a commercial mortgage loan secured by such commercial real estate property and there is no requirement that commercial mortgage loans have third party guarantees the credit quality of a commercial mortgage loan may depend on among other factors the existence and structure of underlying leases the physical condition of the property including whether any maintenance has been deferred the creditworthiness of tenants the historical and anticipated level of vacancies and rents on the property and on other comparable properties located in the same region potential or existing environmental risks the availability of credit to refinance the commercial mortgage loan at or prior to maturity and the local and regional economic climate in general foreclosures of defaulted commercial mortgage loans are generally subject to a number of complicated factors including environmental considerations which are generally not present in foreclosures of residential mortgage loans as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and for each of the years then ended the company did not hold any commercial mortgage loans

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents filed with the sec including the february 5 1998 prospectus the “1998 prospectus” for the offering sec file no 33340257 are risks and uncertainties with respect to the company the preferred shares and the bank this report contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below 

 

declining interest rates will reduce earnings of the company 

 

the company’s income will consist primarily of interest payments on the earning assets held by it if there is a decline in interest rates during a period of time when the company must reinvest payments of interest and principal 

in respect of its earning assets the company may find it difficult to purchase additional earning assets that generate sufficient income to support payment of dividends on the preferred shares 

 

because the rate at which dividends if when and as authorized and declared are payable on the preferred shares is fixed there can be no assurance that an interest rate environment in which there is a decline in interest rates would not adversely affect the company’s ability to pay dividends on the preferred shares 

 

dividends may not be authorized quarterly and dividends not authorized will not be paid 

 

dividends on the preferred shares are not cumulative consequently if the board of directors does not authorize a dividend on the preferred shares for any quarterly period the holders of the preferred shares would not be entitled to recover such dividend whether or not funds are or subsequently become available quarterly dividends may not always be paid on the preferred shares the board of directors may determine in its business judgment that it would be in the best interests of the company to pay less than the full amount of the stated dividend on the preferred shares or no dividend for any quarter notwithstanding that funds are available factors that may be considered by the board of directors in making this determination are the company’s financial condition and capital needs the impact of legislation and regulations as then in effect or as may be proposed economic conditions and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant to remain qualified as a reit the company must distribute annually at least 90 of its “reit taxable income” not including capital gains to stockholders see “tax risks” 

 

automatic exchange for bank preferred shares could occur when value of bank preferred shares is impaired 

 

an investment in the preferred shares involves risk with respect to the performance and capital levels of the bank a decline in the performance and capital levels of the bank or the placement of the bank into conservatorship or receivership could result in the automatic exchange of the preferred shares for bank preferred shares which would be an investment in the bank and not in the company as a result holders of preferred shares would become preferred stockholders of the bank at a time when the bank’s financial condition was deteriorating or when the bank had been placed into conservatorship or receivership if an exchange event occurs the bank would likely be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares 

 

an investment in the bank is also subject to certain risks that are distinct from the risks associated with an investment in the company for example an investment in the bank would involve risks relating to the capital levels of and other federal regulatory requirements applicable to the bank and the performance of the bank’s loan portfolio an investment in the bank is also subject to the general risks inherent in equity investments in depository institutions in the event of a liquidation of the bank the claims of depositors and secured senior general and subordinated creditors of the bank would be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of equity interests such as the bank preferred shares as a result if the bank were to be placed into receivership the holders of the bank preferred shares likely would receive if anything substantially less than they would have received had the preferred shares not been exchanged for bank preferred shares 

 

bank preferred shares will not be listed on any exchange and markets may not be liquid 

 

although the preferred shares are listed on the new york stock exchange the bank does not intend to apply for listing of the bank preferred shares on any national securities exchange consequently there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the trading markets for the bank preferred shares if issued or that an active public market for the bank preferred shares would develop or be maintained 

 

dividends and operations of the company restricted by regulation 

 

because the company is a subsidiary of the bank banking regulatory authorities will have the right to examine the company and its activities under certain circumstances including any determination that the bank’s relationship to the company results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice such regulatory authorities will have the authority to restrict the ability of the company to transfer assets to make distributions to its stockholders including dividends to the holders of preferred shares as described below or to redeem preferred shares or even 

to require the bank to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of the company such actions could potentially result in the company’s failure to qualify as a reit 

 

payment of dividends on the preferred shares could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the bank became less than “adequately capitalized” for purposes of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” less than “adequately capitalized” is currently defined as having i a total riskbased capital ratio of less than 80 ii a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of less than 40 or iii a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 40 or 30 under certain circumstances not currently applicable to the bank at december 31 2008 the bank’s total riskbased capital ratio was 1269 tier 1 riskbased capital ratio was 1057 and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 724 consequently the bank was categorized as “wellcapitalized” by its regulator at december 31 2008 

 

if the automatic exchange occurs the bank would likely be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares in all circumstances following the automatic exchange the bank’s ability to pay dividends would be subject to various restrictions under applicable regulations furthermore in the event the bank is placed into conservatorship or receivership whether before or after the automatic exchange the bank would be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares in addition in the event of a liquidation of the bank the claims of the bank’s depositors and of its secured senior general and subordinated creditors would be entitled to a priority of payment over the dividend and other claims of holders of equity interests such as the bank preferred shares 

 

adverse consequences of failure to qualify as a reit 

 

the company intends to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control may affect the company’s ability to continue to qualify as a reit although the company is not aware of any proposal in congress to amend the tax laws in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to operate as a reit no assurance can be given that new legislation or new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws in the future with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

 

if in any taxable year the company fails to qualify as a reit the company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates as a result the amount available for distribution to the company’s stockholders including the holders of the preferred shares would be reduced for the year or years involved in addition unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions the company would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost a failure of the company to qualify as a reit would not necessarily give the company the right to redeem the preferred shares nor would it give the holders of the preferred shares the right to have their shares redeemed notwithstanding that the company currently intends to operate in a manner designed to enable it to qualify as a reit future economic market legal tax or other considerations may cause the company to determine that it is in the best interest of the company and the holders of its common stock and preferred shares to revoke the reit election as long as any preferred shares are outstanding any such determination by the company may not be made without the approval of a majority of the independent directors the tax law prohibits the company from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year of such revocation 

 

reit requirements with respect to stockholder distributions 

 

to qualify as a reit under the code the company generally will be required each year to distribute as dividends to its stockholders at least 90 of its “reit taxable income” excluding capital gains failure to comply with this requirement would result in the company’s income being subject to tax at regular corporate rates in addition the company will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which certain distributions considered as paid by it with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income for the calendar year 95 of its capital gains net income for the calendar year and any undistributed taxable 

income from prior periods under certain circumstances banking regulatory authorities may restrict the ability of the company as a subsidiary of the bank to make distributions to its stockholders such a restriction could subject the company to federal income and excise tax and result in the company’s failure to meet reit requirements with respect to stockholder distributions 

 

redemption upon occurrence of a tax event 

 

at any time following the occurrence of a tax event as defined under “description of series a preferred shares — redemption” in the 1998 prospectus the company will have the right to redeem the preferred shares in whole but not in part the occurrence of a tax event will not however give the holders of the preferred shares any right to have such shares redeemed 

 

illinois tax law change 

 

beginning january 1 2009 illinois requires a “captive” reit to increase its state taxable income by the amount of dividends paid under this law a captive reit includes a reit of which 50 of the voting power or value of the beneficial interest or shares is owned by a single person management believes that the company would be classified as a “captive” reit under illinois law in light of the fact that 1 all of the company’s outstanding common shares are held by harris capital holdings inc a wholly owned subsidiary of harris na and 2 the company’s common stock represent more than 50 of the voting power of the company’s equity securities and 3 the common stock is not listed for trading on an exchange the current illinois statutory tax rate is 73 management believes that the tax expense incurred by the company beginning january 1 2009 should not have a material adverse effect upon the company’s ability to declare and pay future dividends on the preferred shares this belief is based upon the ownership interest of the company whereby any tax expense incurred is expected to primarily reduce the net earnings available to the holder of our common stock 

 

automatic exchange upon occurrence of the exchange event 

 

upon the occurrence of the exchange event the outstanding preferred shares will be automatically exchanged on a oneforone basis into bank preferred shares assuming as is anticipated to be the case that the bank preferred shares are nonvoting the automatic exchange will be taxable and each holder of preferred shares will have a gain or loss as the case may be measured by the difference between the basis of such holder in the preferred shares and the fair market value of the bank preferred shares received in the automatic exchange assuming that such holder’s preferred shares were held as capital assets prior to the automatic exchange any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss 

 

relationship with the bank and its affiliates conflicts of interest 

 

the bank and its affiliates are involved in virtually every aspect of the company’s existence the bank is the sole holder of the common stock of the company and will administer the daytoday activities of the company in its role as advisor under the advisory agreement the bank will also act as servicer of the mortgage loans on behalf of the company under the servicing agreement in addition other than the independent directors and non bank directors all of the officers and directors of the company are also officers andor directors of the bank andor affiliates of the bank their compensation is paid by the bank and they have substantial responsibilities in connection with their work as officers of the bank as the holder of all of the outstanding voting stock of the company the bank will have the right to elect all directors of the company including the independent directors 

 

the bank and its affiliates may have interests which are not identical to those of the company consequently conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions including without limitation future acquisitions of mortgage assets from the bank andor affiliates of the bank servicing of mortgage loans future dispositions of mortgage assets to the bank and the renewal termination or modification of the advisory agreement or the servicing agreement it is the intention of the company and the bank that any agreements and transactions between the company on the one hand and the bank andor its affiliates on the other hand are fair to all parties and consistent with market terms including prices paid and received for the initial mortgage assets on the acquisition or disposition of mortgage assets by the company or in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans the 

requirement in the terms of the preferred shares that certain actions of the company be approved by a majority of the independent directors is also intended to ensure fair dealings between the company and the bank and its affiliates however there can be no assurance that such agreements or transactions will be on terms as favorable to the company as those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

 

risk of future revisions in policies and strategies by board of directors 

 

the board of directors has established the investment policies and operating policies and strategies of the company all material aspects of which are described in this report these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors in certain circumstances subject to the approval of a majority of the independent directors without a vote of the company’s stockholders including holders of the preferred shares the ultimate effect of any change in the policies and strategies of the company on a holder of preferred shares may be positive or negative 

 

possible leverage 

 

although the company does not currently intend to incur any indebtedness in connection with the acquisition and holding of mortgage assets the company may do so at any time although indebtedness in excess of 25 of the company’s total stockholders’ equity may not be incurred without the approval of a majority of the independent directors of the company to the extent the company were to change its policy with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness the company would be subject to risks associated with leverage including without limitation changes in interest rates and prepayment risk 

 

additional issuances of preferred stock could have dilutive effect 

 

the charter of the company authorizes 20000000 shares of preferred stock 10000000 shares of which have been issued the company could issue additional preferred shares that rank equal to the preferred shares in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on liquidation without the approval of the holders of the preferred shares such future issuances could have the effect of diluting the holders of the preferred shares 

 

risk factors relating to the bank 

 

because of the possibility of the automatic exchange an investment in preferred shares involves a high degree of risk with respect to the performance and capital levels of the bank investors in the preferred shares should carefully consider the following risk factors and other considerations relating to the bank before deciding whether to invest in such shares 

 

possible adverse effects of economic conditions 

 

economic conditions beyond the bank’s control may have a significant impact on the bank’s operations including changes in net interest income examples of such conditions include i the strength of credit demand by customers ii the introduction and growth of new investment instruments and transaction accounts by nonbank financial competitors iii changes in the general level of interest rates including changes resulting from the monetary activities of the board of governors of the federal reserve system iv adverse changes in the economic net worth of loan customers v decline in the general level of employment and vi increased levels of federal government support and equity infusions intended for banks and other commercial enterprises economic growth in the bank’s market areas is dependent upon the local economy adverse changes in the economy of the chicago metropolitan area and other market areas would likely reduce the bank’s growth rate and could otherwise have a negative effect on its business including the demand for new loans the ability of customers to repay loans and the value of the collateral pledged as security additionally current conditions in credit and funding markets serving both corporate and consumer segments have continued to deteriorate thereby causing an acute contraction in the availability of credit as a result of more stringent underwriting standards harris housing sector losses have been residential developers and higher ltv and broker home equities not subprime or alt a the reduction in credit availability has reduced the demand for new and existing homes creating an environment characterized by declining home prices and rising rates of foreclosure a similar credit dynamic has adversely impacted the cost and 

availability of credit to corporate borrowers notably in the highly leveraged lower rated credits the ultimate severity and duration of these developments are subject to considerable uncertainty and the attendant adverse feedback effects could deepen and exacerbate exposures to the general economic risk factors to which the bank is exposed 

 

increase in interest rates may adversely affect operating results 

 

the bank’s operating results depend to a large extent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest the bank receives from its loans securities and other assets and the interest the bank pays on its deposits and other liabilities interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation recession unemployment money supply international disorders and other factors beyond the control of the bank may affect interest rates if generally prevailing interest rates increase the “net interest spread” of the bank which is the difference between the rates of interest earned and the rates of interest paid by the bank is likely to contract resulting in less net interest income the bank’s liabilities generally have shorter terms and are more interestsensitive than its assets there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to adjust its asset and liability positions sufficiently to offset any negative effect of changing market interest rates 

 

competition 

 

the bank faces strong direct competition for deposits loans and other financial services from other commercial banks thrifts credit unions stockbrokers and finance divisions of auto and farm equipment companies some of the competitors are local while others are statewide or nationwide several major multibank holding companies currently operate in the chicago metropolitan area some of these financial institutions are larger than the bank and have greater access to capital and other resources some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which the bank competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as that imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured statechartered banks and national banks as a result such nonbank competitors have advantages over the bank in providing certain services the banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition to better serving customers the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs the bank’s future success will depend in part on its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in the bank’s operations some of the bank’s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to effectively implement such products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to its customers 

 

government regulation 

 

the bank is subject to extensive federal and state legislation regulation and supervision recently enacted proposed and future legislation and regulations have had will continue to have or may have significant impact on the financial services industry some of the legislative and regulatory changes may benefit the bank others however may increase its costs of doing business and assist competitors of the bank there can be no assurance that state or federal regulators will not in the future impose further restriction or limits on the bank’s activities

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 totaled 597 thousand compared to 437 thousand a year ago loan servicing expenses for 2008 totaled 15 thousand a decrease of 3 thousand from 2007 this decrease was attributable to the reduction in the principal balance of the notes advisory fees for the year ended december 31 2008 were 208 thousand compared to 119 thousand a 75 increase from 2007 primarily due to increased costs for processing and management services general and administrative expenses totaled 374 thousand for 2008 and 300 thousand for 2007 a 25 increase from 2007 primarily as a result of increased costs for printing and insurance

company made the election under internal revenue code section 85769 to treat the dividend paid on january 4 2008 as paid on december 31 2007 

 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 there were no securing mortgage loans on nonaccrual status and there was no allowance for loan losses 

 

quarter ended december 31 2008 compared to quarter ended december 31 2007 

 

the company’s net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 51 million compared to 53 million for the same period in 2007 

 

interest income on securities availableforsale for the current quarter was 51 million resulting in a yield of 46 on an average balance of 447 million compared to interest income of 43 million with a yield of 45 on an average balance of 383 million for the same period a year ago interest income on securities purchased under agreement to resell for the current quarter was 53 thousand on an average balance of 40 million resulting in an average yield of 05 compared to interest income of 11 million on an average balance of 101 million with an average yield of 43 for the same period in the yearago quarter

fourth quarter 2008 operating expenses totaled 193 thousand an increase of 54 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2007 advisory fees for the fourth quarter of 2008 were 54 thousand compared to 16 thousand in the prior year’s fourth quarter due to increased costs for investment advisory services and administration general and administrative expenses totaled 136 thousand in the current quarter compared to 119 thousand for the same period in 2007 reflecting increased costs for printing legal and expert services 

 

allowance for loan losses 

 

the company does not currently maintain an allowance for loan losses due to the overcollateralization of the securing mortgage loans and the prior and expected credit performance of the collateral pool and because the company can under certain conditions require the bank to dispose of nonperforming mortgage loans 

 

concentrations of credit risk 

 

the mbs portfolio securities currently held by the company are all various issues of federal agency guaranteed conventional passthrough securities the credit guarantees extended by the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage association are characterized as full modification guarantees whereby the timely payment of both interest and principal is assured by the respective sponsoring federal agency 

 

a majority of the collateral underlying the securing mortgage loans is located in illinois the financial viability of customers in this state is in part dependent on the state’s economy the collateral may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable loans in the event of adverse economic political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect such region and the ability of property owners in such region to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages the company’s maximum risk of accounting loss should all customers in illinois fail to perform according to contract terms and all collateral prove to be worthless was approximately 32 million at december 31 2008 and 44 million at december 31 2007 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company’s income consists primarily of interest payments on the mortgage assets and the securities it holds if there is a decline in interest rates during a period of time when the company must reinvest payments of interest and principal with respect to its mortgage assets and other interest earning assets the company may find it difficult to purchase additional earning assets that generate sufficient income to support payment of dividends on the preferred shares because the rate at which dividends if when and as authorized and declared are payable on the preferred shares is fixed there can be no assurance that an interest rate environment in which there is a decline in interest rates would not adversely affect the company’s ability to pay dividends on the preferred shares 

competition 

 

the company does not engage in the business of originating mortgage loans while the company may acquire additional mortgage assets it anticipates that such assets will be acquired from the bank affiliates of the bank or unaffiliated parties accordingly the company does not expect to compete with mortgage conduit programs investment banking firms savings and loan associations banks thrift and loan associations finance companies mortgage bankers or insurance companies in originating mortgage assets 

 

liquidity risk management 

 

the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all of the company’s financial commitments in managing liquidity the company takes into account various legal limitations placed on a reit 

 

the company’s principal liquidity needs are to maintain the current portfolio size through the acquisition of additional qualifying assets and to pay dividends to its stockholders after satisfying obligations to creditors the acquisition of additional qualifying assets is funded with the proceeds obtained from repayment of principal balances by individual mortgages or maturities of securities held for sale on a reinvested basis the payment of dividends on the preferred shares will be made from legally available funds principally arising from operating activities of the company the company’s cash flows from operating activities principally consist of the collection of interest on short term qualifying investments the notes and mortgagebacked securities the company does not have and does not anticipate having any material capital expenditures 

 

in order to remain qualified as a reit the company must distribute annually at least 90 of its adjusted reit ordinary taxable income as provided for under the code to its common and preferred stockholders the company currently expects to distribute dividends annually equal to 90 or more of its adjusted reit ordinary taxable income 

 

the company anticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash flow from the notes shortterm investments and mortgagebacked securities will provide adequate liquidity for its operating investing and financing needs including the capacity to continue preferred dividend payments on an uninterrupted basis in addition the company believes that the recent march 2009 80 million capital contribution from the company’s parent should provide additional opportunity to invest in earning assets 

 

as presented in the accompanying statement of cash flows the primary sources of funds in addition to 203 million provided from operations during 2008 were 2578 million from the maturities and sales of securities availableforsale in 2007 the primary sources of funds other than 222 million provided from operations were 3606 million from the maturities and sales of securities availableforsale the primary uses of funds for 2008 were 2652 million in purchases of securities availableforsale and 11 million of sales proceeds from securities purchased from harris na under agreement to resell and 184 million and 56 million in preferred share dividends and common stock dividends paid respectively in 2007 the primary uses of funds were 3587 million in purchases of securities availableforsale and 23 million and 511 thousand in preferred stock dividends and common stock dividends paid respectively

each preferred share will be automatically exchanged the “automatic exchange” for one newly issued preferred share of the bank “bank preferred share” in the event i the bank becomes less than “adequately capitalized” under regulations established pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 as amended ii the bank is placed into conservatorship or receivership iii the occ directs such exchange in writing because in its sole discretion and even if the bank is not less than “adequately capitalized” the 

  occ anticipates that the bank may become less than adequately capitalized in the near term or iv the occ in its sole discretion directs in writing an exchange in the event that the bank has a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of less than 5 each an “exchange event” as a result of an exchange event the bank preferred shares would constitute a new series of preferred shares of the bank would have the same dividend rights liquidation preference redemption options and other attributes as the preferred shares except that the bank preferred shares would not be listed on the new york stock exchange and would rank pari passu in terms of cash dividend payments and liquidation preference with any outstanding shares of preferred stock of the bank

concurrent with the issuance of the preferred shares the bank contributed additional capital of 241 million net of acquisition costs to the company the company and the bank undertook the offering for two principal reasons i the qualification of the preferred shares as tier 1 capital of the bank for us banking regulatory purposes under relevant regulatory capital guidelines as a result of the treatment of the preferred shares as a minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary of the bank and ii lack of federal income tax on the company’s earnings used to pay the dividends on the preferred shares as a result of the company’s qualification as a reit on december 30 1998 the bank contributed the common stock of the company to hch a newlyformed and whollyowned subsidiary of the bank the bank is an indirect whollyowned us subsidiary of bank of montreal the bank is required to maintain direct or indirect ownership of at least 80 of the outstanding common stock of the company for as long as any preferred shares are outstanding 

 

the company used the offering proceeds and the additional capital contributed by the bank to purchase 356 million of notes the “notes” from the bank and 135 million of mortgagebacked securities at their estimated fair value the notes are obligations issued by the bank that are recourse only to the underlying mortgage loans the “securing mortgage loans” and were acquired pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement with the bank the principal amount of the notes equals approximately 80 of the principal amounts of the securing mortgage loans

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents filed with the sec including the february 5 1998 prospectus the “1998 prospectus” for the offering sec file no 33340257 are risks and uncertainties with respect to the company the preferred shares and the bank this report contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below 

 

declining interest rates will reduce earnings of the company 

 

the company’s income will consist primarily of interest payments on the earning assets held by it if there is a decline in interest rates during a period of time when the company must reinvest payments of interest and principal in respect of its earning assets the company may find it difficult to purchase additional earning assets that generate sufficient income to support payment of dividends on the preferred shares 

 

because the rate at which dividends if when and as authorized and declared are payable on the preferred shares is fixed there can be no assurance that an interest rate environment in which there is a decline in interest rates would not adversely affect the company’s ability to pay dividends on the preferred shares 

 

dividends may not be authorized quarterly and dividends not authorized will not be paid 

 

dividends on the preferred shares are not cumulative consequently if the board of directors does not authorize a dividend on the preferred shares for any quarterly period the holders of the preferred shares would not be entitled to recover such dividend whether or not funds are or subsequently become available quarterly dividends may not always be paid on the preferred shares the board of directors may determine in its business judgment that it would be in the best interests of the company to pay less than the full amount of the stated dividend on the preferred shares or no dividend for any quarter notwithstanding that funds are available factors that may be considered by the board of directors in making this determination are the company’s financial condition and capital needs the impact of legislation and regulations as then in effect or as may be proposed economic conditions and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant to remain qualified as a reit the company must distribute annually at least 90 of its “reit taxable income” not including capital gains to stockholders see “tax risks” 

 

automatic exchange for bank preferred shares could occur when value of bank preferred shares is impaired 

 

an investment in the preferred shares involves risk with respect to the performance and capital levels of the bank a decline in the performance and capital levels of the bank or the placement of the bank into conservatorship or receivership could result in the automatic exchange of the preferred shares for bank preferred shares which would be an investment in the bank and not in the company as a result holders of preferred shares would become 

  preferred stockholders of the bank at a time when the bank’s financial condition was deteriorating or when the bank had been placed into conservatorship or receivership if an exchange event occurs the bank would likely be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares 

 

an investment in the bank is also subject to certain risks that are distinct from the risks associated with an investment in the company for example an investment in the bank would involve risks relating to the capital levels of and other federal regulatory requirements applicable to the bank and the performance of the bank’s loan portfolio an investment in the bank is also subject to the general risks inherent in equity investments in depository institutions in the event of a liquidation of the bank the claims of depositors and secured senior general and subordinated creditors of the bank would be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of equity interests such as the bank preferred shares as a result if the bank were to be placed into receivership the holders of the bank preferred shares likely would receive if anything substantially less than they would have received had the preferred shares not been exchanged for bank preferred shares 

 

bank preferred shares will not be listed on any exchange and markets may not be liquid 

 

although the preferred shares are listed on the new york stock exchange the bank does not intend to apply for listing of the bank preferred shares on any national securities exchange consequently there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the trading markets for the bank preferred shares if issued or that an active public market for the bank preferred shares would develop or be maintained 

 

dividends and operations of the company restricted by regulation 

 

because the company is a subsidiary of the bank banking regulatory authorities will have the right to examine the company and its activities under certain circumstances including any determination that the bank’s relationship to the company results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice such regulatory authorities will have the authority to restrict the ability of the company to transfer assets to make distributions to its stockholders including dividends to the holders of preferred shares as described below or to redeem shares of preferred stock or even to require the bank to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of the company such actions could potentially result in the company’s failure to qualify as a reit 

 

payment of dividends on the preferred shares could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the bank became less than “adequately capitalized” for purposes of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” less than “adequately capitalized” is currently defined as having i a total riskbased capital ratio of less than 80 ii a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of less than 40 or iii a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 40 or 30 under certain circumstances not currently applicable to the bank at december 31 2007 the bank’s total riskbased capital ratio was 1266 tier 1 riskbased capital ratio was 1066 and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 841 

 

if the automatic exchange occurs the bank would likely be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares in all circumstances following the automatic exchange the bank’s ability to pay dividends would be subject to various restrictions under applicable regulations furthermore in the event the bank is placed into conservatorship or receivership whether before or after the automatic exchange the bank would be unable to pay dividends on the bank preferred shares in addition in the event of a liquidation of the bank the claims of the bank’s depositors and of its secured senior general and subordinated creditors would be entitled to a priority of payment over the dividend and other claims of holders of equity interests such as the bank preferred shares 

 

adverse consequences of failure to qualify as a reit 

 

the company intends to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control may affect the company’s ability to continue to qualify as a reit although the company is not aware of any proposal in congress to amend the tax laws in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to operate as a reit no assurance can be given that new legislation or new regulations 

  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws in the future with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

 

if in any taxable year the company fails to qualify as a reit the company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates as a result the amount available for distribution to the company’s stockholders including the holders of the preferred shares would be reduced for the year or years involved in addition unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions the company would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost a failure of the company to qualify as a reit would not necessarily give the company the right to redeem the preferred shares nor would it give the holders of the preferred shares the right to have their shares redeemed notwithstanding that the company currently intends to operate in a manner designed to enable it to qualify as a reit future economic market legal tax or other considerations may cause the company to determine that it is in the best interest of the company and the holders of its common stock and preferred stock to revoke the reit election as long as any preferred shares are outstanding any such determination by the company may not be made without the approval of a majority of the independent directors the tax law prohibits the company from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year of such revocation 

 

reit requirements with respect to stockholder distributions 

 

to qualify as a reit under the code the company generally will be required each year to distribute as dividends to its stockholders at least 90 of its “reit taxable income” excluding capital gains failure to comply with this requirement would result in the company’s income being subject to tax at regular corporate rates in addition the company will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which certain distributions considered as paid by it with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income for the calendar year 95 of its capital gains net income for the calendar year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods under certain circumstances banking regulatory authorities may restrict the ability of the company as a subsidiary of the bank to make distributions to its stockholders such a restriction could subject the company to federal income and excise tax and result in the company’s failure to meet reit requirements with respect to stockholder distributions 

 

redemption upon occurrence of a tax event 

 

at any time following the occurrence of a tax event as defined under “description of series a preferred shares — redemption” in the 1998 prospectus the company will have the right to redeem the preferred shares in whole but not in part the occurrence of a tax event will not however give the holders of the preferred shares any right to have such shares redeemed 

 

recent illinois tax law change 

 

in 2007 illinois enacted legislation that requires a “captive” reit to increase its state taxable income by the amount of dividends paid this law becomes effective january 1 2009 under this law a captive reit includes a reit of which more than 50 of the voting power or value of the beneficial interest or shares is owned by a us corporation management is reviewing the application of this legislation to the company and the impact to the company’s future net earnings management believes that any tax expense incurred by the reit should not have a material adverse effect upon the company’s ability to declare and pay future dividends on the preferred stock this belief reflects the interaction of the legislation with the ownership interests of the company whereby any tax expense incurred is expected to primarily reduce the net earnings available to the common stockholder 

 

automatic exchange upon occurrence of the exchange event 

 

upon the occurrence of the exchange event the outstanding preferred shares will be automatically exchanged on a oneforone basis into bank preferred shares assuming as is anticipated to be the case that the bank preferred shares are nonvoting the automatic exchange will be taxable and each holder of preferred shares will have a gain or loss as the case may be measured by the difference between the basis of such holder in the preferred 

  shares and the fair market value of the bank preferred shares received in the automatic exchange assuming that such holder’s preferred shares were held as capital assets prior to the automatic exchange any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss 

 

relationship with the bank and its affiliates conflicts of interest 

 

the bank and its affiliates are involved in virtually every aspect of the company’s existence the bank is the sole holder of the common stock of the company and will administer the daytoday activities of the company in its role as advisor under the advisory agreement the bank will also act as servicer of the mortgage loans on behalf of the company under the servicing agreement in addition other than the independent directors all of the officers and directors of the company are also officers andor directors of the bank andor affiliates of the bank their compensation is paid by the bank and they have substantial responsibilities in connection with their work as officers of the bank as the holder of all of the outstanding voting stock of the company the bank will have the right to elect all directors of the company including the independent directors 

 

the bank and its affiliates may have interests which are not identical to those of the company consequently conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions including without limitation future acquisitions of mortgage assets from the bank andor affiliates of the bank servicing of mortgage loans future dispositions of mortgage assets to the bank and the renewal termination or modification of the advisory agreement or the servicing agreement it is the intention of the company and the bank that any agreements and transactions between the company on the one hand and the bank andor its affiliates on the other hand are fair to all parties and consistent with market terms including prices paid and received for the initial mortgage assets on the acquisition or disposition of mortgage assets by the company or in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans the requirement in the terms of the preferred shares that certain actions of the company be approved by a majority of the independent directors is also intended to ensure fair dealings between the company and the bank and its affiliates however there can be no assurance that such agreements or transactions will be on terms as favorable to the company as those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

 

risk of future revisions in policies and strategies by board of directors 

 

the board of directors has established the investment policies and operating policies and strategies of the company all material aspects of which are described in this report these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors in certain circumstances subject to the approval of a majority of the independent directors without a vote of the company’s stockholders including holders of the preferred shares the ultimate effect of any change in the policies and strategies of the company on a holder of preferred shares may be positive or negative 

 

possible leverage 

 

although the company does not currently intend to incur any indebtedness in connection with the acquisition and holding of mortgage assets the company may do so at any time although indebtedness in excess of 25 of the company’s total stockholders’ equity may not be incurred without the approval of a majority of the independent directors of the company to the extent the company were to change its policy with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness the company would be subject to risks associated with leverage including without limitation changes in interest rates and prepayment risk 

 

additional issuances of preferred stock could have dilutive effect 

 

the charter of the company authorizes 20000000 shares of preferred stock 10000000 shares of which have been issued the company could issue additional preferred shares that rank equal to the preferred shares in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on liquidation without the approval of the holders of the preferred shares such future issuances could have the effect of diluting the holders of the preferred shares 

  risk factors relating to the bank 

 

because of the possibility of the automatic exchange an investment in preferred shares involves a high degree of risk with respect to the performance and capital levels of the bank investors in the preferred shares should carefully consider the following risk factors and other considerations relating to the bank before deciding whether to invest in such shares 

 

possible adverse effects of economic conditions 

 

economic conditions beyond the bank’s control may have a significant impact on the bank’s operations including changes in net interest income examples of such conditions include i the strength of credit demand by customers ii the introduction and growth of new investment instruments and transaction accounts by nonbank financial competitors and iii changes in the general level of interest rates including changes resulting from the monetary activities of the board of governors of the federal reserve system economic growth in the bank’s market areas is dependent upon the local economy adverse changes in the economy of the chicago metropolitan area and other market areas would likely reduce the bank’s growth rate and could otherwise have a negative effect on its business including the demand for new loans the ability of customers to repay loans and the value of the collateral pledged as security additionally current conditions in credit and funding markets serving both corporate and consumer segments have continued to deteriorate thereby causing an acute contraction in the availability of credit as a result of more stringent underwriting standards the residential housing sector has been notably affected by losses concentrated within subprime mortgages and socalled “alt a” mortgages with nonconforming documentation requirements the reduction in credit availability has reduced the demand for new and existing homes creating an environment characterized by declining home prices and rising rates of foreclosure a similar credit dynamic has adversely impacted the cost and availability of credit to corporate borrowers notably in the highly leveraged lower rated credits the ultimate severity and duration of these developments are subject to considerable uncertainty and the attendant adverse feedback effects could deepen and exacerbate exposures to the general economic risk factors to which the bank is exposed 

 

increase in interest rates may adversely affect operating results 

 

the bank’s operating results depend to a large extent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest the bank receives from its loans securities and other assets and the interest the bank pays on its deposits and other liabilities interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation recession unemployment money supply international disorders and other factors beyond the control of the bank may affect interest rates if generally prevailing interest rates increase the “net interest spread” of the bank which is the difference between the rates of interest earned and the rates of interest paid by the bank is likely to contract resulting in less net interest income the bank’s liabilities generally have shorter terms and are more interestsensitive than its assets there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to adjust its asset and liability positions sufficiently to offset any negative effect of changing market interest rates 

 

competition 

 

the bank faces strong direct competition for deposits loans and other financial services from other commercial banks thrifts credit unions stockbrokers and finance divisions of auto and farm equipment companies some of the competitors are local while others are statewide or nationwide several major multibank holding companies currently operate in the chicago metropolitan area many of these financial institutions are larger than the bank and have greater access to capital and other resources some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which the bank competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as that imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured statechartered banks and national banks as a result such nonbank competitors have advantages over the bank in providing certain services the banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition to better serving customers the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs the bank’s future success will depend in part on its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for 

  convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in the bank’s operations many of the bank’s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to effectively implement such products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to its customers 

 

government regulation 

 

the bank is subject to extensive federal and state legislation regulation and supervision recently enacted proposed and future legislation and regulations have had will continue to have or may have significant impact on the financial services industry some of the legislative and regulatory changes may benefit the bank others however may increase its costs of doing business and assist competitors of the bank there can be no assurance that state or federal regulators will not in the future impose further restriction or limits on the bank’s activities

allowance for loan losses 

 

the company does not currently maintain an allowance for loan losses due to the overcollateralization of the securing mortgage loans and the prior and expected credit performance of the collateral pool and because the company can under certain conditions require the bank to dispose of nonperforming mortgage loans 

 

concentrations of credit risk 

 

a majority of the collateral underlying the securing mortgage loans is located in illinois the financial viability of customers in this state is in part dependent on the state’s economy the collateral may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable loans in the event of adverse economic political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect such region and the ability of property owners in such region to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages the company’s maximum risk of accounting loss should all customers in illinois fail to perform according to contract terms and all collateral prove to be worthless was approximately 44 million at december 31 2007 and 50 million at december 31 2006 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the company’s income consists primarily of interest payments on the mortgage assets and the securities it holds if there is a decline in interest rates during a period of time when the company must reinvest payments of interest and principal with respect to its mortgage assets and other interest earning assets the company may find it difficult to purchase additional earning assets that generate sufficient income to support payment of dividends on the preferred shares because the rate at which dividends if when and as authorized and declared are payable on the preferred shares is fixed there can be no assurance that an interest rate environment in which there is a decline in interest rates would not adversely affect the company’s ability to pay dividends on the preferred shares 

 

competition 

 

the company does not engage in the business of originating mortgage loans while the company may acquire additional mortgage assets it anticipates that such assets will be acquired from the bank affiliates of the bank or unaffiliated parties accordingly the company does not expect to compete with mortgage conduit programs investment banking firms savings and loan associations banks thrift and loan associations finance companies mortgage bankers or insurance companies in originating mortgage assets 

  liquidity risk management 

 

the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all of the company’s financial commitments in managing liquidity the company takes into account various legal limitations placed on a reit 

 

the company’s principal liquidity needs are to maintain the current portfolio size through the acquisition of additional qualifying assets and to pay dividends to its stockholders after satisfying obligations to creditors the acquisition of additional qualifying assets is funded with the proceeds obtained from repayment of principal balances by individual mortgages or maturities of securities held for sale on a reinvested basis the payment of dividends on the preferred shares will be made from legally available funds principally arising from operating activities of the company the company’s cash flows from operating activities principally consist of the collection of interest on short term qualifying investments the notes and mortgagebacked securities the company does not have and does not anticipate having any material capital expenditures 

 

in order to remain qualified as a reit the company must distribute annually at least 90 of its adjusted reit ordinary taxable income as provided for under the code to its common and preferred stockholders the company currently expects to distribute dividends annually equal to 90 or more of its adjusted reit ordinary taxable income 

 

the company anticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash flow from the notes shortterm investments and mortgagebacked securities will provide adequate liquidity for its operating investing and financing needs including the capacity to continue preferred dividend payments on an uninterrupted basis 

 

as presented in the accompanying statement of cash flows the primary sources of funds in addition to 222 million provided from operations during 2007 were 3606 million from the maturities and sales of securities availableforsale in 2006 the primary sources of funds other than 208 million provided from operations were 4057 million from the maturities and sales of securities availableforsale the primary uses of funds for 2007 were 3587 million in purchases of securities availableforsale and 23 million and 511 thousand in preferred stock dividends and common stock dividends paid respectively in 2006 the primary uses of funds were 4183 million in purchases of securities availableforsale 138 and 26 million in preferred stock dividends and common stock dividends paid respectively

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

as of december 31 2007 the company had 53 million invested in notes a decrease of 12 million from december 31 2006 the decline was attributable to customer payoffs in the securing mortgage loans at december 31 2007 the company held 369 million in mortgagebacked securities compared to 404 million at december 31 2006 at december 31 2007 the company held 100 million in us treasuries compared to 60 million at december 31 2006 at december 31 2007 the company held an investment of 165 million in securities purchased from the bank under agreement to resell compared to 99 million at december 31 2006 the company is subject to exposure for fluctuations in interest rates adverse changes in interest rates could impact negatively the value of mortgagebacked securities as well as the levels of interest income to be derived from these assets 

 

the company’s investments held in mortgagebacked securities are secured by adjustable and fixed interest rate residential mortgage loans the yield to maturity on each security depends on among other things the price at which each such security is purchased the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments repurchases defaults and liquidations the passthrough rate and interest rate fluctuations changes in interest rates could impact prepayment rates as well as default rates which in turn would impact the value and yield to maturity of the company’s mortgagebacked securities 

 

the company currently has no outstanding borrowings

competition 

there is significant competition in the markets in which sequa operates and in several cases the competition consists of larger companies having substantially greater resources than sequa

chromalloy is a leader in the development and use of advanced metallurgical and other processes to repair manufacture and coat blades vanes and other components of gas turbine engines used for commercial and military jet aircraft chromalloys divisions compete for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the manufacturers of jet engines oems in certain cases oems have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements that allow it to repair certain components of engines the loss of approval by one of the major oems to repair components for such oems engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to it to mitigate this effect chromalloy competes on technical expertise and price

arc automotive is a secondtier supplier of airbag inflators for firsttier airbag module airbag inflator and covers suppliers certain of whom have their own inflator capabilities the unit competes on the basis of product capability quality and price casco products is believed by sequa to be the worlds leading producer of cigarette lighters for both the original equipment market and the auto aftermarket and produces various electronic monitoring devices casco products competes on the basis of price quality and customer service

precoat is a leading independent domestic coater of coiled steel for metal building panels precoat competes in all its markets based on price quality customer service and technical capabilities

warwick competes in each of its markets with several other manufacturers one of which is larger and has greater resources warwick competes in the detergent additive market on the basis of the breadth of product offerings as well as performance quality and price the european chemical distribution units compete primarily on the technical expertise of the sales force and the breadth of product offerings

megtec systems is a major international supplier of air flotation dryers emission control equipment and auxiliary press equipment this operation has several major competitors in each of its main product areas including certain press manufacturers in the graphic arts market it competes on the basis of price quality and technical capabilities

after six competes on the basis of design quality and price and sequa believes it is a leader in mens formalwear

raw materials 

sequas businesses use a wide variety of raw materials and supplies generally these have been available in sufficient quantities to meet requirements although occasional shortages have occurred 

throughout 2004 and the first half of 2005 domestic steel was in short supply and steel prices increased significantly due to a weak us dollar which makes imported products more expensive consolidation among us steel manufacturers and increased demand for steel particularly in the chinese market which also caused shortages of the raw materials used in steel production the situation caused production volatility at precoat and modestly affected the manufacturing units of sequa that incorporate significant amounts of steel in their products  arc automotive and casco products of the automotive segment and megtec systems industrial machinery segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 imports of foreign steel began to offset the domestic shortage with such impact increasing to the point whereby the second half of 2005 and 2006 reflect a more typical seasonal pattern of availability 

precoat uses natural gas to fire the curing ovens used in the coating process as well as emission control devices depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of precoats natural gas requirements to fixed rates at december 31 2006 there was one natural gas swap contract outstanding for 100000 mmbtu which settled in january 2007 

seasonal factors 

with the exception of the after six unit which has stronger sales in the first six months of the year sequas businesses are not seasonal to any significant extent

patents and trademarks 

sequa owns and is licensed to manufacture and sell under a number of patents including patents relating to its metallurgical processes these patents and licenses were secured over a period of years and expire at various times sequa has also created and acquired a number of trade names and trademarks while sequa believes its patents patent licenses trade names and trademarks are valuable it does not consider the businesses comprising its segments to be materially dependent upon any particular patent license trade name or trademark sequa regards its technical and managerial knowledge and experience as more important to its business

sequa has been notified that it has been named as a potentially responsible party under federal and state superfund laws andor has been named as a defendant in suits by private parties or governmental suits including private parties as codefendants with respect to sites currently or previously owned or operated by sequa or its predecessors or to which sequa or its predecessors may have sent hazardous wastes sequa is not presently aware of other such lawsuits or notices contemplated or planned by any private parties or environmental enforcement agencies the aggregate liability with respect to these matters net of liabilities already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet will not in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the financial position of sequa although adjustments to estimates based on improved knowledge of site conditions and chemical interactions with humans or changes in environmental law could have a significant impact on sequas results of operations in a particular period these environmental matters include the following

two propellant manufacturing facilities of the divested arc propulsion business have been identified to have soil and groundwater ammonium perchlorate “ap” contamination above the limit currently proposed by the us environmental protection agency “epa” for groundwater ap is a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel in 2001 sequa recorded an environmental charge that included 97 million of estimated costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ap with respect to the discontinued operation of the arc propulsion business aerojet which purchased the arc propulsion business in october 2003 has among other things assumed financial responsibility for future ap remediation at one facility camden arkansas arc is responsible for ap remediation at the second facility gainesville virginia and is using an emerging technology biodegradation to treat apaffected soil and groundwater sequa recorded an additional 08 million charge in 2006 and a 10 million charge in 2004 with respect to environmental cleanup matters associated with the site sequa has placed its insurance carriers on notice of a claim with respect to the ap contamination and sequas present accruals do not consider possible recoveries from such carriers aerojets exposure to acquired arc propulsion environmental remediation costs  ap and other contamination associated with arcs prior operation of the business  is capped at 200 million after which arc is responsible for such costs based on its most recent estimates sequa believes that the costs to remediate the arc propulsion contamination exposures will not exceed the 200 million cap of financial responsibility assumed by aerojet

a number of claims have been filed in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in the vicinity of a predecessor corporation site which operated during the 1960s and early 1970s in dublin pennsylvania in october 1987 a class action was filed by residents of dublin against sequa and two other defendants the borough of dublin also filed suit seeking remediation of alleged contamination of the boroughs water supply and damages in an unspecified amount a settlement was reached in the class action in which sequa paid 18 million in 1997 the borough action was settled in 1998 when sequa paid 20 million to the borough and agreed to transfer to the borough the water treatment system it constructed the pennsylvania department of environmental protection entered into a consent decree with sequa in 1990 providing for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study with respect to the same alleged groundwater contamination in dublin the epa placed the site on the superfund list in 1990 and in conjunction therewith entered into a consent agreement with sequa on december 31 1990 sequa completed the requirements of the december 31 1990 consent agreement and subsequently entered a final consent decree for remedial design and remedial action “rdra consent decree” for the site sequa is currently implementing the rdra consent decree for the site which is expected to take several years

the state of florida issued an administrative order in 1988 requiring turbocombustor technology tct a subsidiary of chromalloy to investigate and take appropriate corrective action in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in stuart florida the contamination is alleged to have arisen from a 1985 fire at tcts former facility in stuart the city of stuart subsequently constructed and is operating a groundwater remediation system sequa negotiated a conditional settlement with the city of stuart in october 1994 whereby it would contribute its pro rata share of the capital and operating costs for the groundwater treatment system on february 14 2000 the stuart city commission approved the execution of the settlement sequa estimates the amount to be paid in settlement plus additional groundwater sampling and analysis will be approximately 2 million to be paid over a tenyear period that began in the second quarter of 2000 in connection with the sale of tct in 2004 sequa agreed to retain this liability

in september 1993 14 homeowners in west nyack new york served a complaint on chromalloy and others alleging among other things that contamination from a former chromalloy site caused damage to their property all 14 homeowners agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in november 2002 the case was subsequently dismissed by the court chromalloy entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation on february 14 1994 to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study relating to the contamination in the vicinity of the former chromalloy site based on the findings of the study a dual phase extraction remedial system was started up in january 2003 it is scheduled to operate for five years

in june 2006 sequa received a general notice of liability letter from the epa region ii in connection with a study into the impact of wastewater from several manufacturing facilities potentially including a former sequa manufacturing site on a portion of the passaic river in july 2006 sequa agreed to join the cooperating parties group in connection with this matter and submitted a letter of intent to the epa indicating that sequa will participate along with the other cooperating parties in conducting the study the study will be conducted over the next several years the ultimate remediation cost and sequa’s share of that cost if any is uncertain

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in 2006 2005 and 2004 sequa recorded charges of 38 million 15 million and 25 million respectively to increase its accruals for remediation costs of the total 2004 charge 10 million was included in the results of discontinued operations and relates to the arc propulsion gainesville virginia facility at december 31 2006 the range of probable exposure for all remediation costs excluding financial liabilities assumed by aerojet is estimated to range from 113 million to 148 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 128 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from these estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 52 million in 2006 51 million in 2005 and 26 million in 2004 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 51 million and 70 million during 2007 and between 17 million and 20 million during 2008 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 10 million 12 million and 10 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 19 million in 2007 and 11 million in 2008 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were 89 million in 2006 93 million in 2005 and 92 million in 2004 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 94 million per year in 2007 and 2008

 item 1a risk factors 

general economic and market risk 

sequa’s operations may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and by changes in the economic conditions of the industries in which it operates many of the products offered experience cyclical demand and the results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclicality as discussed in this annual report on form 10k in item 7 in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading “riskconcentration of business” which is incorporated herein by reference the aerospace and automotive segments operate in industries that have experienced significant pressures in addition a significant portion of sequas operations is located outside the us which increases the risk related to changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and the general economic and market conditions to such countries 

competition 

sequa encounters substantial competition in each of its product areas in addition some of sequas competitors are larger and possess greater financial and other resources if sequa is unable to respond successfully to changing competitive conditions the demand for sequa’s products can be adversely affected 

indebtedness 

sequa has a significant amount of indebtedness the ability to service existing obligations with respect to interest and principal as well as the ability to refinance such principal will depend on the cash flow generated by sequas operations and the ability to receive future distributions on borrowings from sequas subsidiaries debt service requirements could result in a diversion of cash from the expansion or maintenance of operating infrastructure and sequa may incur additional costs to remedy any failure to comply with restrictions included in its debt agreements 

substantial control 

the estate of the late executive chairman of the board of directors controls more than 50 of the voting power of sequa stock and can effectively direct company policies elect all of the directors influence any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the company’s assets initiate a “going private” transaction and prevent or cause a “change in control” of sequa 

loss of key personnel 

sequa’s operations depend on a relatively small group of key management personnel the unexpected loss of the services of one or more individuals could have an adverse effect on operations of certain business units sequa’s future success will depend on its ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel

the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of sequa’s products particularly in the aerospace automotive metal coating and specialty chemicals segments sequa’s inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers longterm fixed price contracts with suppliers or productivity actions could adversely affect its results of operations

foreign operations 

international operations comprise a substantial proportion of sequa’s operating results and sequa’s strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets including developing markets such as china and india in 2006 33 of total sales were outside of the us risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations wage and price controls employment regulations foreign investment laws import and trade restrictions government instability and the ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions 

environmental liabilities 

sequa is subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards sequa has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and is a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters additional lawsuits claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future sequa is subject to various government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases sequa incurs and expects to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations in addition changes in laws regulations and enforcement of policies the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements or remedial techniques could require sequa to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on the financial condition or results of operations

tax liabilities 

sequa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions in 2006 sequa’s tax expense represented 258 of income from continuing operations before income taxes and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings that could effect the valuation of deferred tax assets future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and continuing assessments of sequa’s tax exposures

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

operating results 20062005 

sales 

overall sales increased 9 in 2006 led by strong advances in the aerospace and industrial machinery segments the automotive segment increased modestly and the metal coating specialty chemicals and other products segments decreased slightly the effect on sales of exchange rate movements was negligible for the year a detailed discussion of sales by operating segment follows

sales of the aerospace segment increased 17 in the current year the advance reflects the ongoing benefit of new product introductions and of sales added through longterm contracts with airline customers these contracts which give chromalloy the exclusive right to provide repairs replacement parts or inventory and engine management services on specific engines within the airline’s fleet have spurred sales and represent a source of ongoing revenue growth sales to the military and to marine and industrial turbine customers declined slightly in 2006 

sales of the automotive segment increased 1 in 2006 sales of arc automotive the airbag inflator unit increased 1 in 2006 due to improvement in domestic sales of passenger and sideimpact inflators offset by lower sales at the italian operation sales of casco products which manufactures cigarette lighters and electronic sensors increased 2 in 2006 higher sales of electronic products in europe and north america were partially offset by a decline in domestic lighter sales in 2006

sales of the metal coating segment decreased 3 in the current year lower steel sales from a metal management program in 2005 were partially offset by increased sales to the building products market in 2006 the improvement in sales to the building products market is expected to continue in 2007

sales of the specialty chemicals segment declined 2 in 2006 sales in 2006 were affected by modestly lower shipments of taed sales at the international marketing and distributions units advanced 7 in the current year sales growth through new product introductions and expansion of the distribution units is expected in 2007

sales of the industrial machinery segment advanced sharply posting a 20 improvement in 2006 the segment’s increase was primarily driven by higher sales of graphic arts equipment in the us and europe and increased sales of emission control equipment in europe sales for 2006 also reflect increased sales of industrial products equipment in asia

sales of the other products segment decreased 1 in 2006 sales for after six increased 3 reflecting a continued high level of demand from the formalwear market revenues from centor the real estate holding company declined 05 million or 34 in the current year due to a decrease in rental income resulting from the pending sale of its sole remaining property in new jersey in december 2006 centor sold two properties in virginia which contributed rental income of approximately 09 million in 2006 no rental income is expected to be earned in 2007

operating income 

overall operating income increased by 7 in 2006 as advances at the aerospace metal coating industrial machinery and other products segments were mitigated by a decline at the automotive segment and higher corporate expenses the results of the specialty chemicals segment in 2006 were on par with last year sequa’s foreign operations contributed operating income of 691 million in 2006 compared with 661 million in 2005 the increase in results from foreign operations is primarily driven by higher sales at the overseas operations of the aerospace segment partially offset by lower sales at arc automotive’s italian operation as well as startup costs to operate its new china facility a detailed review of operating income by segment follows

operating profits of the aerospace segment advanced 24 in 2006 primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and absorption of fixed costs results for the year were unfavorably affected by several factors a 39 million provision for customer claims related to repair services provided to certain commercial airline customers a 15 million reduction of sales to defer revenue in excess of the amount contractually recoverable at the balance sheet date and a 12 million loss on the sale of prepetition accounts receivable the effect of these factors were more than offset by 30 million of income resulting from the recognition of deferred revenue associated with a terminated contract with a commercial airline and the absence of two charges taken in 2005 56 million to reserve for receivables due from two airline customers that filed for bankruptcy protection and a 17 million pension curtailment charge caused by changes to sequa’s defined benefit plan

results of the automotive segment declined 38 reflecting a sharp decline at arc automotive partially offset by improved results at casco products the lower results at arc automotive are due to the following factors startup costs at new plants in mexico and china that amounted to 96 million lower sales in europe impact of higher steel surcharges and a charge of 20 million related to headcount reductions in the us barring any further deterioration in the automotive industry the benefits of transferring manufacturing operations to lowercost regions are expected to begin to accrue over the near term casco products posted an improvement as a result of higher sales and benefits derived from a series of actions to source from lowercost regions and improve overall operating efficiencies particularly through operational excellence programs

operating income in the metal coating segment advanced 3 in 2006 the impact of lower sales under metal management programs was more than offset by improved operating efficiencies price increases and an improved sales mix 

results of the specialty chemicals segment in 2006 were relatively unchanged from last year reflecting lower taed sales and higher energy costs in early 2006 a fire damaged a granulation plant at the segment’s warwick facility causing it to be shut down for three months the 140 million cost associated with the fire to repair the property and equipment and the premium cost to outsource the granulation process during the shutdown was covered by insurance the results in 2006 include 23 million of income from insurance proceeds to compensate for the business interruption caused by the fire

operating income of the industrial machinery segment advanced 31 in 2006 as a result of higher sales in all product categories at all major operations combined with ongoing productivity improvements stemming from six sigma and lowcost sourcing activities

operating income of the other products segment increased 04 million or 89 in 2006 results for the year reflect higher sales at the after six unit mitigated by 05 million of onetime charges related to contract cancellation fees and severance costs results of the centor unit declined primarily due to a decrease in rental income from its new jersey property

corporate expenses increased 6 in 2006 primarily due to a 31 million increase in environmental provisions associated with previously divested operations and 18 million of charges in relation to a voluntary separation program for corporate employees implemented in the fourth quarter of 2006 these factors were partially offset by the absence of a 18 million charge recorded in 2005 related to a separation agreement with a former senior executive officer as well as lower insurance costs and professional service fees

pension expense 

operating income includes net periodic pension cost exclusive of plan curtailments of 12 million in 2006 and 43 million in 2005 related to all significant funded defined benefit plans the decrease in net periodic pension cost is primarily reflected in the results of operations of the specialty chemicals segment of 19 million and the aerospace segment of 10 million on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect market conditions in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost the longterm expected rate of return in 2006 and 2005 was 83 the discount rate used in 2006 was 585 and 2005 was 600 net periodic pension cost exclusive of plan curtailments declined in 2006 from the 2005 level for the following reasons actual returns on plan assets in 2005 exceeded the expected returns which served to increase the asset base on which 2006 expected returns were calculated the increased returns and increased asset base decreased the level of amortizable actuarial losses and effective december 31 2005 sequa’s largest defined benefit plan was amended to limit actual and future participation

in the third quarter of 2005 sequas largest defined benefit plan was amended whereby effective december 31 2005 all active participants who had not reached the age of 45 were excluded from further participation in the plan such individuals instead received an increased contribution to the sequa 401k plan individuals 45 years of age or older had the onetime option of either continuing in the plan or electing to receive the additional contribution to the 401k plan the third quarter 2005 plan amendment resulted in a curtailment charge of 23 million aerospace 17 million metal coating 04 million and corporate 02 million in addition as a result of the merger of the atlantic research corporation employees pension plan into sequas largest defined benefit plan effective december 31 2005 sequa recorded a final curtailment charge of 02 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 

interest expense 

  interest expense in 2006 increased by 05 million compared with the prior year primarily as a result of interest expense incurred on the 100 million of foreign debt issued on december 21 2005 partially offset by the redemption through unsolicited offers of 1004 million of the 8875 senior notes maturing april 2008

interest income 

interest income increased 30 million in 2006 compared with the prior year the increase reflects a combination of higher average levels of cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates

equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 

sequa has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures which amounted to 865 million and 759 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively equity income from these joint ventures was 194 million in 2006 and 156 million in 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to increased sales at certain of the joint venture operations stemming from obtaining additional approvals to provide coating services or manufacture components for oem customers profits from the joint ventures are expected to continue to increase as the joint ventures work to increase their portfolio of new service and part offerings

chromalloy is a partner in joint ventures aimed at strengthening its ties to certain oems and airline customers as well as ensuring close cooperation with respect to the dissemination of technical specifications and requirements sequas investment in chromalloys joint ventures was 818 million and 744 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively equity income from chromalloys joint ventures was 196 million in 2006 and 158 million in 2005 the largest of the chromalloy joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs

chromalloy and siemens westinghouse power corporation and siemens aktiengesellschaft collectively referred to as siemens have joint ownership of four operating companies three of the companies provide service and repairs for heavy industrial gas turbines manufactured by other companies and for gas turbines based on the mature technologies of siemens and its affiliates these three operating companies are turbocare gas turbine services llc “tcgts” turbine services ltd “ts” and gas turbine technologies spa “gtt” the fourth operating company turbine airfoil coating and repair llc “tacr” provides coating and component services on siemen’s advanced engines chromalloy has a 49 ownership interest in tcgts which serves the north central and south american markets chromalloy has a 51 ownership interest in and operating control over ts which has operating assets in the uk and thailand and serves europe the far east and middle east the financial statements of ts are consolidated with those of sequa and a siemens minority interest is reflected mjb international limited “mjb” a partnership with al masaood is 49 owned by ts and provides repair and maintenance services for industrial gas turbines from a facility in the united arab emirates sequa has guaranteed a new bank line of credit as restructured in the second quarter of 2006 to replace the existing line of credit for mjb up to 68 million at december 31 2006 22 million was outstanding under this facility chromalloy has a 20 ownership interest in gtt which serves italy and certain other countries chromalloy has a 49 ownership interest in tacr

chromalloy has a 526 ownership interest in belac a component manufacturing operation that produces new replacement parts for jet engines the 526 ownership interest does not equate to a controlling interest primarily due to a super majority vote requirement at least 75 approval on certain key operational decisions while chromalloys partners in this joint venture are major commercial airlines whose industry has been under significant pressure management believes that the venture is adequately capitalized to carry on its principal operations without additional subordinated financial support at december 31 2006 sequas investment in belac totaled 102 million belac is not a variable interest entity as defined in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 “ consolidation of variable interest entities ” and therefore its financial statements are not consolidated with those of sequa

chromalloy has two 5050 joint ventures with rollsroyce plc turbine surface technologies ltd “tstl” which provides advanced coatings for rollsroyce turbine components and turbine repair technologies ltd “trtl” which provides advanced component repair services for certain rollsroyce engines sequa has guaranteed 50 of tstls future lease payments under the terms of a capital lease as well as 50 of an overdraft facility for its tstl joint venture total amounts subject to the guarantees may not exceed 93 million british pounds as adjusted for a new overdraft facility executed in june 2006 and a previously expired portion of the guarantee at december 31 2006 60 million british pounds were outstanding related to the guarantees

advanced coatings technologies “act” a 50owned joint venture with united technologies corporation owns and operates an electron beam ceramic coater for the application of pratt  whitney coatings to jet engine parts in january 2007 chromalloy and pratt  whitney announced plans to expand the act joint venture by opening a new facility which will double the capacity of the existing operation chromalloy expects to contribute approximately 17 million in machinery and equipment to the joint venture over the next 12 months 

premium on redemption of senior notes 

in 2006 other incomeexpense includes a charge of 43 million for premiums incurred on the redemption through unsolicited offers of 1004 million of the 8875 senior notes maturing april 2008 

other net 

in 2006 other net included 56 million of gain on the sale of property plant and equipment 34 million of gains related to insurance proceeds 34 million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs 23 million of income on the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance 19 million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees and 14 million of expense related to minority interest holders

in 2005 other net included 62 million of expense to record losses and to reduce the investment in a business transferred under contractual arrangements in 2004 26 million of expense related to minority interest holders 19 million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs 15 million of gain on the sale of property plant and equipment 13 million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees and 09 million gain on the fair market value of forward foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting

income from continuing operations before income taxes 

income from continuing operations before income taxes was 838 million for the year ended december 31 2006 which was composed of 657 million of profits earned by sequa’s foreign operations and 181 million of profits earned by sequa’s domestic operations for the year ended december 31 2005 sequa’s foreign operations contributed 700 million of income from continuing operations before income taxes and the domestic operations incurred 99 million of losses from continuing operations before income taxes the results of the domestic operations include approximately 659 million and 716 million of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively incurred primarily on the 9 and 8875 senior notes 

the improvement in the results of the domestic operations from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflects higher operating results at the aerospace metal coating and industrial machinery segments as well as a reduction in domestic interest expense due to the redemption of a portion of the 8875 senior notes during 2006 and a gain on the sale of domestic property the metal coating segment serves only the domestic market and the domestic operations of the aerospace and industrial machinery segments represent a majority of each segment’s sales at the aerospace segment both domestic and foreign operations have experienced an increase in operating income primarily as a result of sales added through longterm contracts with airline customers at the industrial machinery segment operating income of domestic operations increased more than that of foreign operations due to increased demand in the domestic graphic arts market

the decrease in results from foreign operations is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense due to 100 million of foreign debt incurred in december 2005 partially offset by increased operating results at sequa’s foreign operations

income tax provision benefit 

the effective tax rate for continuing operations was 258 in 2006 compared with 233 in 2005 in 2006 the 216 million income tax provision reflects higher domestic rates on taxable income compared with foreign tax rates 

in 2005 the 140 million income tax provision reflects lower foreign rates on taxable income when compared with domestic tax rates the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by certain foreign entities a 08 million reversal of tax reserves based on a current analysis of probable exposures and a 11 million reversal of tax reserves related to the satisfactory resolution of a state tax matter

in the fourth quarter of 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was passed which provided a special onetime 85 dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign dividends paid by december 31 2005 provided the criteria outlined in the tax law were met after evaluating the internal revenue service guidance as well the local laws and other agreements that govern dividends distributed by foreign subsidiaries sequa repatriated through a dividend approximately 1848 million of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 of the total amount 848 million represented available cash on hand at certain foreign operations and the remaining 1000 million represented funds available under a loan agreement with a major foreign bank leveraging certain foreign operations the loan agreement was effective december 21 2005 sequa recorded a tax provision of 91 million for the year ended december 31 2005 related to the above dividend which is separately identified in the consolidated statement of income

income loss from discontinued operations 

during 1991 sequa adopted a formal plan to divest the investment portfolio of its leasing subsidiary sequa capital corporation “sequa capital” and to classify it as a discontinued operation in 2006 the remaining investments in leveraged leases with an aggregate net book value of 427 million were sold for net cash proceeds of 470 million sequa recognized a net aftertax gain on the sales of 34 million or 031 per share pretax gain of 43 million

on september 14 2005 delta airlines and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 sequa capital held an investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with delta with a net amount of 139 million at september 14 2005 sequa capital determined that this investment was fully impaired as a result of the bankruptcy filing the aftertax charge to discontinued operations amounted to 97 million or 091 per share in 2005

riskconcentration of business 

sequas largest operation chromalloy 2006 sales of 10487 million or 480 of total consolidated 2006 sales operating income of 804 million or 624 of total consolidated 2006 operating income and total assets at december 31 2006 of 10843 million or 534 of total consolidated 2006 assets has confronted a difficult operating environment since the events of september 11 2001 while global airline traffic has rebounded high fuel costs high cost structures imbedded at the legacy carriers those carriers in existence prior to the deregulation of the airline industry and continuing terror threats have placed additional pressures on the airline industry leading several airlines to file for protection under chapter 11 chromalloy’s repair and oem operations derive approximately 80 of sales from the commercial aviation market the large repair and overhaul business is directly related to the number of hours jet engines are flown while the smaller oem business is related to the number of new jet engines placed in service in 2005 chromalloy’s results included a 56 million charge to reserve prepetition receivables related to certain delta and northwest airlines contracts both delta and northwest filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 on september 14 2005 at december 31 2006 trade and unbilled receivables due from commercial airlines totaled approximately 1399 million a discussion of various chromalloy customers that are operating or have operated under chapter 11 follows

the aggregate amount due to chromalloy from delta and northwest on the date of their chapter 11 filings was approximately 120 million in addition chromalloy currently leases 40 jet engines to northwest these leases were extended through december 31 2012 sequa in conjunction with outside legal counsel has reviewed the various contracts through which chromalloy conducts business with delta and northwest based on this review sequa believes that certain contracts will be considered executory in nature and that the underlying business objectives of the contracts will result in their assumption by the respective airlines therefore sequa expects that associated prepetition receivables will ultimately be collected sequa believes that certain other contracts may not be assumed and therefore recorded a 56 million charge to reserve related receivables in the third quarter of 2005 it is possible that the relative rights and obligations of chromalloy and the airlines may be changed during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings although such changes if any and their impact cannot presently be predicted chromalloy continues to discuss its business relationship with both delta and northwest in addition sequa believes that the engines leased to northwest are not impaired in 2006 sequa sold 110 million of prepetition accounts receivable and recognized a loss of 12 million on the sale delta accounted for 589 million or 56 of chromalloy’s sales in 2006 43 of sales in 2005 and 36 of sales in 2004 and northwest accounted for 446 million or 43 of chromalloy’s sales in 2006 27 of sales in 2005 and 13 of sales in 2004

  united airlines “ual” which emerged from chapter 11 in february 2006 accounted for 1389 million or 13 of chromalloy’s sales in 2006 13 of sales in 2005 and 18 of sales in 2004 in september 2003 chromalloy signed a 10year engine materialsbythehour contract with ual which began to contribute repair revenues in march 2004 at december 31 2006 trade and unbilled receivables with ual totaled 397 million 

independence air filed for protection under chapter 11 on november 7 2005 and suspended operations in early january 2006 in 2005 independence air accounted for less than 1 of chromalloy’s sales the prepetition net accounts receivable balance was nominal and the impact of the independence air filing on chromalloy’s operations was not significant 

in september 2004 us airways group inc “us airways” filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 chromalloy’s prepetition trade receivable balance with us airways was not material us airways emerged from chapter 11 and merged with america west airlines in 2006 us airways accounted for less than 1 of chromalloy’s sales 

chromalloy competes for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the oems which in certain cases have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements that allow it to repair certain components of engines the loss of a major oems approval to repair components for its engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to mitigate this effect

sequa is engaged in the automotive airbag inflator business through arc automotive arc automotives largest customers for airbag inflators are delphi automotive systems and its subsidiaries “delphi” and key safety systems inc and its subsidiaries “key safety” delphi accounted for 884 million or 35 of arc automotives sales in 2006 and 914 million or 36 of sales in 2005 key safety accounted for approximately 778 million or 31 of arc automotives sales in 2006 and 917 million or 37 of sales in 2005 these two customers accounted for approximately 45 of the automotive segments sales in 2006 on october 8 2005 delphi filed for protection under chapter 11 sequa’s relationship with delphi is governed by longterm supply and licensing agreements that govern arc automotive’s relationship with delphi in january 2006 these agreements were listed as executory in nature by delphi and sequa believes that the underlying business objectives of the agreements will result in their assumption sequa expects that the 09 million prepetition receivables will ultimately be collected

derivative and other financial instruments 

sequa is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and from changes in the prices of certain commodities which affect its earnings cash flows and financial condition sequa manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financial activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments sequa has established a control environment which assigns senior executives and in certain instances operational management responsibility for risk assessment and the approval reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities sequa does not buy hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes sequas primary foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound and to the euro to mitigate the short and nearterm effect of changes in currency exchange rates sequa utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and derivatives thereof to manage its exposure to certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge forecasted transactions and firm commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of its natural gas requirements to fixed rates depending on the use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an effective hedge gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of shareholders equity

a hypothetical 10 uniform decrease in all foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have decreased the fair value of sequas financial instruments by 05 million as of december 31 2006 and increased the fair value by 39 million as of december 31 2005 the sensitivity analysis relates only to sequas exchange ratesensitive financial instruments which include cash and debt amounts denominated in foreign currencies and all open foreign forward exchange contracts at december 31 2006 and 2005 the effect of this hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on the value of net assets other than financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and does not consider the effect this movement may have on anticipated foreign currency cash flows

at december 31 2006 and 2005 substantially all of sequas debt was at fixed rates with the exception of the 1000 million variable rate debt issued on december 21 2005 sequa currently does not hold interest rate derivative contracts accordingly a change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on sequas interest expense but would affect the fair value of sequas debt generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise the fair value of sequas total debt was 8072 million at december 31 2006 and 9701 million at december 31 2005 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 145 million at december 31 2006 and 219 million at december 31 2005 a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 149 million at december 31 2006 and 225 million at december 31 2005 the fair value of sequas total debt is based primarily upon quoted market prices of sequas unsecured securities the estimated changes in the fair values of sequas debt are based upon changes in the present value of future cash flows derived from the hypothetical changes in market interest rates

environmental matters 

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in 2006 2005 and 2004 sequa recorded charges of 38 million 15 million and 25 million respectively to increase its accruals for remediation costs of the total 2004 charge 10 million was included in the results of discontinued operations and relates to the arc propulsion gainesville virginia facility sequa has placed its insurance carriers on notice of a claim with respect to certain contamination and sequas present accruals do not consider possible recoveries from such carriers at december 31 2006 the range of probable exposure for all remediation costs excluding financial liabilities assumed by aerojet is estimated to range from 113 million to 148 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 128 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from these estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 52 million in 2006 51 million in 2005 and 26 million in 2004 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 51 million and 70 million during 2007 and between 17 million and 20 million during 2008 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 10 million 12 million and 10 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 19 million in 2007 and 11 million in 2008 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were 89 million in 2006 93 million in 2005 and 92 million in 2004 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 94 million per year during 2007 and 2008

backlog 

the business of sequa for which backlog is significant is megtec systems industrial machinery segment the dollar amount of backlog for this segment was 794 million or 47 of total consolidated backlog and 1008 million or 57 of total consolidated backlog as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively backlog in this segment was high at the end of 2005 due to certain significant orders from the printing industry in the fourth quarter of 2005 despite the decrease in backlog 2007 sales are expected to at least reach the 2006 level

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 640 million in 2006 compared with 558 million in 2005 the 82 million increase primarily reflects increased income from continuing operations after tax partially offset by higher working capital requirements cash used for investing activities was 349 million in 2006 compared with 764 million in 2005 the 415 million decrease primarily relates to 470 million of net cash proceeds received from the sale of leveraged leases included in discontinued operations partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures in the metal coating segment primarily related to a new plant in birmingham alabama cash used for financing activities was 1428 million in 2006 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 1162 million in 2005 the 2590 million decrease relates primarily to 1734 million of net debt payments compared with 1270 million of net proceeds from debt in 2005 partially offset by a 395 million increase due to the release of restricted cash requirements in 2006

on march 27 2006 sequa capital sold its ownership in two container ship leveraged leases for 308 million of net cash proceeds in the third quarter of 2006 sequa capital sold its ownership interest in the remaining leveraged leases for 162 million of net cash proceeds proceeds from the sales are being used for general corporate purposes

in december 2006 sequa sold two properties held by centor in gainesville virginia for net cash proceeds of 80 million and recognized a gain on the sale of 50 million as part of the sale sequa guaranteed 50 of the base rental income due from a third party lessee under an existing lease agreement which expires in october 2010 sequa deferred 18 million of additional gain the maximum exposure of the guarantee which will be recognized as the guarantee lapses

during 2006 sequa purchased through unsolicited offers 1004 million in aggregate of the 8875 senior notes maturing april 2008 at an average premium of 1044 management may elect to make additional purchases of outstanding senior notes based on availability and other considerations

on march 26 2006 standard  poor’s ratings services revised its outlook on sequa to stable from negative in september 2006 moody’s changed its rating practices for debt instruments which resulted in lowering sequa’s debt rating to b2 from b1 sequa’s unsecured debt ratings which are below investment grade are as follows moody’s b2 standard  poor’s rating services bb and fitch ratings bb

in the fourth quarter of 2005 sequa repatriated 1848 million in the form of a dividend from various foreign operating units under the guidelines of the american jobs creation act the “act” the act provided for a special onetime 85 dividendsreceived deduction on certain foreign dividends paid in 2005 provided the criteria outlined in the tax law were met under the act uses of the repatriated funds included the domestic expansion of production payment and training of domestic workers and the retirement of debt

of the 1848 million repatriated under the act 848 million represented available cash on hand at certain foreign operations and the remaining 1000 million was available through a december 21 2005 foreign loan agreement due to the complexities of foreign and domestic tax issues associated with the repatriation and the associated need to restructure certain lines of foreign ownership a 280 million shortterm loan existed at december 31 2005 between a thailand subsidiary of chromalloy and bangkok bank a 284 million restricted cash balance resided within thailand as collateral for principal and interest owed on the bangkok bank loan as of december 31 2005 the bangkok loan was repaid in full in the first quarter of 2006 the restricted cash balance is separately identified in the consolidated balance sheet

as indicated above on december 21 2005 certain foreign units in the specialty chemicals and aerospace segments each of which are indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of sequa and sequa as agent for such subsidiaries entered into a facility agreement the “facility agreement” with barclays bank plc “barclays” acting as agent and security agent for further syndication and arranged by barclays capital the facility agreement comprises a multicurrency variable rate 1000 million fiveyear term loan with quarterly principal repayments of 30 million a 350 million fiveyear term revolving credit facility available to the participating foreign subsidiaries and a 500 million fiveyear term letter of credit facility which replaces sequa’s existing letter of credit facility the facility agreement is secured by assets of the specialty chemicals segment as well as certain foreign operations of the aerospace segment the facility agreement is subject to financial covenants relating to the participating subsidiaries including as defined by the terms of the facility agreement ratios of net borrowings to ebitda ebitda to interest expense cash flow to senior debt service and cash flow to total debt service operating restrictions with specified allowed maximums as defined in the facility agreement include amounts to be expended on mergers and acquisitions investments in joint ventures intercompany loans capital lease obligations and guarantees investments in joint ventures by certain foreign subsidiaries are restricted in excess of 10 million british pounds in aggregate from the date of the facility agreement sequa believes that the joint ventures owned by these foreign units are adequately capitalized and any new investments if required could be funded through other sequa legal entities

sequas guarantees are primarily limited to the use of letters of credit and surety bonds that serve to guarantee sequas own performance with respect to liabilities owed or contractual deadlines a discussion of sequas letters of credit and surety bonds is included in the liquidity and capital resources section of this annual report on form 10k

src a special purpose corporation wholly owned by sequa has an rpa that extends through may 8 2009 a further discussion of the rpa is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the liquidity and capital resources section of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference

significant accounting policies and estimates 

  sequa believes that the application of the following accounting policies is important to its financial position and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of sequas significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and incorporated herein by reference

allowance for doubtful accounts 

certain of sequas operating segments provide services to industries that are experiencing or have experienced difficult economic pressures the aerospace segment performs repair and other services for the commercial airline industry and the arc automotive unit of the automotive segment has a major customer operating under chapter 11 see the riskconcentration of business section of the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion many of sequas customers are large wellknown companies and the customer base is monitored through a review of account balance agings an assessment of customer financial condition and interactions with the customers reserves are established through a combination of specific identification of problem accounts and percentages of aging brackets

inventory valuation 

the aerospace segment chromalloy maintains significant inventories of parts to serve the commercial aviation repair market in order to ensure that any obsolete or slow moving inventory is properly identified and valued chromalloy has in place a policy that mandates minimum writedown requirements based on usage the policy provides for a consistent and systematic approach to valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market with inventory values reassessed quarterly and at yearend for adequacy the decline in air travel immediately after september 11 2001 and the related reduction in the number of hours jet engines are flown had an unfavorable impact on inventory valuations a future precipitous decline in air travel would have a similar unfavorable impact management believes that the longterm outlook for the industry is positive

property plant and equipment 

sequa periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its property plant and equipment may not be recoverable if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable sequa estimates the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value sequa recognizes an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset

goodwill 

sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis sequa updated its review of goodwill on its selected annual test dates of october 1 2006 2005 and 2004 and noted no impairment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit if these estimates and assumptions change in the future due to such factors as a decline in general economic conditions a longterm or permanent decline in air travel competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control an impairment charge may be required details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k and are incorporated herein by reference

revenue recognition 

generally sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the selling price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and the services have been rendered or the products have been shipped and risk of loss has transferred to the customer 

the industrial machinery segment which consists solely of megtec systems manufactures and sells large industrial equipment for contracts that include multiple deliverables such as installation repair training aftermarket supplies or service sequa applies the guidance in emerging issues task force “eitf” 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” to determine whether the contract or arrangement contains more than one unit of accounting an arrangement is separated if 1 the delivered elements has value to the customer on a standalone basis 2 there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements and 3 the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered elements delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is considered probable and is substantially in the control of sequa if all three criteria are fulfilled the appropriate revenue recognition convention is then applied to each separate unit of accounting the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each component’s objectively determined fair value such as sales prices for the component when it is regularly sold on a standalone basis or thirdparty prices for similar components if the three criteria are not met revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period in which the last undelivered element is delivered the amount allocable to the delivered elements is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of additional elements or meeting other specified performance conditions

the aerospace segment which consists solely of chromalloy provides repair and overhaul services to commercial airline customers certain of which services are provided under long term materialsbythehour and powerbythehour contracts sequa applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts revenue is recognized as units are delivered based on the relative fair value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration or in the case when the services are similar based on an allocation of total contract revenue accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract consideration and applying the relative fair value to the services provided total contract consideration is estimated by applying a contractual billing rate per flight hour to the customer’s estimated total flight hours of a defined fleet over the term of a contract the services to be provided over the term of a contract are estimated from the frequency and extent of maintenance and overhaul requirements which are based on historical performance trends and regulatory guidelines significant factors that influence these estimates primarily include flight hour assumptions and fleet utilization 

as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 unbilled revenues recorded as an asset in relation to these contracts were 670 million and 393 million respectively the unbilled asset balance represents the cumulative difference between revenue recognized for delivered items and the amounts billed under the hourly billing arrangements in our contracts based on flight hours less any amounts of revenue that are deferred because they are not contractually recoverable the unbilled balance is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that the amounts are recoverable based on performance under the contract

previously sequa had applied the emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” to these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2006 sequa changed its accounting for these contracts to adopt a proportional performance model in accordance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” topic 13 sequa believes that this change is preferable as it better reflects its performance over the term of the contracts this change in accounting principle did not have an impact on the financial statements in any of the periods presented

pensions 

pension expense and pension liabilities are actuarially determined and are affected by managements assumptions with respect to the discount rate for obligations the future rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets pension expense and liabilities can also be affected by changes in plan benefits and the actual return on plan assets the discount rate is based on an analysis of discounted cash flows using an interest spot rate curve in conjunction with a further review of high and mediumgrade corporate longterm bond rates the rate of increase in compensation levels is based on managements assessment of the current and future economic environment and overall salary trends the expected longterm rate of return considers the allocation of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and economic and other indicators of future performance in addition sequa may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks a decrease of one percentage point in both the discount rate applied to projected benefit obligations and the assumed rate of return on plan assets of our significant defined benefit plans would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 50 million and 40 million respectively

in september 2006 statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans ” “sfas 158” was issued sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet changes in the funded status are to be recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur in addition sfas 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend balance sheet with limited exceptions an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required initially to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 “phase i” accordingly sequa adopted phase i of sfas 158 at december 31 2006 and recorded a 303 million net of tax charge to other comprehensive income in accordance with the provisions of sfas 158 sequa measures the funded status of its plans as of december 31 its fiscal yearend 

in 2006 the 42 million actuarial loss included in the calculation of the benefit obligation of sequa’s significant defined benefit plans was primarily driven by an increase in salary assumptions used in certain of the foreign plans in 2005 sequa used the rp2000 mortality table to calculate the benefit obligations for its defined benefit plans the change to the rp2000 mortality table in 2005 from the 83gam mortality table used in 2004 resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately 14 million in 2005 in addition sequa lowered the discount rate used to value its projected benefit obligation from 6 in 2004 to 585 in 2005 this change resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately 10 million in 2005 

income taxes 

sequa’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions sequa establishes reserves when despite its belief that the company’s tax return positions are fully supportable sequa believes that certain positions are subject to challenge and that it may not succeed sequa adjusts these reserves as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit

sequa has significant domestic net operating loss carryforwards management believes that such carryforwards will be utilized before their expiration through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future earnings and available tax planning strategies sequas ability to generate the expected amounts of domestic taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions the state of the airline industry and other major markets competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control there can be no assurance that sequa will meet its expectations for future domestic taxable income in the carryforward period or that available tax strategies can be enacted however management has considered the above factors in reaching the conclusion that it is more likely than not that future domestic taxable income and available tax strategies will be sufficient to fully realize the domestic operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets at december 31 2006

environmental 

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

other information 

in june 2006 fasb interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes ” “fin 48” was issued fin 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” fin 48 also prescribes a twostep evaluation process for tax positions the first step is recognition and the second is measurement for recognition an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if the tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 

tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date of fin 48 may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 accordingly sequa plans to adopt fin 48 on january 1 2007 as a result of the adoption of fin 48 sequa expects to recognize an increase of approximately 20 million to its reserve for certain tax benefits which will be recorded as a reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings

sales of the aerospace segment advanced 10 in 2005 a reflection of the recovery of the commercial airline aftermarket and of sales added through longterm contracts with airline customers sales to marine and industrial turbine customers rose 7 due to development and sales of high technology turbine components military sales declined slightly reflecting the absence of sales generated by a division that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004

sales of the automotive segment advanced 2 in 2005 with arc automotive ahead slightly and casco products up 5 at the domestic operation of arc automotive a 22 increase in unit volume primarily in passenger and side impact products led to higher sales and more than offset the effect of lower average selling prices arc’s european inflator operation posted a 34 decline in sales the result of a move early in the year by an overseas enduser to resource certain of its supply contracts sales of casco products advanced 5 due to higher sales of power outlets and electronic products in europe and increased sales of lighters in latin america domestic operations posted a sharp advance in lighter sales partially offset by a decline in sales of power outlets

the metal coating segment posted a 7 improvement over 2004 the result of increased sales under metal management programs and higher sales to the container products market these factors were partially offset by a decline in sales to the building products market due to the fallout from the volatility in the domestic steel industry during 2004

sales of the specialty chemicals segment declined 2 in 2005 due to a slight decline in volumes of the detergent additive taed and in sales of the specialty chemicals distribution units these factors were partially offset by sales added from the acquisition in late 2004 of a small manufacturer of test products used by the detergent and chemicals industries excluding the impact of this acquisition local currency sales were down 3 in 2005 

the industrial machinery segment posted a 17 sales increase in 2005 reflecting higher sales of emission control equipment primarily in the us market and improvement in the graphic arts market in europe

sales of the other products segment declined 20 in 2005 as a decline in sales at the after six unit was partially offset by higher revenues from centor sequas real estate holding company

operating income 

overall operating income advanced 52 led by strong advances at the aerospace metal coating and industrial machinery segments as well as improvements at the automotive and specialty chemicals segments the increase in operating income also reflected a 58 million decline in pension costs after inclusion of a 25 million pension curtailment loss incurred as a result of changes to sequa’s defined benefit plan these factors were mitigated by a charge of 56 million at the aerospace segment to reserve for receivables due from two airline customers that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter sequas foreign operations contributed 660 million of operating income in 2005 compared with 614 million in 2004 a detailed review of operating results by segment follows

in the aerospace segment operating profit advanced 51 in 2005 due to the following factors a higher level of sales and improved absorption particularly in the engine component repair operations the absence of 82 million of upfront contract costs recognized in 2004 and the disposition of two operating units that generated losses in 2004 the 2005 results were mitigated by a charge of 56 million to reserve for receivables due from two airline customers that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter 

operating profit of the automotive segment increased 14 in 2005 with advances at the casco products unit partially offset by a slight decline at arc automotive arc automotive’s results in 2005 were affected by the following factors costs related to the startup of new plants in china and mexico increased raw material costs stemming from steel surcharges and lower sales at its italian operation these factors were partially offset by higher domestic sales the absence of a 41 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2004 at its italian operation and lower selling general and administrative costs casco products posted improved results in 2005 due to the following higher sales the benefits of continuing six sigma initiatives previous restructuring actions and lower pension expense

operating income advanced 19 in the metal coating segment the impact of higher natural gas costs and increased raw material costs was more than offset by improved operating efficiencies price increases an improved sales mix and the settlement of a legal claim which resulted in a reversal of charges of 14 million recorded in 2004

the specialty chemicals segment posted a 6 increase in operating income in 2005 due to the inclusion of profits from a small manufacturer of test products used by the detergent and chemicals industries acquired in late 2004 and to operating efficiencies achieved through ongoing operational excellence programs and lower pension costs

operating profit of the industrial machinery segment more than tripled in 2005 as a result of the following factors the higher level of sales productivity improvements generated through six sigma programs and lower pension and insurance costs

results of the other products segment decreased sharply in 2005 due primarily to lower sales at the after six men’s formalwear unit 

corporate expenses decreased 7 in 2005 due to declines in pension expense professional fees related to sarbanesoxley compliance and insurance costs the benefit of these factors was partially offset by a 18 million charge related to a separation agreement with a former senior executive officer 

pension expense 

operating income included net periodic pension cost exclusive of plan curtailments of 43 million in 2005 and 125 million in 2004 related to all significant funded defined benefit plans on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect market conditions in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost the longterm expected rate of return in 2005 and 2004 was 83 the discount rate used in 2005 and 2004 was 60 net periodic pension cost exclusive of plan curtailments declined in 2005 from the 2004 level for the following reasons actual returns on plan assets in 2004 exceeded the expected returns which served to increase the asset base on which 2005 expected returns were calculated the increased returns and increased asset base decreased the level of amortizable actuarial losses and effective january 1 2005 plan benefits were frozen for casco products and megtec systems employees participating in sequas largest defined benefit plan

the plan amendment effective january 1 2005 resulted in a curtailment charge recorded in december 2004 of 08 million automotive 04 million and industrial machinery 04 million

interest expense 

  interest expense in 2005 was on par with the prior year

interest income 

interest income increased 10 million in 2005 compared with the prior year the increase reflected a combination of higher average levels of cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition restructuring and asset impairment charges inventory valuation investment impairments stockbased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of longlived assets and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period 

or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome requiring future adjustments to revenue 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises asset impairments primarily consist of property plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 staff accounting bulletin 100 restructuring and impairment charges sab 100 emerging issues task force 943 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 943 and lastly sfas no 146 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 which was effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

investment impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our costmethod investments below their cost basis are judged to be otherthantemporary significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is otherthantemporary including the severity and duration of the impairment forecasted recovery the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

stockbased compensation in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased 

payment sfas no 123r sfas no 123r addresses all forms of sharebased payment sbp awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights sfas no 123r supersedes our current accounting for sbp awards under apb no 25 and requires us to recognize compensation expense for all sbp awards based on fair value in march 2005 the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 107 sharebased payment sab no 107 relating to the adoption of sfas no 123r beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r under the modified prospective transition method using the blackscholes option pricing model under the new standard our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility employee exercise patterns expected life of the options future forfeitures and related tax effects we will recognize sbp compensation expense for awards issued after november 1 2005 on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the award for awards issued prior to november 1 2005 we will recognize sbp compensation expense based on fasb interpretation 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 15 and 25 which provides for accelerated expensing we are continuing to evaluate the impact of sfas no 123r on our results of operations and financial condition 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover and retiree mortality rates we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date — october 31 for us plans and september 30 for nonus plans the discount rate for us plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds the discount rate for nonus plans was generally determined in a similar manner differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates in recent years decreasing interest rates particularly outside the us have increased our benefit obligations and our net plan costs these increases have been in large part offset by a declining number of plan participants as a result of our various restructuring programs the entire impact of declining discount rates is not recognized immediately under current accounting standards as of october 31 2005 delayed recognition of the impact of declining discount rates was the primary factor in approximately 390 million in unrecognized actuarial losses for nonus plans these losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants — ranging from 12 to 18 years depending on the plan 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns our estimate of expected longterm rates of return has declined in recent years declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense this trend has been offset by the impact of company contributions to the plans and growth in plan assets resulting in increased expected returns on plan assets in 2003 through 2005 as of october 31 2005 delayed recognition of better than expected investment experience was a significant factor in 30 million of unrecognized actuarial gains for us plans these gains will be 

recognized over approximately 12 years or the expected average future service life for us plan participants a one percent change in the estimated longterm return on plan assets for 2006 would result in a 6 million impact on us pension expense and a 13 million impact on nonus pension expense 

we expect reduced pension and postretirement expense in 2006 due to the sale of our semiconductor products business and further restructuring these events individually or in the aggregate may trigger plan curtailments or settlements under sfas no 88 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  we can not currently estimate this impact 

valuation of longlived assets we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired we have also assessed the recoverability of our longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows we incurred 26 million of investment and restructuring asset impairment charges in 2005 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions we then determine the carrying value of these businesses we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we performed the required transitional impairment test upon our adoption of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded a 268 million charge related to goodwill 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets such as our property plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the third quarter of 2003 we recorded a noncash charge to establish a valuation allowance of 14 billion which included approximately 04 billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of 2003 this left an 

approximately 10 billion net tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for 2003 the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis cumulative losses incurred in the us and selected entities in other foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 109 accordingly a full valuation allowance was recorded in certain entities of those selected jurisdictions we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance profits or losses incurred in the us and selected entities in other jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance we expect that pretax income in fiscal 2006 will be recognized at a lower rate because future income taxes in the us and entities in other jurisdictions will be offset against adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions 

we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the cumulative amount of which is approximately 355 million as of october 31 2005 because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

restructuring and asset impairment 

restructuring plans initiated in 2001 2002 and 2003 prior plans are substantially complete in 2005 we initiated a new restructuring plan fy05 plan with the fy05 plan we intend to reduce infrastructurerelated employment by about 1300 jobs and reduce our annual infrastructure costs by more than 450 million with approximately 250 million savings from job elimination and transfer to lower cost regions approximately 100 million savings from consolidations of facilities and 100 million reduced information technology it spending of the 1300 infrastructurerelated jobs approximately 600 employees have been notified as of october 31 2005 and we expect another 700 employees will be notified in the fiscal year 2006 the fy05 plan also extends to job reductions within our business segments of approximately 900 people all of whom were notified as of october 31 2005 these reductions will be concentrated in the semiconductor test solutions and electronic measurement businesses with semiconductor test solutions reductions focused in the us germany and japan and electronic measurement reductions focused in the us and the uk as of october 31 2005 we have reduced our workforce by approximately 16900 people approximately 16300 people from prior plans and approximately 600 people from the fy05 plan to approximately 21000 employees excluding our former semiconductor products business employees 

we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of 123 million 161 million and 372 million for the fiscal years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our accrual for future restructuring expenses totaled 93 million as of october 31 2005 and it encompasses the fy05 plan and our remaining liability for consolidation of excess facilities from prior plans our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges of 10 million in 2005 for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sublease agreements related to prior plans similar charges in 2004 and 2003 were 35 million and 37 million respectively we will continue to make lease payments on some of this excess facility space over the next five years 

the restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for further details on our restructuring plans see note 14 restructuring and asset impairment to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet as our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities however movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net income loss in the periods presented 

indemnifications 

indemnifications to hewlettpackard 

we have given multiple indemnities to hewlettpackard hp in connection with our activities prior to our spinoff from hp for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spinoff these indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business including but not limited to employee tax intellectual property and environmental matters the agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on form s1 filed on august 16 1999 in our opinion the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 

indemnifications to officers and directors 

our corporate bylaws require that we indemnify our officers and directors as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request against expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to agilent in addition we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each boardappointed officer of agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances the indemnification obligations are more fully described in the bylaws and the indemnification agreements we purchase insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our bylaws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated historically we have not made payments related to these obligations and the fair value for these obligations is zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 31 2005 

indemnifications to avago 

in connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in december 2005 we agreed to indemnify avago its affiliates and other related parties for certain liabilities that were excluded from the sale such as preclosing taxes and other specified items 

other indemnifications 

as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the us and other jurisdictions many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts such as defense settlement or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products from time to time we indemnify customers as well as our suppliers contractors lessors lessees companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom 

we enter into contracts against combinations of loss expense or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services the use of their goods and services the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts usually up to a specified maximum amount in addition from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities additional product liability or environmental obligations in our experience claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material 

results from continuing operations 

for the fiscal year ended 2005 income from continuing operations was 141 million an increase of 14 million from 127 million in 2004 and almost a 2 billon improvement from the 1777 million loss incurred in 2003 the increase of 14 million in 2005 was primarily due to tighter cost controls the increase in income from 2003 to 2004 of approximately 1904 million was primarily due to approximately a 1 billion tax charge in 2003 relating to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the us and the uk also contributing to 2004s improved performance over 2003 was growth in revenue of 692 million improvement in gross margin of 6 percentage points and a decline in operating expenses of 263 million yearoveryear agilent saw a 1 percentage point improvement in its operating margin in 2005 compared to 2004 despite a revenue decrease of 21 million this was due to controls over our operating expenses the continued move of manufacturing capacity to lower cost regions and restructuring savings 

orders and net revenue 

  orders in 2005 were up by 5 percent yearoveryear with nearly all our businesses achieving order growth we experienced good growth in wireline communications test and solid demand in our bioanalytical business orders in 2004 were up by 13 percent compared to 2003 with all businesses growing except semiconductor test solutions which saw a 19 percent decrease over the prior year primarily caused by our customers excess capacity and excess inventory that had built up over the second half 

net revenue in 2005 was flat compared to 2004 growth in the bioanalytical and electronic measurement businesses was offset by a cyclical softness that affected our semiconductor test solutions business in the first half of 2005 net revenue in 2004 increased by 15 percent over 2003 all of our businesses experienced an increase in revenue in 2004 

services and other includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products warranty extensions and consulting in 2005 and 2004 services and other revenue increased over the prior year as our installed base of products increased and a change in standard warranty from three years to one year drove a higher volume of extended warranty business 

costs and expenses 

 the following tables present the gross inventory charges and sales of previously reserved inventory respectively 

gross inventory charges 



sales of previously reserved inventory 



1 unallocated charges primarily relate to inventory writedowns for exited product lines which management has not reflected in segment results 46 

total gross margin increased 2 percentage points from 2004 to 2005 this improvement was the result of restructuring activities material cost reductions and overall operational improvements including mix improvements total gross margin increased 6 percentage points from 2003 to 2004 

gross margin on both product and service increased 2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004 this is a reflection of our continued work on lowering our cost structure we expect to continue to experience the benefits of a more variable cost structure through use of contract manufacturers in addition we will continue to reduce our own manufacturing costs by shifting production to lowercost regions in 2004 gross margin on services and other increased 2 percentage points and gross margin on products increased 7 percentage points over 2003 as a reflection of lower cost structure principally through our restructuring programs 

operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2005 compared to 2004 slightly lagging the improvement achieved in gross margin due to increased research and development expense in 2004 operating margin increased 19 percentage points compared to 2003 this was primarily due to savings from our restructuring efforts and a 128 million decrease in restructuring costs for research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies in communications electronics and bioanalytical measurement none of which is individually significant to our operations this research and development is aimed at improving the more than 20000 products already in production and on new product releases because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses and at agilent laboratories it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects we are committed to bringing new products to the market and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 

income from operations in 2005 was 181 million an increase of approximately 36 million compared to 2004 the increase was primarily driven by a 60 million decrease in costs and expenses due to the incremental benefits of our restructuring programs and discretionary spending controls income from operations in 2004 was 145 million an increase of approximately 865 million from 2003 the increase was primarily due to a revenue increase of 692 million combined with a 159 million reduction in restructuring charges in 2004 compared to 2003 

at october 31 2005 our headcount on a continuing operations basis was approximately 20750 compared to 21200 in 2004 and 22000 in 2003 

other income expense net 

 as discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in 2005 we reclassified our equity earnings and gain in 2005 from our lumileds 

joint venture from other incomeexpense net to a new caption below the provision for income taxes see note 22 equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate including gain — lumileds to our consolidated financial statements prior periods amounts have also been reclassified 

other income expense net generally includes interest income interest expense rental income currency gain loss on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items other income expense net increased by 49 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to an increase in interest income of 45 million derived principally from the investment of our increased surplus cash balances in bank time deposits and other money market instruments and higher interest rates other income expense net remained flat from 2003 to 2004 

provision for income taxes from continuing operations 



we have restated our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004 quarterly financial data for the fourth quarter ended october 31 2004 and selected financial data for fiscal 2004 the restatement the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and selected financial data was made by our management in consultation with the audit  finance committee on january 13 2006 as a result of our identification of an error related to the accounting for income taxes during the october 31 2004 yearend close process the company miscalculated and understated its estimate of us jurisdictional loss by correcting the error and revising the estimate of us loss this resulted in the recognition of additional tax benefit associated with the loss and a corresponding additional income tax expense associated with accumulated other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 109 this error was identified through the operation of our internal control over financial reporting in 2005 the restatement decreases our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 by 20 million and increases net income by 20 million or 004 per diluted share 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca was signed into law the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and will report an extraordinary dividend as defined in the ajca of 970 million and a related tax liability of approximately 48 million in our fiscal 2005 federal income tax return for fiscal 2005 23 million of the 48 million is provided for in the discontinued operations provision for income taxes while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations provision for income taxes 

for the year ended october 31 2005 we recorded an income tax provision of 155 million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of 71 million and 1090 million on continuing operations for the years ended october 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the current yeartodate provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the us and other jurisdictions for which we have a valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2003 we recorded a noncash charge to establish a valuation allowance of 14 billion which included approximately 04 billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of 2003 resulting in an approximate 10 billion net deferred tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for 2003 the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis cumulative losses incurred in the us and entities in other jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 109 to require a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 

for 2005 the annual effective tax rate was 523 percent on continuing operations the 523 percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes in jurisdictions other than the us and entities in other jurisdictions in which income tax or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance the tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from lowtax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business which is now reported within discontinued operations additionally the ajca repatriation tax caused an 81 percent increase in the 2005 effective tax rate as during 2005 we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided for us taxes from time to time the company undertakes certain employment capital and other investment actions that subject the companys income to reduced tax rates the annual effective tax rate may change over time as the amount or mix of income and taxes changes our effective tax rate is calculated using our projected annual pretax income or loss and is affected by research and development tax credits the expected level of other tax benefits the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions the impact of changes to the valuation allowance changes in other comprehensive income as well as changes in the mix of income and losses outside the us and entities in other jurisdictions having varying statutory rates 

for 2004 the annual effective tax rate was 359 percent on continuing operations and was benefited by a valuation allowance release of 37 million for 2003 the annual effective tax rate was 1586 percent on continuing operations due primarily to the charge for the valuation allowance 

equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate including gain — lumileds 

lumileds is a global joint venture between agilent and philips lumileds manufactures highpower light emitting diodes and solidstate lighting solutions agilents ownership interest in lumileds was approximately 47 percent as of october 31 2005 our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate for the three years ended october 31 2005 was 34 million 29 million and 9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 we sold 1 percent of our interest in lumileds to philips for a gain of 8 million agilent sold its interest in lumileds on november 28 2005 see note 24 subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements 

general infrastructure and shared services 

for agilent overall we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily through restructuring programs and cost controls we have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance it and workplace services and moved some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions compared to 2004 incremental savings for infrastructure costs for 2005 associated with restructuring plans it data center and networking costs 

it project investments and cost controls were approximately 20 million we passed through these savings to all our businesses according to usage of related services the general infrastructure and shared services functions ended 2005 with approximately 3910 employees a decrease of approximately 140 employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately 370 employees from two years ago over the past two years general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped approximately 570 in the us and europe but has grown approximately 210 in asia primarily in india we expect to continue to reduce infrastructure costs currently reported in continuing operations as we divest our semiconductor products business and spinoff our semiconductor test solutions business approximately 200 general infrastructure and shared services employees will be moving to our divested semiconductor products business in 2006 

segment overview 

agilent is the worlds premier measurement company providing core bioanalytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications electronics life sciences and chemical analysis industries we have three primary businesses electronic measurement bioanalytical measurement and semiconductor test solutions in addition to the discussion below also see note 23 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

electronic measurement 

our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design development manufacture installation deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services 

orders and net revenue 

 compared to 2004 electronic measurement experienced a 3 percent increase in orders while our wireless communications test orders grew only slightly from last year we experienced significant growth in our wireline communications test general purpose test orders remained flat yearoveryear the 21 percent increase in orders in 2004 compared to 2003 was related to strong aerospace defense business growth in the communications test market for consumer electronics dvd players lcd tvs cell phones and expansion of the asian handset manufacturing capacity 

electronic measurement revenues were up 1 percent yearoveryear in 2005 communications test makes up approximately 60 percent of the electronic measurement revenues and wireless test makes up approximately 85 percent of communications test the communication test revenues were up 2 percent yearoveryear with a 1 percent yearoveryear increase in wireline test and a 2 percent yearoveryear increase in wireless test this was mainly due to the strength of our signal analyzers and signal generatorrelated products telecom service provider network integration and nextgeneration ip services general purpose test revenues were flat yearoveryear in 2004 segment revenues increased 17 percent compared to 2003 largely due to the expansion of cell phone handset production in asia 

looking forward to 2006 we anticipate moderate revenue growth to be driven by opportunities tied to the universal adoption of 3g broadband access proliferation and our recent oscilloscope market share gains 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the electronic measurement businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004 and 2004 versus 2003 

 over the past three years we have implemented cost reduction and restructuring plans to help lower our cost structure our electronic measurement business ended 2005 with approximately 11460 employees a decrease of approximately 430 employees from one year ago and 1200 employees from two years ago 

gross margin for products and services increased 2 percentage points yearoveryear in 2005 this improvement was driven by restructuring activities material cost reductions and overall operational improvements and was achieved despite a 27 million increase in inventory charges in 2005 gross margin for products and services increased 8 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003 

operating margin increased 2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004 with research and development expenses increasing slightly and selling general and administrative expenses decreasing slightly due to savings from restructuring activities and discretionary spending controls in 2004 operating margin increased 21 percentage points compared to 2003 with operational expenses decreasing by 159 million as a result of restructuring savings and expense reduction 

income from operations 

income from operations increased in 2005 by 81 million compared to 2004 on a revenue increase of 40 million restructuring through workforce reductions reduction in our cost structure and discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results the 615 million improvement in income from operations in 2004 compared to 2003 was achieved through strong revenue growth in combination with an 8 percentage point improvement in gross margins and a 159 million reduction in research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

bioanalytical measurement 

our bioanalytical measurement business provides applicationfocused solutions that include instruments software consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products our seven key product categories include microarrays microfluidics gas chromatography liquid chromatography mass spectrometry software and informatics and related consumables reagents and services the business achieved solid growth in 2005 with orders and revenue growing by 12 percent and 7 percent respectively compared to 2004 and operating income up 6 percent all seven key product categories contributed to the overall growth of the bioanalytical measurement segment 

orders and net revenue 

 bioanalytical measurement business orders and revenue continued to grow achieving record levels in 2005 growth was achieved in all geographies with the highest rates achieved in asia and europe in both 2004 and 2005 growth over the prior year was driven by demand for replacement instrument systems and consumables in our large installed base in the us and europe increased us government spending for homeland security spending related to environmental testing in asia and increased demand from generic drug manufacturers 

looking forward to 2006 we anticipate order and revenue to grow from 2005 levels with strength across both our life science and chemical analysis businesses we anticipate growth to be driven by new products such as rapid resolution liquid chromatography single quadrupole ms for lc detection lcms triple quadrupole qqq and lcms quadrupole timeofflight qtof

the following table shows the bioanalytical measurement businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004 and 2004 versus 2003 

 gross margin from products and services increased 2 percentage points compared to same period last year as a result of revenue growth improved microarray production processes and increased efficiencies in support delivery looking forward we expect to continue this trend in 2006 

operating margin remained flat compared to the same period last year as we invested heavily in research and development and had small headcount increases within selling general and administrative to accommodate growth 

income from operations 

income from operations increased 6 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due to increased revenue operating margin remained flat in 2005 compared to 2004 at 14 percent excluding the impact of acquisitions in 2005 operating margin increased 1 percentage point compared to 2004 

semiconductor test solutions 

our semiconductor test solutions business provides test solutions that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices these solutions are complemented by consulting service and support offerings such as startup assistance application services and system calibration and repair our semiconductor test solutions enable designers and manufacturers to shorten the designtoproduction cycle lower manufacturing cost of test confirm the functional quality of their devices and of their manufacturing processes and accelerate the highvolume delivery of their products as previously announced we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business during 2006 

orders and net revenue 

 we believe that the semiconductor test market has passed the bottom of a downturn that began in the third quarter of 2004 and continued into the first half of 2005 throughout the second half of 2005 the semiconductor test market exhibited a recovery driven by increased demand for flash memory used in cellular phones cameras portable music players and other electronic devices in addition to strong demand for nonmemory chips in endmarkets such as wireless handsets other consumer electronics and personal computers this helped orders increase by 3 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 in 2004 orders decreased 19 percent compared to 2003 primarily due to a weak second half caused by excess customer inventory and delayed customer purchases in anticipation of our next generation flash memory and soc test systems 

in second half of 2005 we have seen increased sales of our new pin scale systems introduced in late 2004 as our next generation soc test system this system allows customers to reduce their infrastructure costs and offers new test capabilities at higher testing speeds the acceptance attests to the benefits of our single platform strategy and to the ease of migration for customers this includes an expanding presence in very cost sensitive digital consumer applications including many systems for mp3 digital tv and dvd parts because of the flexibility and scalability of the pin scale platform we are now addressing entirely new markets from costsensitive digital consumer applications to high speed memory test pin scale products comprised approximately 40 percent of the business in 2005 and are expected to rise in 2006 if demand in end markets continues to be strong in the upcoming year 

memory test systems which represents approximately 27 percent of our semiconductor test business were driven throughout 2005 by strength in consumer products such as cell phones cameras and mp3 players large independent device manufacturers idms drove the majority of the business for memory testing equipment as a result of the overall increase in not and nand flash memory demand with the remainder coming from smaller independent test houses 

total net revenue in 2005 decreased 25 percent compared to 2004 primarily due to severe weakness across our product portfolio in the first half of 2005 total net revenue in 2004 increased 12 percent compared to 2003 due to soc test market strength but this was partially offset by weakness 

in flash memory test services and other revenue decreased 7 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 19 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 it includes the sale of support for hardware and software servicing our installed base and the sale of services such as training application development and test consulting for new installations services and other revenue tends to show lower volatility than hardware revenue since services are provided over one year or more looking forward to fiscal year 2006 we are optimistic about revenue growth 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the semiconductor test businesss margins expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004 and 2004 versus 2003 

 gross margin for products and services decreased 11 percentage points in 2005 from 2004 due to competitive pricing pressure and a 22 million inventory charge on the v4400 system and other legacy product lines partially offset by sales of previously reserved inventory gross margin for products and services decreased 2 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003 because of a competitive pricing environment on an absolute dollar basis the cost of products and services decreased 11 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due to reduced volume and increased 17 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a higher volume of sales our semiconductor test business continues to implement cost control programs as well as outsource production to contract manufacturers transferring manufacturing to lowcost regions and closely monitoring indirect and direct material costs 

the operating margin decreased 22 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004 this was mainly due to the decrease in gross margins referenced above and an increase in research and development as a percentage of revenue in preparation for the complete rollover of the ste product line in addition to higher field selling costs to help customers migrate to new products in 2004 the operating margin increased 3 percentage points compared to 2003 with a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher research and development spending 

on an absolute dollar basis selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased 6 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003 the decreases reflect the implementation of initiatives to control discretionary spending 

loss income from operations 

throughout 2004 we saw improvements in revenue and income from operations followed by a market downturn into the first half of 2005 with a recovery in the second half of 2005 our semiconductor test business exits the current year with strong orders and a competitive line of products in addition utilization rates for our 93k systems finished the year at above average industry rates 

discontinued operations 

in august 2005 the board of directors of agilent approved the divestiture of our semiconductor products business we subsequently signed an asset purchase agreement with avago providing for the 

sale of our semiconductor products business for approximately 266 billion we have reflected the semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k on december 1 2005 we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to avago for further information see note 24 subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements in 2005 our costs directly associated with this transaction were approximately 32 million and are included in the discontinued operation results below 

discontinued operations results for the past three years are summarized in the table below and include the results of the camera module business which was sold in february 2005 as discussed in the restatement — explanatory note we have restated our 2004 results of operations to correct for an error in the provision for income taxes this restatement also affected our net results of discontinued operations and is discussed in note 1a restatement of 2004 consolidated financial statements to our consolidated financial statements 



financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position remained strong at october 31 2005 with cash and cash equivalents of 2226 million as compared to 2315 million at october 31 2004 

net cash provided by operating activities 

we generated cash from continuing operations of 643 million in 2005 compared to 432 million in 2004 we spent 110 million on restructuring activities in 2005 primarily in the form of severance payments compared to 138 million in 2004 

in 2005 accounts receivable generated cash of 29 million versus cash generated of 117 million in 2004 days sales outstanding as of october 31 2005 was 53 days as compared to 56 days as of october 31 2004 while revenue remained flat the decline in days sales outstanding reflects the continuing improvement in receivables management in 2005 accounts payable generated cash of 21 million versus cash generated of 47 million in 2004 inventory generated cash of 2 million in 2005 compared to 10 million used in 2004 inventory days on hand also improved as of the end of 2005 at 101 days compared to 109 days as of the end of 2004 

in 2005 we contributed 41 million to fund our us defined benefit plan compared to 63 million in 2004 in 2005 we contributed 36 million to fund our international defined benefits plans compared to 83 million in 2004 in 2005 total pension plan contributions were 77 million or 

47 percent less than in 2004 in 2006 we expect funding requirements for our various benefit plans to decrease slightly to a total of approximately 75 million our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities among other factors as the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status in 2005 we recorded an additional minimum pension liability for 170 million as several of our nonus defined benefit retirement plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets the establishment of the additional minimum liability also resulted in a net long term deferred tax asset for 55 million of which 34 million was offset by a valuation allowance 

in 2005 as in 2004 we recorded no goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 142 depreciation and amortization decreased from 218 million in 2004 to 186 million in 2005 reflecting the reduced acquisitions of property plant and equipment over the past few years and the full amortization of other intangibles relating to business combinations completed in earlier years such as the objective systems integration acquisition in 2001 we paid income taxes amounting to 75 million in 2005 as compared to 149 million in 2004 

net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations which is not included above was 256 million in 2005 as compared to 238 million in 2004 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for 2005 was 173 million compared to 82 million in 2004 investments in property plant and equipment increased by 55 million to 139 million in 2005 compared to 2004 we also used 64 million for acquisitions of related businesses as compared to 18 million in 2004 cash provided by divestitures was 8 million in 2005 

net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was 27 million in 2005 as compared to cash used of 32 million in 2004 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in 2005 was 780 million compared to cash generation of 138 million in 2004 we completed the optional redemption of all the 3 percent senior convertible debentures due 2021 in the fourth quarter of 2005 the aggregate outstanding principal amount was approximately 115 billion in lieu of cash redemption holders of approximately 466 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 145 million shares of agilent common stock the remaining 684 million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash and as a result agilent no longer has any of the debentures outstanding loss on redemption of convertible debt amounted to 7 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 4466 billion of our common stock under the program during the fourth quarter of 2005 we repurchased 89 million shares for 290 million repurchased shares and related costs have been accounted for as treasury shares using the cost method also subsequent to our fiscal year end we initiated a selftender offer for an additional 73 million of our shares under the repurchase program with the right to repurchase up to an additional 2 percent of our outstanding shares as of october 31 2005 subsequent to year end in december 2005 the tender offer expired and we agreed to accept for payment 83 million shares at a purchase price of 36 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately 3 billion to date we have repurchased approximately 92 million shares for 33 billion which leaves approximately 12 billion remaining authorized under our stock repurchase program the remaining repurchases may be affected in a number of ways including open market purchases 

block trades additional selftender offers accelerated share repurchase transactions and other means the program is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2007 

we funded the 33 billion in total repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program with cash on hand and from the proceeds of the sale of our semiconductor products business and our lumileds joint venture we also drew down 700 million on a 1 billion senior secured term borrowing facility we entered into the facility in december 2005 and it matures no later than april 2006 the term facility allows us to borrow at an interest rate equal to onemonth libor plus 30 basis points per annum or for shorter libor periods if we and the lenders so agree prior to its final maturity we expect to replace the term facility with permanent financing as a condition of the term facility we will segregate investments equal to 10525 percent of the principal borrowed as restricted assets on our balance sheet we plan to use the remainder of the term facility proceeds as well as any additional proceeds from the permanent financing expected in the second quarter of 2006 to fund the remaining 12 billion of repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program 

we believe that the cash that we expect to be generated by our operating activities together with our existing cash and shortterm investments will be sufficient to support our operations including our working capital capital expenditure and investment needs for the coming year additionally we believe this cash together with our current and future borrowing capabilities are sufficient to fund the anticipated repurchase of the remaining shares under the stock repurchase program 

in december 2005 we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to avago for approximately 26 billion in proceeds the divestiture includes approximately 6500 regular employees and operations in asia the us and europe in november 2005 we also completed the sale of our stake in lumileds lighting international bv lumileds to royal philips electronics for approximately 949 million plus repayment of approximately 51 million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest from lumileds 

other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancelable operating leases see note 19 commitments to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancelable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

on april 13 2005 standard  poors rating services sp raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of agilent to bb from bb revising their rating outlook to stable from positive on august 15 2005 sp raised its rating outlook on agilent to positive but left the companys corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings unchanged on november 23 2005 moodys investors service moodys affirmed their credit ratings of agilent leaving unchanged the senior implied debt rating of ba2 and the speculative grade liquidity rating of sgl1 moodys stable rating outlook for the company was also left unchanged 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax 

and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2005 including those related to discontinued operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions 

 operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property commitments under leases relating to discontinued operations totaled 23 million split as follows 6 million due within one year 11 million due in one to three years 5 million due in three to five years and 1 million due in five years or more 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancelable therefore only approximately 20 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers relating to our discontinued operations were 166 million and of these approximately 34 percent were firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments 

in addition to the above we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2005 the liability for our firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was 27 million compared with 16 million as of october 31 2004 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

other purchase commitments these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90day period without significant penalties 

retirement plans retirement plan funding includes the expected taxdeductible contribution planned for 2006 funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2005 or october 31 2004 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 70 percent of our revenues in 2005 70 percent of our revenues in 2004 and 69 percent of our revenues in 2003 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2005 and october 31 2004 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

competition

there is significant competition in the industries in which sequa operates and in several cases the competition consists of larger companies having substantially greater resources than sequa

chromalloy is a leader in the development and use of advanced metallurgical and other processes to repair manufacture and coat blades vanes and other components of gas turbine engines used for commercial and military jet aircraft chromalloys divisions compete for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the oems the oems generally have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements that allow it to repair certain components of engines the loss of approval by one of the major oems to repair components for such oems engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to it to mitigate this effect chromalloy competes on technical expertise and price

arc automotive is a secondtier automotive supplier that produces airbag inflators for firsttier airbag module airbag inflator and covers suppliers certain of whom have their own inflator capabilities the unit competes on the basis of product capability quality and price casco products is the worlds leading producer of cigarette lighters for both the original equipment market and the auto aftermarket and produces various electronic monitoring devices casco products competes on the basis of price quality and customer service

after six competes on the basis of design quality and price and sequa believes it is a leader in mens formalwear

raw materials

sequas businesses use a wide variety of raw materials and supplies generally these have been available in sufficient quantities to meet requirements although occasional shortages have occurred 

throughout 2004 and into the first quarter of 2005 domestic steel has been in short supply and steel prices have increased significantly due to a weak us dollar which makes imported products more expensive consolidation among us steel manufacturers and increased demand for steel particularly in the chinese market which has also caused shortages of the raw materials used in steel production certain steel manufacturers have placed their customers on allocation schedules the current situation has caused production volatility at precoat and modestly affected the manufacturing units of sequa that incorporate significant amounts of steel in their products  arc automotive and casco products of the automotive segment and megtec systems industrial machinery segment

precoat uses natural gas to fire the curing ovens used in the coating process as well as emission control devices natural gas costs for this unit increased in 2004 while 2003 costs approximated 2002 levels depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of precoats natural gas requirements to fixed rates at december 31 2004 there were no open natural gas swap contracts precoat entered into a natural gas swap on january 5 2005 with a notional value of 19 million to fix rates from february through april 2005

environmental matters

sequa has been notified that it has been named as a potentially responsible party under federal and state superfund laws andor has been named as a defendant in suits by private parties or governmental suits including private parties as codefendants with respect to sites currently or previously owned or operated by sequa or its predecessors or to which sequa or its predecessors may have sent hazardous wastes sequa is not presently aware of other such lawsuits or notices contemplated or planned by any private parties or environmental enforcement agencies the aggregate liability with respect to these matters net of liabilities already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet will not in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the financial position of sequa although adjustments to estimates based on improved knowledge of site conditions and chemical interactions with humans or changes in environmental law could have a significant impact on sequas results of operations in a particular period these environmental matters include the following

two propellant manufacturing facilities of the divested arc propulsion business have been identified to have soil and groundwater ammonium perchlorate ap contamination above the limit currently proposed by the us environmental protection agency for groundwater ap is a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel in 2001 sequa recorded an environmental charge that included 97 million of estimated costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ap with respect to the discontinued operation of the arc propulsion business aerojet which purchased the arc propulsion business in october 2003 has among other things assumed financial responsibility for future ap remediation at one facility camden arkansas arc is responsible for ap remediation at the second facility gainesville virginia and is using an emerging technology biodegradation to treat apaffected soil and groundwater in 2004 sequa recorded an additional 10 million charge with respect to environmental cleanup matters associated with the site based on an analysis of currently available information and previous experience with respect to hazardous substances it is possible that costs associated with the arc gainesville site may exceed current reserves although a range for possible additional costs cannot be reasonably estimated sequa has placed its insurance carriers on notice that a claim with respect to ap contamination will be filed and sequas present reserves do not consider possible recoveries from such carriers aerojets exposure to acquired arc propulsion environmental remediations costs  ap and other contamination associated with arcs prior operation of the business  is capped at 200 million after which arc is responsible for such costs based on its most recent estimates sequa believes that the costs to remediate the arc propulsion contamination exposures will not exceed the 200 million cap of financial responsibility assumed by aerojet

a number of claims have been filed in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in the vicinity of a predecessor corporation site which operated during the 1960s and early 1970s in dublin pennsylvania in october 1987 a class action was filed by residents of dublin against sequa and two other defendants the borough of dublin also filed suit seeking remediation of alleged contamination of the boroughs water supply and damages in an unspecified amount a settlement was reached in the class action in which sequa paid 18 million in 1997 the borough action was settled in 1998 when sequa paid 20 million to the borough and agreed to transfer to the borough the water treatment system it constructed the pennsylvania department of environmental protection entered into a consent decree with sequa in 1990 providing for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study with respect to the same alleged groundwater contamination in dublin the us environmental protection agency placed the site on the superfund list in 1990 and in conjunction therewith entered into a consent agreement with sequa on december 31 1990 the negotiation for the final remedy is still in progress

the state of florida issued an administrative order in 1988 requiring tct then a subsidiary of chromalloy to investigate and take appropriate corrective action in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in stuart florida the contamination is alleged to have arisen from a 1985 fire at tcts former facility in stuart the city of stuart subsequently constructed and is operating a groundwater remediation system sequa negotiated a conditional settlement with the city of stuart in october 1994 whereby it would contribute its pro rata share of the capital and operating costs for the groundwater treatment system on february 14 2000 the stuart city commission approved the execution of the settlement sequa estimates the amount to be paid in settlement plus additional groundwater sampling and analysis will be approximately 2 million to be paid over a tenyear period that began in the second quarter of 2000 in connection with the sale of tct in 2004 sequa agreed to retain this liability

in september 1993 14 homeowners in west nyack new york served a complaint on chromalloy and others alleging among other things that contamination from a former chromalloy site caused damage to their property all 14 homeowners agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in november 2002 the case was subsequently dismissed by the court chromalloy entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation on february 14 1994 to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study relating to the contamination in the vicinity of the former chromalloy site based on the findings of the study a dual phase extraction remedial system was started up in january 2003 it is scheduled to operate for five years

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in 2004 2003 and 2002 sequa recorded charges of 25 million 17 million and 03 million respectively to increase its accruals for remediation costs of the total 2004 charge 10 million was included in the results of discontinued operations and relates to the arc propulsion gainesville virginia facility at december 31 2004 the potential exposure for all remediation costs excluding financial liabilities assumed by aerojet is estimated to range from 120 million to 200 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 166 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 26 million in 2004 30 million in 2003 and 72 million in 2002 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 40 million and 60 million during 2005 and between 20 million and 30 million during 2006 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 10 million 11 million and 13 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 3 million in 2005 and 1 million in 2006 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were 92 million in 2004 93 million in 2003 and 86 million in 2002 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 9 million per year in 2005 and 2006

employment

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

operating results 20042003

sales

overall sales increased 20 in 2004 led by advances in the aerospace automotive specialty chemicals and industrial machinery segments sales of the metal coating segment increased modestly while the other products segment posted an 11 decline sales also benefited from the favorable effect of exchange rate changes which added approximately 635 million to sales for the year a detailed discussion of sales by operating segment follows

sales of the aerospace segment advanced 30 in the current year driven by the addition of sales from several new longterm contracts with airline customers these contracts give chromalloy the exclusive right to provide repairs replacement parts and inventory management on specific engines within the airlines fleet sales under the largest of these contracts accounted for approximately half of the segments increase chromalloy anticipates that these and other new programs will continue to add significantly to revenue growth the segment also benefited from a 33 increase in sales to marine and industrial turbine customers due to development and sales of high technology turbine components sales of engine overhaul services posted a 50 increase as a result of the segments entry into overhaul services on auxiliary power units military sales declined slightly reflecting the october 2004 sale of turbine airfoils division translation of foreign currency sales into us dollars added 192 million

sales of the automotive segment advanced 23 in the current year with both units in the segment contributing to the advance at the domestic operation of arc automotive the airbag inflator producer a 17 increase in volume led to higher sales despite the effect of lower average selling prices the european inflator operation also posted higher sales due to increased volume despite lower selling prices and the benefit of translating eurodenominated sales into us dollars approximately 68 million in the latter half of 2004 arc automotive was notified that an overseas enduser supplied through several of arcs customers was planning to resource certain supply contracts as a result management currently anticipates that sales in 2005 will be lower than in 2004 sales of casco products advanced 13 due to three principal factors increased sales of power outlets and electronic products at the units european operations the benefit of translating these sales into us dollars approximately 53 million and the addition of sales generated by a small canadian operation acquired during the year on a pro forma basis  excluding sales added through the acquisition  sales of casco products advanced 9

the metal coating segment posted modestly higher sales in 2004  a 2 improvement over 2003 the results reflect a higher volume of sales to the building products market as well as the effect of a price increase these factors were partially offset by a decline in sales under metal management programs lower sales to container products customers and the absence of sales recognized under a consulting contract that was completed in 2003 sales to manufactured products customers increased slightly across a broad range of end users and products in response to volatility in the domestic steel industry certain customers accelerated their purchases in 2004 to head off expected price increases or to take advantage of available steel in addition there has been increased competition from foreign suppliers of prepainted steel management anticipates these factors will lead to a softening of metal coating sales in the first quarter of 2005

sales of the specialty chemicals segment advanced 13 in 2004 due to three main factors the favorable effect of translating local currency results into us dollars approximately 241 million improved sales at the specialty chemicals distribution units and a continued high level of demand for the detergent additive taed the specialty chemicals distribution units benefited from the strength of the euro and the further development of their product portfolios

the industrial machinery segment which is composed solely of megtec systems posted a 22 sales increase in 2004 reflecting improvement in the worldwide graphic arts market higher sales of emission control equipment and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 82 million based on megtec systems yearend backlog position management anticipates that sales in the first half of 2005 will be strong

sales of the other products segment declined 11 in 2004 as a decline in sales at the after six unit was partially offset by higher revenues from centor sequas real estate holding company sales of after six reflect continuing intense competition in the formalwear market centor posted higher revenues due primarily to the inclusion of 12 months of rental income from office buildings in virginia that were formerly used in a now divested operation in addition centor benefited from the fourthquarter inclusion of the sequa can machinery building in its portfolio of properties

operating income

overall operating income advanced 67 led by strong advances at the aerospace and automotive segments as well as improvements at the metal coating specialty chemicals and industrial machinery segments the increase in operating income also reflects an 90 million decline in pension costs and the absence of 62 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2003 the effect of these factors was mitigated by higher corporate expenses sequas foreign operations contributed 614 million of operating income in 2004 compared with 442 million in 2003 profits of sequas foreign operations are driven by the results of the specialty chemicals operations the overseas operations of the automotive segment and the foreign units of the aerospace segment the advance in overseas profits for 2004 also reflects improvement at the overseas operations of the industrial machinery segment a detailed review of operating results by segment follows

in the aerospace segment operating profit advanced 81 in 2004 due to the following factors a higher level of sales and improved absorption particularly in the engine component repair operations and through the longterm service agreements which contribution would have been greater except for 82 million of significant upfront contract costs recognized in the first half of 2004 that will be recovered over the term of the contract absence of 27 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2003 lower pension expense which declined 35 million and lower inventory reserve provisions with sustained improvement in global airline traffic forecast for 2005 and with new longterm service agreements in place management anticipates that operating results will continue to trend higher in the next several quarters over the comparable 2004 periods

operating profit of the automotive segment more than doubled in 2004 with both units ahead for the year arc automotive benefited from higher sales and improved labor performance generated by ongoing operational excellence initiatives these factors were partially offset by higher research and development costs and increased raw material costs stemming from steel surcharges results of the italian unit also benefited from the strengthening of the euro in response to a decision by an overseas end user to resource its supply contracts beginning in the first half of 2005 arc automotive is realigning certain fixed assets to serve other markets and contracts in the fourth quarter of 2004 the italian inflator operation recorded an asset impairment charge of 41 million and a provision of 02 million for related severance costs management anticipates that additional personnelrelated costs of approximately 07 million will be recorded in 2005 casco products posted improved results in 2004 due to the following higher sales lower pension costs continuing operational excellence initiatives and the absence of 09 million of restructuring and related asset impairment charges recorded in 2003

operating income advanced 19 in the metal coating segment the increase reflects an improved mix of sales the benefits of ongoing six sigma programs the absence of a 28 million charge related to legal disputes recorded in 2003 and lower pension costs the favorable effect of these factors was tempered by higher selling and administrative costs increased natural gas and utility rates and the absence of profit added in 2003 by a nowcompleted international consulting contract

the specialty chemicals segment posted a 14 increase in operating income in 2004 due to the benefits of ongoing six sigma initiatives and the impact of translating local currency results into us dollars impact of approximately 31 million tempered by increased raw material costs the segment also benefited from improved results at the specialty chemicals distribution units generated in part through the use of lowcostregion sourcing

operating profit of the industrial machinery segment nearly tripled in 2004 as a result of the following factors the higher level of sales the absence of 29 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2003 the benefits gained through previous restructuring actions and improvements generated through operational excellence programs the improvement was tempered by higher steel costs

the other products segment posted an improvement of 07 million in 2004 primarily due to higher rental revenues at centor the real estate holding company the after six unit achieved a breakeven result for the year as a result of lower sales combined with higher inventory provisions

corporate expenses increased 111 million in 2004 due to several factors increased professional services costs related to sarbanesoxley compliance  higher insurance costs and higher incentive compensation provisions partially offset by lower pension expense

pension expense

operating income includes net periodic pension cost of 128 million in 2004 and 218 million in 2003 related to all significant funded defined benefit plans on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect current market conditions in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost the longterm expected rate of return in 2004 and 2003 was 83 the discount rate used was 6 in 2004 and 675 in 2003 net periodic pension cost declined in 2004 from 2003 despite a decline in the discount rate for the following reasons 1 sequa contributed 1027 million in 2003 primarily in the fourth quarter to its domestic plans which increased plan assets for subsequent expected returns 2 the performance of plan assets improved in 2003 compared with 2002 which increased plan assets for subsequent expected returns and 3 subsequent to the sale of arc propulsion business in october 2003 benefits were frozen for most employees covered by the atlantic research corporation employees pension plan in 2004 sequa contributed 291 million to its qualified pension plans

interest expense

interest expense increased by 38 million in 2004 compared with the prior year primarily due to the fullyear effect of the june 2003 issuance of 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008

in september 2004 us airways group inc us airways filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code chapter 11 the filing was the second time in two years that us airways has filed for protection under chapter 11 chromalloys prepetition trade receivable balance with us airways was not material in 2004 as well as in 2003 us airways accounted for less than 1 of chromalloys sales

at december 31 2004 trade and unbilled receivables due from major commercial airlines totaled approximately 880 million of which 433 million are from ual and 24 million are from us airways the difficult business conditions in the airline industry and the possibility of bankruptcy filings by other carriers who are customers of chromalloy could adversely affect the ability of chromalloy to realize some of these receivables

chromalloy competes for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the oems which generally have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements that allow it to repair certain components of engines the loss of a major oems approval to repair components for its engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to mitigate this effect

derivative and other financial instruments

sequa is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and from changes in the prices of certain commodities which affect its earnings cash flows and financial condition sequa manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financial activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments sequa has established a control environment which assigns senior executives and in certain instances operational management responsibility for risk assessment and the approval reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities sequa does not buy hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes sequas primary foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound and to the euro to mitigate the short and nearterm effect of changes in currency exchange rates sequa utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and derivatives thereof to manage its exposure to certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge forecasted transactions and firm commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of its natural gas requirements to fixed rates depending on the use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an efficient hedge gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of shareholders equity

a hypothetical 10 uniform decrease in all foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have decreased the fair value of sequas financial instruments by approximately 95 million as of december 31 2004 and 86 million as of december 31 2003 the sensitivity analysis relates only to sequas exchange ratesensitive financial instruments which include cash and debt amounts denominated in foreign currencies and all open foreign forward exchange contracts at december 31 2004 and 2003 the effect of this hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on the value of net assets other than financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and does not consider the effect this movement may have on anticipated foreign currency cash flows

at december 31 2004 and 2003 substantially all of sequas debt was at fixed rates and sequa currently does not hold interest rate derivative contracts accordingly a change in market interest rates would not materially affect sequas interest expense but would affect the fair value of sequas debt generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise the fair value of sequas total debt was approximately 884 million at december 31 2004 and 874 million at december 31 2003 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 296 million at december 31 2004 and 347 million at december 31 2003 a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 309 million at december 31 2004 and 365 million at december 31 2003 the fair value of sequas total debt is based primarily upon quoted market prices of sequas publicly traded securities the estimated changes in the fair values of sequas debt are based upon changes in the present value of future cash flows derived from the hypothetical changes in market interest rates

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities was 121 million in 2004 compared with cash used by operating activities of 423 million in 2003 the 544 million increase primarily reflects increased pretax earnings lower working capital requirements and lower levels of contributions to sequas defined benefit pension plans cash provided by investing activities was 32 million in 2004 compared with cash provided of 724 million in 2003 the 692 million decrease primarily reflects a 592 million decrease in proceeds from sale of businesses and the purchase of two small niche businesses cash used for financing activities was less than 01 million in 2004 compared with cash provided of 88 million in 2003 the 2003 period includes the receipt of 1010 million of net proceeds from the june 5 2003 issuance of 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 partially offset by the repurchase of receivables sold

revenue is recognized under the materialbythehour and the powerbythehour contracts based on the estimated fair value of units shipped recognition of revenue associated with unbilled receivables is limited to amounts contractually recoverable estimates of total contract revenues and costs are reviewed at a minimum each quarter risk factors affecting the overall revenue of the contract concern the usage of engines during the contract period future engine usage may be adversely affected by general economic slowdowns the fallout from possible terrorist attacks similar to those seen on september 11 2001 and possible complications related to certain customers emergence from bankruptcy

pensions

pension expense and pension liabilities are actuarially determined and are affected by managements assumptions with respect to the discount rate for obligations the future rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets pension expense and liabilities can also be affected by changes in plan benefits and the actual return on plan assets the discount rate is based on an analysis of discounted cash flows using an interest spot rate curve in conjunction with a further review of high and mediumgrade corporate longterm bond rates the rate of increase in compensation levels is based on managements assessment of the current and future economic environment and overall salary trends the expected longterm rate of return considers the allocation of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and economic and other indicators of future performance in addition sequa may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks changes in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as well as actual returns on plan assets that differ from the expected return can have a significant impact on pension expense and related liabilities

income taxes

sequa has significant domestic net operating loss carryforwards as well as deferred tax assets established through other comprehensive income in recording a minimum required pension liability management believes that such carryforwards and deferred tax assets will be utilized before their expiration through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future earnings and available tax planning strategies sequas ability to generate the expected amounts of domestic taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions the state of the airline industry and other major markets competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control there can be no assurance that sequa will meet its expectations for future domestic taxable income in the carryforward period or that available tax strategies can be enacted however management has considered the above factors in reaching the conclusion that it is more likely than not that future domestic taxable income and available tax strategies will be sufficient to fully realize the domestic operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets at december 31 2004

environmental sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

operating results 20032002

sales

overall sales increased 7 in 2003 driven by advances in the automotive metal coating industrial machinery and specialty chemicals segments tempered by a small decline at the aerospace segment sales benefited from the impact of exchange rate changes on translation of local currency results into us dollars approximately 656 million and 282 million of sales added through the addition of an acquired unit in the aerospace segment a detailed review of sales by operating segment follows

sales of the aerospace segment declined 2 in 2003 excluding the 282 million of sales added by the september 30 2002 acquisition of pacific gas turbine pgt an engine overhaul unit that was formerly an equity affiliate sales declined 6 in 2003 engine component repair sales declined 9 as a result of intense pricing pressure and the continuing downturn in the commercial aviation market and combined with a modest decline in sales to the us military more than offset increased sales to the industrial turbine market and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 152 million sales of units primarily engaged in the manufacture of original equipment components posted a modest increase as the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 65 million bolstered a small increase in sales to the commercial aviation market partially offset by lower sales to the us military

sales of the automotive segment increased 16 in 2003 with both units in the segment showing advances sales of arc automotive advanced 20 led by three factors a 15 increase in volume at the us operation broader product line offerings at the italian unit and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 90 million the casco products unit posted a sales advance of 10 in 2003 driven by improvements at the international units and the benefit of translating those sales into us dollars approximately 82 million

sales of the metal coating segment increased 12 in 2003 due to increased sales under metal management programs and improved sales to the building and manufactured products markets slightly offset by lower sales to the container products market the improvement in metal management programs reflects new programs at several customers to provide inventory management services the building and manufactured products sales increases reflect the impact of a price increase increased market share a modest improvement in the preengineered construction market and higher sales to the appliance and lighting fixture markets the sales to the container products market were lower due to the absence of sales to a customer whose inhouse coating line was temporarily shut down in 2002

sales of the specialty chemicals segment increased 22 in 2003 due to three main factors the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 154 million improved sales at the specialty chemicals distribution units and continued strength in demand for the detergent additive taed the specialty chemicals distribution units benefited from the strength of the euro and increased product offerings partially offset by softness in the european economy

sales of the industrial machinery segment increased 7 in 2003 the advance reflects improved sales at the units european operations an 11 increase in worldwide sales of spare parts and customer service and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 112 million the european sales reflect a slight pickup in sales to the graphic arts market and higher sales of emission control equipment on an overall basis this increase was offset by slightly lower equipment sales at both the us and asian operations 

sales of the other products segment declined 1 in 2003 primarily the result of a consolidated formalwear market and intense pricing pressure

operating income

overall operating income increased 21 in 2003 as advances at the automotive metal coating specialty chemicals and industrial machinery segments more than offset a sharp decline at the aerospace segment a 120 million increase in pension costs and increased restructuring and related asset impairment charges sequas foreign operations contributed operating income of 442 million in 2003 compared with 292 million in 2002 the profitability of sequas foreign operations is driven by the results of the specialty chemicals operations the overseas operations of the casco products unit of the automotive segment and the foreign units of the aerospace segment some of which derive a large portion of their earnings from the heavy industrial gas turbine aftermarket the advance in 2003 also reflects improvement at the foreign operations of arc automotive and the industrial machinery segment results of foreign operations also benefited from the impact of exchange rate changes on the translation of local currency results into us dollars approximately 30 million a detailed review of operating income by segment follows

operating income in the aerospace segment chromalloy declined 40 in 2003 as a result of lower sales and continued pricing pressure in the aftermarket for commercial aviation engine component repair losses recorded at the newly acquired engine overhaul unit restructuring charges related to workforce reductions and a plant consolidation 27 million in 2003 compared with 08 million in 2002 increased pension costs and a 07 million charge to reserve receivables from a foreign airline that filed for bankruptcy protection these factors were partially offset by 31 million of income relating to a dispute on contractual obligations in the commercial repair business and higher sales to the industrial turbine market results of units primarily engaged in the manufacture of original equipment components declined as a result of restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter

the automotive segment posted operating profit of 93 million in 2003 compared with a loss of 05 million in 2002 both units in the segment contributed to the advance results of arc automotive advanced 69 million in 2003 moving from a loss in the yearearlier period the improvement reflects the higher level of sales and royalty payments in 2003 benefits derived from ongoing six sigma initiatives and the strengthening of the euro these improvements were partially offset by increased research and development and pension costs operating income advanced 68 at the casco products unit driven by higher sales improvements generated by restructuring activities and operating efficiencies at the international units partially offset by restructuring and related asset impairment charges and increased pension costs at the us operations the restructuring charges related primarily to costs to transfer the units connecticut manufacturing operation to other lowercost facilities 

operating income advanced 14 in the metal coating segment the increase is driven by the higher level of sales and an improved mix operating efficiencies obtained through ongoing six sigma initiatives and profit added by the completion of an international consulting contract these factors were mitigated by a 28 million charge related to legal disputes and higher pension and insurance costs

the specialty chemicals segment posted a 34 increase in operating income in 2003 the advance was achieved as a result of the higher level of sales the strengthening of the euro and efficiencies obtained through the units six sigma program these benefits were further bolstered by the impact of translating local currency results into us dollars approximately 16 million these factors were partially offset by an increase in pension expense as well as increased raw material costs

the industrial machinery segment posted operating profit in 2003 whereas this segment recorded an operating loss in 2002 the improvement reflects higher sales the benefits of previous restructuring actions and efficiencies and cost controls generated by ongoing six sigma initiatives these factors were mitigated by 29 million of restructuring charges related to streamlining both european and us operations in response to the tight market environment 23 million in 2002 and higher pension costs

the after six unit of the other product segment posted a significant decline in profits in 2003 a reflection of the lower level of sales and the tight formalwear market lower margins and a 57 increase in pension costs

corporate expenses increased 6 in 2003 primarily a reflection of a 33 million increase in pension expense higher environmental cleanup provisions 17 million in 2003 03 million in 2002 and higher insurance costs partially offset by a lower provision for incentive compensation and the absence of a restructuring charge recorded in 2002

pension expense

operating income includes net periodic pension cost related to all significant domestic and foreign funded defined benefit plans of 218 million in 2003 compared with 98 million in 2002 on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect current market conditions in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost the longterm expected rate of return in 2003 was 83 compared with 90 in 2002 and the discount rate used in 2003 was 675 compared with 75 in 2002 as a result of these changes and the effect of a decline in the investment performance of its pension portfolios in 2002 net periodic pension cost more than doubled in 2003 compared with 2002

interest expense

interest expense increased by 47 million in 2003 compared with the prior year primarily due to the june 5 2003 issuance of 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008

interest income

interest income decreased by 09 million in 2003 compared with the prior year the decrease reflects a combination of lower interest rates and lower average levels of cash and cash equivalents the latter despite a large fourthquarter 2003 net increase related to the october 17 2003 receipt of 1330 million of cash proceeds on the sale of the arc propulsion business tempered by the december 3 2003 payment of a 750 million contribution to one of sequas defined benefit pension plans

equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures

managements report on internal control over financial reporting

sequas management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of sequas management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer sequa conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the framework in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on that evaluation management concluded that sequas internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2004 because of the effect of material weaknesses identified and more fully discussed below

deficiencies related to inadequate or ineffective policies and practices relating to revenue recognition on nonroutine transactions the repair parts units failed to consistently include financial personnel with adequate expertise in revenue recognition in the analysis of the impact that new customer contracts would have on the financial statements which creates a more than remote likelihood of a material misstatement of revenues

deficiencies related to the internal controls over financial reporting of an overhaul repair facility which accounted for approximately 2 of the companys consolidated assets and revenue as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 the deficiencies relate primarily to the aggregation of issues pertaining to revenue recognition account reconciliations and basic internal controls and controls surrounding the use of certain information technology applications these deficiencies create a more than remote likelihood of a material misstatement of revenues accounts receivable and inventories

the shareholders and board of directors of sequa corporation 

we have audited managements assessment that sequa corporation sequa or the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 because of the effect of material weaknesses identified and more fully discussed below pertaining to nonroutine revenue recognition transactions and deficiencies related to the internal controls over financial reporting of an overhaul repair facility based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso control criteria sequas management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating managements assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected the following material weaknesses have been identified and included in managements assessment

deficiencies related to inadequate or ineffective policies and practices relating to revenue recognition on nonroutine transactions the repair parts units failed to consistently include financial personnel with adequate expertise in revenue recognition in the analysis of the impact that new customer contracts would have on the financial statements which creates a more than remote likelihood of a material misstatement of revenues

deficiencies related to the internal controls over financial reporting of an overhaul repair facility which accounted for approximately 2 of the companys consolidated assets and revenue as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 the deficiencies relate primarily to the aggregation of issues pertaining to revenue recognition account reconciliations and basic internal controls and controls surrounding the use of certain information technology applications these deficiencies create a more than remote likelihood of a material misstatement of revenues accounts receivable and inventories

these material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated march 9 2005 on those financial statements 

in our opinion managements assessment that sequa corporation did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso control criteria also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria sequa corporation has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the coso control criteria

raw materials

sequas businesses use a wide variety of raw materials and supplies generally these have been available in sufficient quantities to meet requirements although occasional shortages have occurred 

in early 2004 a shortage of domestic steel has occurred and steel prices have increased significantly in the first two months of the year due to a weak us dollar which makes imported products more expensive consolidation among us steel manufacturers and increased demand for steel particularly in the chinese market which has also caused shortages of the raw materials used in steel production certain steel manufacturers have placed their customers on allocation schedules the current situation will cause production volatility at precoat and may impact those manufacturing units of sequa that incorporate significant amounts of steel in their products  arc automotive and casco products of the automotive segment and the megtec systems and sequa can machinery operations of the other products segment

precoat uses natural gas to fire the curing ovens used in the coating process as well as for emission control devices in 2003 and 2002 natural gas costs for this unit approximated 2000 levels in 2001 increases in the price paid for natural gas adversely affected operating income by approximately 28 million depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of precoats natural gas requirements to fixed rates at december 31 2003 a natural gas swap with a notional value of 15 million was in place to fix first quarter 2004 rates

environmental matters

sequa has been notified that it has been named as a potentially responsible party under federal and state superfund laws andor has been named as a defendant in suits by private parties or governmental suits including private parties as codefendants with respect to sites currently or previously owned or operated by sequa or its predecessors or to which sequa or its predecessors may have sent hazardous wastes sequa is not presently aware of other such lawsuits or notices contemplated or planned by any private parties or environmental enforcement agencies the aggregate liability with respect to these matters net of liabilities already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet will not in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the financial position of sequa although adjustments to estimates based on improved knowledge of site conditions and chemical interactions with humans or changes in environmental law could have a significant impact on sequas results of operations in a particular period these environmental matters include the following

two propellant manufacturing facilities of the divested arc propulsion business have been identified to have soil and groundwater ammonium perchlorate ap contamination above the limit currently proposed by the us environmental protection agency for groundwater ap is a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel in 2001 sequa recorded an environmental charge that included 97 million of estimated costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ap with respect to the discontinued operation of the arc propulsion business aerojet which purchased the arc propulsion business in october 2003 has assumed financial responsibility for future ap remediation at one facility camden arkansas arc is responsible for ap remediation at the second facility gainesville virginia and continues to use an emerging technology biodegradation to treat apaffected soil and groundwater aerojets exposure to acquired arc propulsion environmental remediations costs  ap and other contamination associated with arcs prior operation of the business  is capped at 200 million 

after which arc is responsible for such costs sequa believes its remediation costs were adequately reserved before the sale of the propulsion business based on its most recent estimates sequa believes that the costs to remediate the arc propulsion contamination exposures will not exceed the 200 million cap of financial responsibility assumed by aerojet

a number of claims have been filed in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in the vicinity of a predecessor corporation site which operated during the 1960s and early 1970s in dublin pennsylvania in october 1987 a class action was filed by residents of dublin against sequa and two other defendants the borough of dublin also filed suit seeking remediation of alleged contamination of the boroughs water supply and damages in an unspecified amount a settlement was reached in the class action in which sequa paid 18 million in 1997 the borough action was settled in 1998 when sequa agreed to transfer to the borough the water treatment system it constructed and paid 20 million to the borough the pennsylvania department of environmental protection entered into a consent decree with sequa in 1990 providing for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study with respect to the same alleged groundwater contamination in dublin the us environmental protection agency placed the site on the superfund list in 1990 and in conjunction therewith entered into a consent agreement with sequa on december 31 1990 the negotiation for the final remedy is still in progress

the state of florida issued an administrative order in 1988 requiring turbocombustor technology inc tct a subsidiary of chromalloy to investigate and to take appropriate corrective action in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in stuart florida the contamination is alleged to have arisen from a 1985 fire which occurred at tcts former facility in stuart the city of stuart subsequently constructed and is operating a groundwater remediation system sequa negotiated a conditional settlement with the city of stuart in october 1994 whereby it would contribute its prorata share of the capital and operating costs for the groundwater treatment system on february 14 2000 the stuart city commission approved the execution of the settlement sequa estimates the amount to be paid in settlement plus additional groundwater sampling and analysis will be approximately 2 million to be paid over a tenyear period which began in the second quarter of 2000

in september 1993 14 homeowners in west nyack new york served a complaint on chromalloy and others alleging among other things that contamination from a former chromalloy site caused damage to their property all 14 homeowners agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in november 2002 the case was subsequently dismissed by the court chromalloy entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation on february 14 1994 to undertake the remedial investigation and feasibility study relating to the contamination in the vicinity of the former chromalloy site based on the findings of the study a dual phase extraction remedial system was started up in january 2003 it is scheduled to operate for five years

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in 2003 2002 and 2001 sequa recorded charges of 17 million 03 million and 133 million respectively to increase its accruals for remediation costs the 2001 charge included 97 million of estimated cost to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap a raw material used in the manufacture of solid rocket propellant by the discontinued arc propulsion business although no federal or state environmental standards have been finalized for ap recent studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function prompted sequa to begin cleanup actions at its solid propellant facilities aerojet which purchased the arc propulsion business in october 2003 assumed financial responsibility subject to a 200 million cap for the remediation liability associated with one of the two facilities affected by ap contamination as well as financial responsibility for certain other remediation exposures at december 31 2003 the potential exposure for all remediation costs excluding financial liabilities assumed by aerojet is estimated to range from 12 million to 21 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 166 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 30 million in 2003 72 million in 2002 and 31 million in 2001 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 4 million and 6 million during 2004 and between 2 million and 4 million during 2005 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 11 million 13 million and 22 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 1 million per year in 2004 and 2005 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were 95 million in 2003 87 million in 2002 and 89 million in 2001 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 9 million per year in 2004 and 2005

employment

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition   and results of operations tableend 

operating results 20032002

sales

overall sales increased 8 in 2003 driven by advances in the automotive metal coating and specialty chemicals segments and the megtec systems and sequa can machinery units of the other products segment tempered by a small decline at the aerospace segment sales benefited from the impact of exchange rate changes on translation of local currency results into us dollars approximately 655 million and 282 million of sales added through the addition of an acquired unit in the aerospace segment a detailed review of sales by operating segment follows

sales of the aerospace segment declined 2 in 2003 excluding the 282 million of sales added by the september 30 2002 acquisition of pacific gas turbine pgt an engine overhaul unit that was formerly an equity affiliate sales declined 6 in 2003 engine component repair sales declined 9 as a result of intense pricing pressure and the continuing downturn in the commercial aviation market and combined with a modest decline in sales to the us military more than offset increased sales to the industrial turbine market and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 152 million sales of units primarily engaged in manufacture of original equipment components posted a modest increase as the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 65 million bolstered a small increase in sales to the commercial aviation market partially offset by lower sales to the us military chromalloy has recently moved to strengthen its ties to certain airline customers by entering into several longterm maintenance contracts in september 2003 chromalloy signed a 10year material bythehour contract with a major us airline the contract represents new business growth of approximately 10 and is expected to begin to contribute repair revenues in the first quarter of 2004 several other contracts with major international airlines have recently been signed management anticipates that these contracts will add significantly to revenue in 2004

sales of the automotive segment increased 16 in 2003 with both units in the segment showing advances sales of arc automotive advanced 20 led by three factors a 15 increase in volume at the us operation broader product line offerings at the italian unit and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 90 million the casco products unit posted a sales advance of 10 in 2003 driven by improvements at the international units and the benefit of translating those sales into us dollars approximately 82 million

sales of the metal coating segment increased 12 in 2003 due to increased sales under metal management programs and improved sales to the building and manufactured products markets slightly offset by lower sales to the container products market the improvement in metal management programs reflects new programs at several customers to provide inventory management services the building and manufactured products sales increases reflect the impact of a price increase increased market share a modest improvement in the preengineered construction market and higher sales to the appliance and lighting fixture markets the sales to the container products market were lower due to the absence of sales to a customer whose inhouse coating line was temporarily shut down in 2002

sales of the specialty chemicals segment increased 22 in the current year due to three main factors the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 154 million improved sales at the specialty chemicals distribution units and continued strength in demand for the detergent additive taed the specialty chemicals distribution units benefited from the strength of the euro and increased product offerings partially offset by softness in the european economy

sales of the other products segment increased 12 in 2003 driven by improvements at two of the three units in the segment sales of the megtec systems unit increased 7 in 2003 the advance reflects improved sales at the units european operations an 11 increase in worldwide sales of spare parts and customer service and the benefit of translating local currency sales into us dollars approximately 112 million the european sales reflect a slight pickup in sales to the graphic arts market and higher sales of emission control equipment on an overall basis this increase was offset by slightly lower equipment sales at both the us and asian operations based on this units yearend backlog position management anticipates that sales in the first half of 2004 will advance over the comparable 2003 period sales of the sequa can machinery unit posted a 27 improvement driven by strong sales of can forming equipment in 2003 the unit also benefited from improved sales of can decorating kits and specialty can systems backlog however was down 62 at yearend at this unit primarily reflecting weakness in the equipment market in the second half of 2003 as a result management anticipates that sales for this unit will be weak in the first part of 2004 sales of the after six unit declined 2 in 2003 primarily the result of a consolidated formalwear market and intense pricing pressure this units yearend backlog reflects a 30 decline from 2002 as a result management anticipates that sales for this unit will be weak in the first half of 2004

operating income

overall operating income increased 17 in 2003 as advances at the automotive metal coating and specialty chemicals segments and the megtec systems and sequa can machinery units of the other products segment more than offset a sharp decline at the aerospace segment a 127 million increase in pension costs and increased restructuring and related asset impairment charges sequas foreign operations contributed operating income of 438 million in 2003 compared with 292 million in 2002 the profitability of sequas foreign operations is driven by the results of the specialty chemicals operations the overseas operations of the casco products unit of the automotive segment and the foreign units of the aerospace segment some of which derive a large portion of their earnings from the heavy industrial gas turbine aftermarket the advance in 2003 also reflects improvement at the foreign operations of arc automotive and the megtec systems unit results of foreign operations also benefited from the impact of exchange rate changes on the translation of local currency results into us dollars approximately 30 million a detailed review of operating income by segment follows

operating income in the aerospace segment chromalloy gas turbine declined 38 in 2003 as a result of lower sales and continued pricing pressure in the aftermarket for commercial aviation engine component repair losses recorded at the newly acquired engine overhaul unit restructuring charges related to workforce reductions and a plant consolidation 27 million in 2003 compared with 08 million in 2002 increased pension costs and a 07 million charge to reserve receivables from a foreign airline that filed for bankruptcy protection these factors were partially offset by 31 million of income relating to a dispute on contractual obligations in the commercial repair business and higher sales to the industrial turbine market results of units primarily engaged in the manufacture of original equipment components declined as a result of restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter and lower sales to the us military

the automotive segment posted operating profit of 93 million in 2003 compared with a loss of 05 million in 2002 both units in the segment contributed to the advance results of arc automotive advanced 69 million in 2003 moving from a loss in the year earlier period the improvement reflects the higher level of sales and royalty payments in 2003 benefits derived from ongoing six sigma initiatives and the strengthening of the euro these improvements were partially offset by increased research and development and pension costs operating income advanced 68 at the casco products unit driven by higher sales improvements generated by restructuring activities and operating efficiencies at the international units partially offset by restructuring and related asset impairment charges and increased pension costs at the us operations the restructuring charges related primarily to costs to transfer the units connecticut manufacturing operation to other lower cost facilities 

operating income advanced 14 in the metal coating segment the increase is driven by the higher level of sales and an improved mix operating efficiencies obtained through ongoing six sigma initiatives and profit added by the completion of an international consulting contract these factors were mitigated by a 28 million charge related to legal disputes and higher pension and insurance costs

the specialty chemicals segment posted a 34 increase in operating income in 2003 the advance was achieved as a result of the higher level of sales the strengthening of the euro and efficiencies obtained through the units six sigma program these benefits were further bolstered by the impact of translating local currency results into us dollars approximately 16 million these factors were partially offset by an increase in pension expense as well as increased raw material costs

the other products segment posted operating profit in 2003 whereas this segment recorded an operating loss in 2002 the improvement reflects a turnaround at the megtec systems unit which posted a modest profit in the current year the improvement reflects higher sales the benefits of previous restructuring actions and efficiencies and cost controls generated by ongoing six sigma initiatives these factors were mitigated by 29 million of restructuring charges related to streamlining both european and us operations in response to the tight market environment 23 million in 2002 and higher pension costs the sequa can machinery unit posted a 36 increase in profits in 2003 stemming from the higher level of sales and improved absorption primarily in the first half of the year the second half of the year was marked by a lower level of equipment sales and absorption management expects this trend to continue in the first half of 2004 as evidenced by a lower level of yearend backlog in 2003 in addition the unit was negatively impacted by a 67 increase in pension costs in 2003 the after six unit posted a significant decline in profits in 2003 a reflection of the lower level of sales and the tight formalwear market lower margins and a 57 increase in pension costs

corporate expenses increased 6 in 2003 primarily a reflection of a 33 million increase in pension expense higher environmental cleanup provisions 17 million in 2003 03 million in 2002 and higher insurance costs partially offset by a lower provision for incentive compensation and the absence of a restructuring charge recorded in 2002

in early 2004 a shortage of domestic steel has occurred and steel prices have increased significantly in the first two months of the year due to a weak us dollar which makes imported products more expensive consolidation among us steel manufacturers and increased demand for steel particularly in the chinese market which has also caused shortages of the raw materials used in steel production certain steel manufacturers have placed their customers on allocation schedules the current situation will cause production volatility at precoat and may impact those 

manufacturing units of sequa that incorporate significant amounts of steel in their products  arc automotive and casco products of the automotive segment and the megtec systems and sequa can machinery operations of the other products segment

pension expense

operating income includes net periodic pension cost related to all significant domestic and foreign funded defined benefit plans of 237 million in 2003 compared with 110 million in 2002 on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect current market conditions in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost the longterm expected rate of return in 2003 was 83 compared with 90 in 2002 and the discount rate used in 2003 was 675 compared with 75 in 2002 as a result of these changes and the effect of a decline in the investment performance of its pension portfolios in 2002 net periodic pension cost more than doubled in 2003 compared with 2002

interest expense

interest expense increased by 47 million in 2003 compared with the prior year primarily due to the june 5 2003 issuance of 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008

interest income

interest income decreased by 09 million in 2003 compared with the prior year the decrease reflects a combination of lower interest rates and lower average levels of cash and cash equivalents the latter despite a large fourthquarter 2003 net increase related to the october 17 2003 receipt of 1330 million of cash proceeds on the sale of the arc propulsion business tempered by the december 3 2003 payment of a 750 million contribution to one of sequas defined benefit pension plans

equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures

sequa has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures which amounted to 592 million and 425 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures was income of 97 million in 2003 and a loss of 01 million in 2002

chromalloy is a partner in joint ventures aimed at strengthening its ties to certain original equipment manufacturers and airline customers as well as ensuring close cooperation with respect to the dissemination of technical specifications and requirements sequas investment in chromalloys joint ventures was 573 million and 406 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the combination of income and losses of chromalloys joint ventures was income of 97 million in 2003 and 03 million in 2002 the largest of the chromalloy joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs

in the second quarter of 2003 chromalloy and siemens westinghouse power corporation and siemens aktiengesellschaft collectively referred to as siemens established a global cooperation consisting of joint ownership of three operating companies providing service and repairs for heavy industrial gas turbines manufactured by other companies and for gas turbines based on the mature technologies of siemens and its affiliates the three operating companies are turbocare gas turbine services llc tcgts turbine services ltd ts and gas turbine technologies spa gtt

chromalloy has a 49 ownership interest in tcgts chromalloy and siemens contributed at existing ownership levels a division of their existing tacr joint venture siemens also contributed a us operation and a minority interest in a venezuelan subsidiary to tcgts tcgts serves the north central and south american markets the remaining operations of tacr of which chromalloy owns 49 continue to provide coating and component repair services on siemens advanced engines

effect of a change in accounting principle

on january 1 2002 sequa adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 the statement changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach

sfas no 142 establishes specific guidelines for use in evaluating the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 142 goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized if the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit

sequa completed the transitional impairment review required under sfas no 142 and recorded effective january 1 2002 a noncash charge related to continuing operations of 130 million net of a related tax benefit on deductible goodwill of 78 million as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations the transitional charge related to continuing operations was for the arc automotive 31 million reporting unit of the automotive segment and the megtec systems 91 million and after six 08 million reporting units of the other products segment the effect of the change in accounting principle relating to continuing operations reduced basic earnings per share by 125 in 2002 a noncash aftertax charge of 1018 million relating to the arc propulsion business was 

reclassified to the results of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations the fair value of sequas reporting units was measured using an income approach based on a present value technique of estimated expected future cash flows

pursuant to sfas no 142 goodwill is to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis sequa has selected october 1 as the date for subsequent reviews sequa reviewed its goodwill as of october 1 2003 and 2002 and determined that no further impairment of goodwill had occurred despite the difficult economic environment confronting the aerospace segment management believes that the absence of impairment on the segments recorded goodwill of 1116 million reflects the positive longterm outlook for the industry and chromolloys inherent value as the major independent aircraft engine repair alternative to the oems

income loss from discontinued operations

on october 17 2003 sequa through its arc subsidiary completed the sale of substantially all of the assets  including the shares of arc uk limited  and certain of the liabilities related to the propulsion business of arc collectively referred to as the arc propulsion business the sale to aerojet was pursuant to an agreement entered into by arc on may 2 2003 arc received 1330 million in cash subject to certain adjustments arc automotive sequas automotive airbag inflator operation was not included in the sale to aerojet aerojet has entered into a longterm supply contract and license agreement to provide propellant and propellant development to arc automotive 

arc propulsion income included in discontinued operations and per basic share amounts of 35 million or 033 in 2003 and 75 million or 072 in 2002 income from discontinued operations also includes a 1018 million aftertax charge for the 2002 effect of a change in accounting principle 978 per basic share related to the operations of the arc propulsion business the 2003 sale of the arc propulsion business resulted in an additional preliminary aftertax gain of 31 million or 030 per basic share

sequas remaining investment in discontinued operations primarily relates to a leveraged lease portfolio that will be liquidated over the next 11 years as rentals are received and residual values are realized the leveraged lease cash flow stream including residual proceeds services the payment of principal and interest on a nonrecourse loan that securitized the lease portfolio and which will be repaid in 2004

sequas investment in the leveraged lease portfolio is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the continuing creditworthiness of the various lessees certain of the leases concern aircraft leased to major commercial airlines including one with united airlines ual in december 2002 ual filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in december 2002 sequa recorded an 110 million aftertax charge of which 63 million related to the writeoff of the net investment in the ual lease the balance of the aftertax charge related to a permanent decline in the realizability of remaining aircraft residual values the effect of this aftertax charge from discontinued operations reduced basic earnings per share by 105 in 2002

riskconcentration of business

sequas largest operation chromalloy gas turbine corporation 2003 sales and operating income of 6641 million and 280 million respectively and total assets at december 31 2003 of 8492 million has experienced significant difficulties in its operating environment since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 which had a severe and extended impact on the airline industry compounded by the general economic slowdown the downturn in air travel has had a significant impact on chromalloys repair and original equipment component manufacturing operations which derived approximately 80 of their 2003 sales from the commercial aviation market the large repair business is directly related to the number of hours jet engines are flown and the original equipment component manufacturing business is related to the number of new jet engines placed in service the economic impact on chromalloy has been partially offset by costcutting measures in light of the continuing difficulties and intense pricing pressures in the commercial airline market a return to the preseptember 11 2001 level of operating income is not expected in 2004

in march 2003 standard  poors ratings services sp placed its ratings on 12 airlines on creditwatch with negative implications sp cited the then impending war with iraq and its estimation that already weak airlines would incur substantial losses and cash outflow due to declines in air travel while the duration of the war was short the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars resulted in certain airlines temporarily reducing service to regions affected by the disease the longterm effect on air travel from the iraq war sars and continuing terror threats is uncertain at this time

on april 1 2003 air canada filed for protection under canadas companies creditors arrangements act air canada is continuing operations while it restructures in 2003 air canada accounted for less than 1 of chromalloys sales a firstquarter charge of 07 million was incurred to reserve the trade receivables balance with air canada

ual which filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in december 2002 accounted for approximately 29 million or 4 of chromalloys sales in 2003 4 of annual sales in 2002 the prepetition net trade accounts receivable balance is nominal and the impact of the ual filing on chromalloys operations has not been significant in september 2003 chromalloy signed a 10year engine maintenance by the hour contract with ual the contract represents new business growth of approximately 10 in sales and is expected to begin to contribute repair revenues in the first quarter of 2004 

at december 31 2003 trade receivables due from major commercial airlines totaled approximately 45 million the difficult business conditions in the airline industry and the possibility of bankruptcy filings by other carriers who are customers of chromalloy could adversely affect the ability of chromalloy to realize some of these receivables

chromalloy competes for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the original equipment manufacturers oems the oems generally have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements which allow it to repair certain components of engines the loss of a major oems approval to repair components for its engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to mitigate this effect

sequa is engaged in the automotive airbag inflator business through arc automotive arc automotives largest customers for airbag inflators are delphi automotive systems and its subsidiaries delphi and key safety systems inc formerly breed technologies inc and its subsidiaries key safety delphi accounted for 672 million or 34 of arc automotives sales in 2003 and 439 million or 27 of sales in 2002 key safety accounted for approximately 727 million or 37 of arc automotives sales in 2003 and 761 million or 47 of sales in 2002

precoat markets its coating services to steel and aluminum producers and distributors building products manufacturers merchant can makers and manufacturers of other diverse products the steel manufacturers have experienced difficult economic pressures and the industry is undergoing a period of consolidation precoat has worked to insulate its accounts receivable exposure while precoat primarily acts as a toll coater for its steel mill customers and therefore does not own significant stores of coil inventory to serve this market the operation has become more active in offering steel inventory management programs

in april 2003 national steel precoats largest customer was acquired by us steel the combination of national steel and us steel accounted for approximately 919 million or 35 of precoats 2003 sales 39 of 2002 annual sales the acquisition of national steel by us steel has not significantly affected precoat

in the specialty chemicals segment one customer accounted for 32 of 2003 sales 30 of 2002 annual sales and the top three customers accounted for 47 of 2003 sales 45 of 2002 annual sales all of these customers are international consumer products companies with whom warwick has been doing business for many years

sequas assets of discontinued operations includes a leveraged lease portfolio that is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the creditworthiness of the lessees several of the leases are for aircraft leased to major commercial airlines whose industry is experiencing difficult conditions at december 31 2003 sequas remaining net investment in aircraft leases with major commercial airlines totaled 358 million of which 167 million relates to american airlines inc 154 million relates to delta airlines inc and 37 million relates to continental airlines inc

derivative and other financial instruments

sequa is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and from changes in the prices of certain commodities which impact its earnings cash flows and financial condition sequa manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financial activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments sequa has established a control environment which assigns senior executives and in certain instances operational management responsibility for risk assessment and the approval reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities sequa does not buy hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes sequas primary foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound and to the euro to mitigate the short and nearterm effect of changes in currency exchange rates sequa utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and derivatives thereof to manage its exposure to certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge forecasted transactions and firm commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of its natural gas requirements to fixed rates depending on the 

use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an efficient hedge gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of shareholders equity

a hypothetical 10 uniform decrease in all foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have decreased the fair value of sequas financial instruments by approximately 86 million as of december 31 2003 and 119 million as of december 31 2002 the sensitivity analysis relates only to sequas exchange ratesensitive financial instruments which include cash and debt amounts denominated in foreign currencies and all open foreign forward exchange contracts at december 31 2003 and 2002 the effect of this hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on the value of net assets other than financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and does not consider the effect this movement may have on anticipated foreign currency cash flows

at december 31 2003 and 2002 substantially all of sequas debt was at fixed rates and sequa currently does not hold interest rate derivative contracts accordingly a change in market interest rates would not materially affect sequas interest expense but would affect the fair value of sequas debt generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise the fair value of sequas total debt was approximately 874 million at december 31 2003 and 672 million at december 31 2002 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 347 million at december 31 2003 and 296 million at december 31 2002 a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 365 million at december 31 2003 and 314 million at december 31 2002 the fair value of sequas total debt is based primarily upon quoted market prices of sequas publicly traded securities the estimated changes in the fair values of sequas debt are based upon changes in the present value of future cash flows as derived from the hypothetical changes in market interest rates the december 31 2003 values include 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 which were issued on june 5 2003

environmental matters

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in 2003 2002 and 2001 sequa recorded charges of 17 million 03 million and 133 million respectively to increase its accruals for remediation costs the 2001 charge included 97 million of estimated cost to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap a raw material used in the manufacture of solid rocket propellant by the discontinued arc propulsion business although no federal or state environmental standards have been finalized for ap recent studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function prompted sequa to begin cleanup actions at its solid propellant facilities aerojet which purchased the arc propulsion business in october 2003 assumed financial responsibility subject to a 200 million cap for the remediation liability associated with one of the two facilities affected by ap contamination as well as financial responsibility for certain other arc propulsion remediation exposures sequa believes its remediation costs were adequately reserved prior to the sale of the propulsion business based on its most recent estimates sequa believes that the costs to remediate the arc propulsion contamination exposures will not exceed the 200 million cap of financial responsibility assumed by aerojet at december 31 2003 the potential exposure for all remediation costs excluding financial liabilities assumed by aerojet is estimated to range from 12 million to 21 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 166 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 30 million in 2003 72 million in 2002 and 31 million in 2001 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 4 million and 6 million during 2004 and between 2 million and 4 million during 2005 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 11 million 13 million and 22 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 1 million per year in 2004 and 2005 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were 95 million in 2003 87 million in 2002 and 89 million in 2001 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 9 million per year during 2004 and 2005

backlog

the businesses of sequa for which backlogs are significant are the turbine airfoils turbocombustor technology and castings units of the aerospace segment and the sequa can machinery megtec systems and after six units of the other products segment the aggregate dollar amount of backlog in these units was 1877 million at december 31 2003 and 1630 million at december 31 2002 increases in backlog in the aerospace segment and in the megtec systems unit were partially offset by decreases in backlog in the sequa can machinery and after six units sales of after six are seasonal with stronger sales in the first six months of the year accordingly this units backlog is normally higher at december 31 than at any other time of the year

liquidity and capital resources

net cash used for operating activities was 562 million in 2003 compared with cash provided by operating activities of 795 million in 2002 the 1357 million decrease primarily reflects increased contributions to sequas defined benefit pension plans higher working capital requirements lower levels of cash provided by discontinued operations and an increase in taxes paid cash provided by investing activities was 861 million in 2003 compared with cash used of 867 million in 2002 the 1728 million increase primarily reflects the 1330 million of proceeds required from the sale of the arc propulsion business lower levels of capital spending the absence of funds expended for the purchase of a business in 2002 and lower levels of cash collateral required by an insurance carrier cash provided by financing activities was 88 million in 2003 compared with 85 million in 2002 the 2003 period includes the receipt of 1010 million of net proceeds from the june 5 2003 issuance of 100 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 partially offset by the repurchase of receivables sold the 2002 period primarily reflects an increase in accounts receivable sold 

in 2003 sequa contributed 1027 million to its domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans the total includes 750 million contributed on december 3 2003 to sequas largest defined benefit plan the december 3 2003 contribution represented the estimated difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the value of plan assets due to its pension contributions as well as a significant improvement in the equity markets sequa recorded 471 million of income net of tax through other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity representing a partial reversal of the minimum required pension liability recorded in prior years

on october 17 2003 sequa through its arc subsidiary completed the sale of substantially all of the assets  including the shares of arc uk limited  and certain of the liabilities related to the propulsion business of arc collectively referred to as the arc propulsion business the sale to aerojet was pursuant to an agreement entered into by arc on may 2 2003 arc automotive sequas automotive airbag inflator operation was not included in the sale to aerojet aerojet has entered into a longterm supply contract and license agreement to provide propellant and propellant development to arc automotive the sale price was 1330 million in cash subject to certain adjustments management is utilizing the proceeds to strengthen sequas financial position

on june 5 2003 sequa completed an offering of 100 million of series a 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 through a private placement under rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act net proceeds received on the 8 78 senior notes offering which were sold at a premium of 1025 for an effective yield of 823 amounted to 1010 million and are being used for general corporate purposes the notes are part of a single series of 8 78 senior notes of which 200 million were issued in 2001 on september 19 2003 sequa completed its offer to exchange all outstanding series a 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 that were issued on june 5 2003 for up to 100 million of registered series b 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 all 100 million of outstanding notes were exchanged the terms of the new series b 8 78 senior notes  including principal amount interest rate maturity security and ranking  are substantially the same as the terms of the original notes with the principal exception that the new notes are registered under the securities act

in anticipation of sequas 100 million 8 78 senior notes offering moodys downgraded its ratings on sequa debt from ba3 to b1 and changed its rating outlook from negative to stable sp affirmed its bb rating with a negative outlook but removed sequa from creditwatch where it was placed in march 2003 fitch ratings downgraded its ratings on sequas debt from bb to b and changed its rating outlook from negative to stable

sequas ability to obtain letters of credit and surety bonds for financial guarantees had been limited due both to debt ratings that are below investment grade and to the absence of a secured bank credit agreement in september 2003 sequa finalized a 50 million facility with a major global bank for the issuance of letters of credit the facility which is secured by assets of the specialty chemicals segment is subject to a net worth covenant with respect to the segment the facility requires an initial cash collateral balance of 50 million british pounds increasing to 150 million british pounds by 2006 in late 2002 sequa had deposited 84 million with an insurance carrier when the surety market for financial guarantees became extremely tight and sequa was unable to renew a surety bond the amount was returned to sequa upon the issuance of a letter of credit under the new facility in april 2003 sequa deposited 47 million with an insurance carrier to guarantee certain environmental remediation costs the policy can be canceled upon sequa satisfying certain environmental protection agency required financial ratios or the issuance of a letter of credit however this policy may be canceled only on an annual anniversary of the 47 million 42 million plus interest earned on the deposit less any claims paid is refundable

significant accounting policies and estimates

sequa believes that the application of the following accounting policies is important to its financial position and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of sequas significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

allowance for doubtful accounts

certain of sequas operating segments provide services to industries that are or have been experiencing difficult economic pressures the aerospace segment performs repair and other services for the commercial airline industry and the metal coating segment counts major steel mills among its customers see the riskconcentration of business section of this mda of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion many of sequas customers are large wellknown companies and the customer base is monitored through a review of account balance agings an assessment of customer financial condition and interactions with the customers reserves are established through a combination of specific identification of problem accounts and percentages of aging brackets

inventory valuation

the aerospace segment chromalloy gas turbine maintains significant inventories of parts to serve the repair market in order to ensure that any obsolete or slowmoving inventory is properly identified and valued chromalloy has in place a policy that mandates minimum writedown requirements based on usage the policy provides for a consistent and systematic approach to valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market with inventory values reassessed quarterly and at yearend for adequacy the decline in air travel and the related reduction in the number of hours jet engines are flown have had an unfavorable impact on inventory valuations a further decline in air travel would have an additional unfavorable impact management believes that while demand for certain repair services and manufactured parts has been volatile during the past year and can remain volatile while the industry is disrupted the longterm outlook for the industry is positive

goodwill

sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis sequa recorded a 130 million aftertax transitional impairment charge related to continuing operations effective with the january 1 2002 adoption of sfas no 142 sequa updated its review of goodwill on its selected annual test dates of october 1 2003 and 2002 and noted no further impairment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit if these estimates and assumptions change in the future due to such factors as a decline in general economic conditions a longterm or permanent decline in air travel competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control an impairment charge may be required details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k and are incorporated herein by reference

pensions

pension expense and pension liabilities are actuarially determined and are affected by managements assumptions with respect to the discount rate for obligations the future rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets pension expense and liabilities can also be affected by changes in plan benefits and the actual return on plan assets the annual discount rate is based on a review of high and mediumgrade corporate longterm bond rates the rate of increase in compensation levels is based on managements assessment of the current and future economic environment and overall salary trends the expected longterm rate of return considers the allocation of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and economic and other indicators of future performance in addition sequa may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks declines in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as well as actual returns on plan assets that are below the expected return can have a significant impact on pension expense and related liabilities

income taxes

sequa has significant domestic net operating loss carryforwards as well as deferred tax assets established through other comprehensive income in recording a minimum required pension liability management believes that such carryforwards and deferred tax assets will be utilized before their expiration through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future earnings and available tax planning strategies sequas ability to generate the expected amounts of domestic taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions the state of the airline industry and other major markets competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control there can be no assurance that sequa will meet its expectations for future domestic taxable income in the carryforward period or that available tax strategies can be enacted however management has considered the above factors in reaching the conclusion that it is more likely than not that future domestic taxable income and available tax strategies will be sufficient to fully realize the domestic operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets at december 31 2003

environmental sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

operating results 20022001

sales

overall sales declined 5 in 2002 driven primarily by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and at the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment the effect of these declines was tempered by advances in the automotive and specialty chemicals segments a detailed review of sales for each segment follows

the 10 decline in sales in the aerospace segment was due primarily to the continuing downturn in the worldwide commercial aviation industry engine repair sales declined 11 13 excluding 81 million of sales of pacific gas turbine pgt a former equity affiliate which became wholly owned on september 30 2002 as an increase in sales to the us military and the benefit of translating foreign currency sales into us dollars approximately 48 million was more than offset by the poor conditions in the worldwide commercial airline industry the military sales advance was primarily driven by revenues from a contract to provide component repairs at kelly air force base sales of original equipment components declined 7 as increases in sales to the industrial turbine and us military markets and a favorable impact of approximately 26 million from translation of foreign currency results to us dollars was more than offset by the weak commercial aviation market

sales of the automotive segment advanced 6 in 2002 with similar increases at both arc automotive and casco products sales of automotive airbag inflators advanced reflecting increased volumes and the benefit of translating foreign sales into us dollars approximately 23 million which more than offset an unfavorable shift to lower priced new products casco products sales increased primarily due to advances at the units foreign operations

sales of the metal coating segment declined 3 in 2002 with declines in building and manufactured products tempered by a modest advance in container products the yearoveryear decline primarily reflects a 13 decline in the fourth quarter with sales in each of the three major market segments off from the prior year quarter sales to the building products market were down slightly in 2002 reflecting weakness in the preengineered sector of the commercial construction market partially offset by the impact of sales from a former equity affiliate midwest metal coatings which was consolidated in mid2001 modest advances in sales to the container market were driven by increased demand from the beverage industry while a small decline in sales to the manufactured products area primarily reflects weakness in transportation and lighting sectors

sales of the specialty chemicals segment advanced 12 in 2002 7 in local currency due to three principal factors stronger demand for the detergent additive taed sales added through the june 2001 acquisition of a specialty chemicals marketing unit and the favorable effect of the weakening of the us dollar on the translation of local currency results approximately 70 million

sales of the other products segment declined 10 in 2002 as advances at the can machinery units were more than offset by declines at megtec systems and after six sales of megtec systems declined 15 24 excluding sales added by a september 2001 acquisition of the roll handling group the decline reflects the continuing weak condition of the worldwide graphic arts market sales of the can machinery unit registered a 6 advance in 2002 with increased sales of the candecorating and specialty can systems product lines more than offsetting lower sales of canforming equipment fourthquarter sales more than doubled compared with 2001 with all product lines contributing to the advance and the unit finished the year with a strong backlog position sales of the after six formalwear unit declined 11 in 2002 reflecting a drop in demand sales in the fourth quarter advanced 41 compared with an unusually low prior year quarter due to a post september 11 downturn in 2001

operating income

overall operating income increased 153 million or 46 in 2002 on an operating basis significant improvements at the automotive and specialty chemicals segment and at two of the three units of the other products segment were partially offset by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment as well as increased expenses in the corporate segment other major factors in the advance were lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges 45 million in 2002 compared with 224 million in 2001 the cessation of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 142 77 million and lower environmental cleanup provisions 03 million in 2002 compared with 36 million in 2001 the amounts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges recorded in 2002 and 2001 and the goodwill amortization in 2001 are summarized as follows

 

a detailed review of operating results by business segment follows

operating income in the aerospace segment declined 32 in 2002 as the impact of continuing intense pressure on the commercial airline industry in 2002 was tempered by the absence of goodwill amortization lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges and the favorable effect of translating foreign currency results into us dollars approximately 07 million excluding these factors profits of the chromalloy gas turbine units primarily engaged in engine component repair were unfavorably affected by the following factors the decline in sales to the commercial aviation market increased inventory provisions primarily related to slowmoving inventory startup costs related to a new unit offering repairs of auxiliary power units and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in 2001 these factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost reductions and restructuring actions as well as higher sales to the us military results of units primarily engaged in the manufacture of original equipment components were also negatively affected by lower volume an unfavorable sales mix shift and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in 2001 partially offset by a sharp reduction in operating expenses

operating loss in the automotive segment was 05 million in 2002 and 173 million in 2001 arc automotive significantly narrowed its loss as a result of increased sales lower general and administrative costs and the absence of a 22 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2001 tempered by lower margins the casco automotive products unit posted a profit improvement in 2002 the primary reasons for the advance are the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization in 2002 improved sales at the foreign units and 

benefits gained from the 2001 restructuring program including improved cost controls and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes

operating income in the metal coating segment increased 51 in 2002 due primarily to the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization excluding these factors operating income at the unit advanced 5 as the benefit of improved profitability from ongoing six sigma initiatives and the 2001 restructuring program combined with lower natural gas prices to offset the impact of lower sales

the specialty chemicals segment posted improved results in 2002 driven by higher sales operating efficiencies generated from six sigma initiatives and costcontainment measures the absence of restructuring charges and goodwill amortization and the benefit of favorable currency movements approximately 08 million boosted results further the impacts of these factors were tempered by higher pension costs results of the specialty chemicals marketing units were ahead for the year primarily due to the june 2001 acquisition of a marketing unit

the other products segment posted an operating loss of 24 million in 2002 compared with an operating loss of 159 million in 2001 the improvement reflects three factors strong recovery at two of the three operating units in the segment decreased restructuring and related asset impairment charges and the absence of goodwill amortization partially offsetting these factors was a widening of the loss recorded by the megtec systems unit a 58 million swing excluding the impacts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization megtec systems results reflect the effect of the sharp decline in the worldwide graphic arts market mitigated by the inclusion of profits from a business acquired in september 2001 both years include substantial restructuring charges to curb costs in the tight market environment the can machinery unit posted a profit in the current year representing a favorable 131 million swing in operating results that was driven by several key factors improved absorption due to a higher level of production the absence of 2001 restructuring charges the benefits gained from the restructuring program and other costreduction efforts the ongoing six sigma program reduced provisions for slowmoving inventory and improved results at the specialty can systems operations after six posted a profit in 2002 and a loss in the prior year the improvement was driven by the benefits of operating efficiencies derived from the 2001 restructuring actions and also reflects reduced bad debt expense and an improved sales mix

a 19 increase in corporate expenses for 2002 reflects the addition of an accrual for incentive compensation an increase in pension expense and a restructuring charge to cover the costs of an early retirement program in 2002 partially offset by lower environmental cleanup provisions in 2002

interest expense

interest expense increased 04 million from 2001 due to a firstquarter increase in average borrowings as well as a higher firstquarter average interest rate the increased rate resulted from the repayment of lowerrate revolving credit debt using a portion of the proceeds of the 200 million 8 78 senior notes issued on april 2 2001

interest income

interest income decreased 17 million from 2001 primarily due to lower interest rates and the absence of earnings on a portion of the proceeds of the 200 million 8 78 senior notes issued on april 2 2001 that had been temporarily invested

equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures

sequa has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures which amounted to 425 million and 464 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures was losses of 01 million in 2002 and 07 million in 2001

chromalloy is a partner in joint ventures aimed at strengthening its ties to certain original equipment manufacturers and airline customers as well as ensuring close cooperation with respect to the dissemination of technical specifications and requirements sequas investment in chromalloys joint ventures was 406 million and 445 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the combination of income and losses of chromalloys joint ventures was income of 03 million in 2002 and 07 million in 2001

other net

in 2002 other net included 33 million of gain related to the change in the fair market value of a gas swap 28 million of income related to insurance litigation settlements concerning certain product liability claims relating to the closed operations of a predecessor company 09 million of gain on the fair market value of forward foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 06 million of gain on the sale of stock received from the demutualization of an issuer of corporateowned life insurance policies and pension annuities 15 million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs 13 million of discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable 10 million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees and 07 million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance

in 2001 other net included 46 million of income related to the demutualization of an issuer of corporateowned life insurance policies and pension annuities 43 million of gain on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary 41 million of discount expense related to the sale of accounts receivable 36 million of expense on the fair market valuation of a natural gas swap and related option 18 million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs 12 million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance and 10 million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees

income tax benefit

the 2002 income tax benefit of 96 million includes 41 million of tax benefit related to an increase in domestic net operating loss carryforwards due to the resolution of issues and the related completion of an internal revenue service audit and 24 million of income relating to the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required due to the completion of tax audits at two foreign units the effect of these items was to increase basic earnings per share by 040 and 023 respectively

tax settlement

in 2001 the internal revenue service notified sequa that a settlement agreement concerning the 1989 restructuring of two subsidiaries was approved as a result of the settlement 360 million representing the reversal of reserves no longer required was recorded as income through a reduction of the income tax provision the amount is separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations the impact of the settlement was to increase basic earnings per share by 347 in 2001

environmental matters

sequa has been notified that it has been named as a potentially responsible party under federal and state superfund laws andor has been named as a defendant in suits by private parties or governmental suits including private parties as codefendants with respect to sites currently or previously owned or operated by sequa or its predecessors or to which sequa or its predecessors may have sent hazardous wastes sequa is not presently aware of other such lawsuits or notices contemplated or planned by any private parties or environmental enforcement agencies the aggregate liability with respect to these matters net of liabilities already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet will not in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the financial position of sequa although adjustments to estimates based on improved knowledge of site conditions and chemical interactions with humans or changes in environmental law could have a significant impact on sequas results of operations in a particular period these environmental matters include the following

two propellant manufacturing facilities have soil and groundwater ammonium perchlorate ap contamination above the limit currently proposed by the us environmental protection agency for groundwater ap is a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel sequa has implemented a series of pilot tests to determine the feasibility and applicability of utilizing an emerging technology biodegration to treat apaffected soil and groundwater in the fourth quarter of 2001 sequa recorded an environmental charge that included 97 million of estimated costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ap

a number of claims have been filed in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in the vicinity of a predecessor corporation site which operated during the 1960s and early 1970s in dublin pennsylvania in october 1987 a class action was filed by residents of dublin against sequa and two other defendants the borough of dublin also filed suit seeking remediation of alleged contamination of the boroughs water supply and damages in an unspecified amount a settlement was reached in the class action in which sequa paid 18 million in 1997 the borough action was settled in 1998 when sequa agreed to transfer to the borough the water treatment system it constructed and 20 million was paid to the borough the pennsylvania department of environmental protection entered into a consent decree with sequa in 1990 providing for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study with respect to the same alleged groundwater contamination in dublin the us environmental protection agency placed the site on the superfund list in 1990 and in conjunction therewith entered into a consent agreement with sequa on december 31 1990 the negotiation for the final remedy is still in progress

the state of florida issued an administrative order in 1988 requiring turbocombustor technology inc tct a subsidiary of chromalloy to investigate and to take appropriate corrective action in connection with alleged groundwater contamination in stuart florida the contamination is alleged to have arisen from a 1985 fire which occurred at tcts former facility in stuart the city of stuart subsequently constructed and is operating a groundwater remediation system sequa negotiated a conditional settlement with the city of stuart in october 1994 whereby it would contribute its prorata share of the capital and operating costs for the groundwater treatment system on february 14 2000 the stuart city commission approved the execution of the settlement sequa estimates the amount to be paid in settlement plus additional groundwater sampling and analysis will be approximately 2 million to be paid over a tenyear period which began in the second quarter of 2000

in september 1993 14 homeowners residing in west nyack new york served a complaint on chromalloy and others alleging among other things that contamination from a former chromalloy site caused damage to the plaintiffs property all 14 homeowners agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in november 2002 the case was subsequently dismissed by the court chromalloy entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation dec on february 14 1994 to undertake the remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs relating to the alleged contamination in the vicinity of the former chromalloy site the dual phase extraction remedial system was started up in january 2003 it is scheduled to operate for five years

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in the fourth quarter of 2001 sequa recorded a charge of 133 million to increase its accruals for remediation costs the charge included 97 million of estimated cost to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap a raw material used in the manufacture of solid rocket propellant although no federal or state environmental standards have been finalized for ap recent studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function have prompted sequa to begin cleanup actions at its solid propellant facilities at december 31 2002 the potential exposure for all remediation costs is estimated to range from 16 million to 28 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 231 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 80 million in 2002 40 million in 2001 and 33 million in 2000 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 5 million and 8 million during 2003 and between 5 million and 7 million during 2004 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 13 million 24 million and 22 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 25 million during 2003 and 18 million during 2004 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were approximately 11 million in 2002 11 million in 2001 and 10 million in 2000 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 12 million per year during 2003 and 2004

employment

at december 31 2002 sequa employed approximately 10375 people of whom approximately 3500 were covered by union contracts

the approximate number of employees attributable to each reportable business segment as of december 31 2002 and 2001 was

segment

 

the increase in the number of employees in the propulsion segment primarily reflects an increase in hiring at the automotive reporting unit

in 2002 sequa continued its strategic restructuring program in response to difficult economic conditions prevailing in certain of its markets the restructuring program resulted in the termination of approximately 475 employees concentrated primarily in the aerospace segment and the megtec and after six units of the other products segment headcount reductions in the aerospace and other products segments were partially offset by the acquisitions of the remaining 50 interest in the pacific gas turbine joint venture and of a small brazilian machining operation

certain metal coating employees who were notified of their termination in 2001 continued their employment until the chicago illinois facility was closed in january 2002

sequa considers its relations with employees to be generally satisfactory sequa maintains a number of employee benefit programs including life medical and dental insurance pension and 401k plans

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

operating results 20022001

sales

overall sales declined 4 in 2002 driven primarily by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and at the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment the effect of these declines was tempered by advances in the propulsion and specialty chemicals segments a detailed review of sales for each segment follows

the 10 decline in sales in the aerospace segment was due primarily to the continuing downturn in the worldwide commercial aviation industry engine repair sales declined 11 13 excluding 81 million of sales of pacific gas turbine pgt a former equity affiliate which became whollyowned on september 30 2002 as an increase in sales to the us military and the benefit of translating foreign currency sales into us dollars approximately 48 million was more than offset by the poor conditions in the worldwide commercial airline industry the military sales advance was primarily driven by revenues from a contract to provide component repairs at kelly air force base sales of original equipment components declined 7 as increases in sales to the industrial turbine and us military markets and a favorable impact of approximately 26 million from translation of foreign currency results to us dollars was more than offset by the weak commercial aviation market persistent poor conditions in the airline industry continue to cloud the nearterm outlook for this unit given the outlook for this industry a recovery to more normal sales levels is not anticipated in the near future

sales of the propulsion segment increased 6 in 2002 sales of rocket motor propulsion systems were ahead 5 due to higher sales of liquid rocket motors for commercial space applications and the benefit of a 40 million technology transfer license payment excluding the license payment sales of propulsion systems were on a par with 2001 as new programs offset the absence of contributions from an advanced materials product line sold in may 2002 sales of automotive airbag inflators advanced 6 reflecting increased volumes and the benefit of translating foreign sales into us dollars approximately 23 million which more than offset an unfavorable shift to lower priced new products

sales of the metal coating segment declined 3 in 2002 with declines in building and manufactured products tempered by a modest advance in container products the year over year decline primarily reflects a 13 decline in the fourth quarter with sales in each of the three major market segments off from the prior year quarter sales to the building products market were down slightly in 2002 reflecting weakness in the preengineered sector of the commercial construction market partially offset by the impact of sales from a former equity affiliate midwest metal coatings which was consolidated in mid2001 modest advances in sales to the container market were driven by increased demand from the beverage industry while a small decline in sales to the manufactured products area primarily reflects weakness in transportation and lighting sectors management expects the building products market to remain soft in the first quarter of 2003

sales of the specialty chemicals segment advanced 12 in 2002 7 in local currency due to three principal factors stronger demand for the detergent additive taed sales added through the june 2001 acquisition of a specialty chemicals marketing unit and the favorable effect of the weakening of the us dollar on the translation of local currency results approximately 70 million

sales  contd

sales of the other products segment declined 6 in 2002 as advances at the automotive products and can machinery units were more than offset by declines at megtec systems and after six sales of megtec systems declined 15 24 excluding sales added by a september 2001 acquisition of the roll handling group the decline reflects the continuing weak condition of the worldwide graphic arts market management does not anticipate improvement in this market in 2003 sales of the can machinery unit registered a 6 advance in 2002 with increased sales of the can decorating and specialty can systems product lines more than offsetting lower sales of can forming equipment fourth quarter sales more than doubled compared to 2001 with all product lines contributing to the advance and the unit finished the year with a strong backlog position as a result management expects that sales in the upcoming quarters will compare favorably to the previous years comparable periods casco products sales increased 6 in 2002 due primarily to advances at the units foreign operations sales of the after six formalwear unit declined 11 in 2002 reflecting a drop in demand sales in the fourth quarter advanced 41 compared to an unusually low prior year quarter due to a post september 11 th downturn in 2001 backlog at this unit doubled compared to the prior year and management anticipates sales in the first quarter of 2003 will be higher than the first quarter of 2002

operating income

overall operating income increased 353 million or 136 in 2002 on an operating basis significant improvements at the propulsion and specialty chemicals segments and at three of the four units of the other products segment were partially offset by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment as well as increased expenses in the corporate segment other major factors in the advance were lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges 45 million in 2002 compared with 224 million in 2001 the cessation of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 142 131 million and lower environmental clean up provisions 02 million in 2002 compared with 133 million in 2001 the amounts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges recorded in 2002 and 2001 and the goodwill amortization in 2001 are summarized as follows

 

a detailed review of operating results by business segment follows

operating income  contd

operating income in the aerospace segment declined 32 in 2002 as the impact of continuing intense pressure on the commercial airline industry in 2002 was tempered by the absence of goodwill amortization lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges and the favorable effect of translating foreign currency results into us dollars approximately 07 million excluding these factors profits of the chromalloy gas turbine units primarily engaged in engine component repair were unfavorably affected by the following factors the decline in sales to the commercial aviation market increased inventory provisions primarily related to slow moving inventory startup costs related to a new unit offering repairs of auxiliary power units and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in 2001 these factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost reductions and restructuring actions as well as higher sales to the us military results of units primarily engaged in the manufacture of original equipment components were also negatively affected by lower volume an unfavorable sales mix shift and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in 2001 partially offset by a sharp reduction in operating expenses in light of the continuing difficulties and intense pricing pressures in the commercial airline market a return to the preseptember 11 2001 level of operating income is not expected in 2003 furthermore a prolonged decline in the level of air travel will continue to have an adverse impact on chromalloy

operating income in the propulsion segment was 78 million in 2002 whereas the segment recorded a loss of 210 million in 2001 the 2001 loss included a 102 million environmental cleanup provision primarily to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate 57 million of goodwill amortization and asset impairment charges of 32 million 22 million at the domestic airbag inflator operation and 10 million at the propulsion operation excluding the impact of these three items the segments 2001 loss was 19 million for a 97 million swing in yearoveryear results both the propulsion and airbag inflator product lines contributed to the improvement the propulsion systems profit advance was primarily driven by profits from the technology transfer license the automotive airbag inflator product line narrowed its loss as a result of increased sales and lower general and administrative costs tempered by lower margins

operating income in the metal coating segment increased 51 in 2002 due primarily to the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization excluding these factors operating income at the unit advanced 5 as the benefit of improved profitability from ongoing six sigma initiatives and the 2001 restructuring program combined with lower natural gas prices to offset the impact of lower sales natural gas prices have increased significantly in early 2003 and continuation of the current price levels will have an adverse impact on precoat metals operating income in later quarters

the specialty chemicals segment posted improved results in 2002 driven by higher sales operating efficiencies generated from six sigma initiatives and cost containment measures the absence of restructuring charges and goodwill amortization and the benefit of favorable currency movements approximately 08 million boosted results further the impacts of these factors were tempered by higher pension costs results of the specialty chemicals marketing units were ahead for the year primarily due to the june 2001 acquisition of a marketing unit on an overall basis profits of this segment for the first quarter of 2003 are expected to continue to trend higher as a result of continuing strong demand from the international detergent market and favorable currency conditions

operating income  contd

the other products segment posted operating profit of 19 million in 2002 this segment recorded an operating loss of 197 million in 2001 the improvement reflects three factors strong recovery at three of the four operating units in the segment decreased restructuring and related asset impairment charges and the absence of goodwill amortization partially offsetting these factors was a widening of the loss recorded by the megtec systems unit a 58 million swing excluding the impacts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization megtecs results reflect the effect of the sharp decline in the worldwide graphic arts market mitigated by the inclusion of profits from a business acquired in september 2001 both years include substantial restructuring charges to curb costs in the tight market environment a further restructuring charge estimated at 15 million will result from a plan to streamline its european operations which will be completed in 2003 the can machinery unit posted a profit in the current year representing a favorable 131 million swing in operating results that was driven by several key factors improved absorption due to a higher level of production the absence of 2001 restructuring charges the benefits gained from the restructuring program and other cost reduction efforts the ongoing six sigma program reduced provisions for slow moving inventory and improved results at the specialty can systems operations the casco automotive products unit posted a profit improvement in 2002 the primary reasons for the advance are the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization in 2002 improved sales at the foreign units and benefits gained from the 2001 restructuring program including improved cost controls and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes in order to further reduce costs management announced plans in early 2003 to transfer production from its plant in bridgeport connecticut to other facilities management anticipates that the move will be completed by mid2003 at an estimated cost of approximately 15 million which includes costs for severance and relocation after six posted a profit in 2002 and a loss in the prior year the improvement was driven by the benefits of operating efficiencies derived from the 2001 restructuring actions and also reflects reduced bad debt expense and an improved sales mix

a 19 increase in corporate expenses for 2002 reflects the addition of an accrual for incentive compensation an increase in pension expense and a restructuring charge to cover the costs of an early retirement program in 2002 partially offset by lower environmental cleanup provisions in 2002

pension expense

operating income for 2002 includes 133 million of expense related to the periodic net pension cost of all of sequas significant domestic and foreign funded defined benefit plans on an annual basis sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans in order to reflect current market conditions at december 31 2002 the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was changed from 90 to 83 and the discount rate used to value pension obligations was changed from 75 to 675 as a result of these changes and the effect of a decline in the investment performance of its pension portfolios in 2002 management currently anticipates that pension expense in 2003 for these plans will double to approximately 27 million with the largest dollar increases affecting the aerospace propulsion specialty chemicals and corporate segments

 

interest expense

interest expense increased 04 million from 2001 due to a firstquarter increase in average borrowings as well as a higher firstquarter average interest rate the increased rate resulted from the repayment of lowerrate revolving credit debt using a portion of the proceeds of the 200 million 8 78 senior notes issued on april 2 2001

interest income

interest income decreased 17 million from 2001 primarily due to lower interest rates and the absence of earnings on a portion of the proceeds of the 200 million 8 78 senior notes issued on april 2 2001 that had been temporarily invested

equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures

sequa has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures which amounted to 425 million and 464 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures was losses of 01 million in 2002 and 07 million in 2001

chromalloy is a partner in joint ventures aimed at strengthening its ties to certain original equipment manufacturers and airline customers as well as ensuring close cooperation with respect to the dissemination of technical specifications and requirements sequas investment in chromalloys joint ventures was 406 million and 445 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the combination of income and losses of chromalloys joint ventures was income of 03 million in 2002 and 07 million in 2001 the largest of the chromalloy joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs

in december 2002 chromalloy signed an agreement with siemens westinghouse power corporation and siemens aktiengesellschaft collectively referred to as siemens to establish a global cooperation consisting of joint ownership of certain operating companies these operating companies will provide service and repairs for heavy industrial gas turbines manufactured by other companies or for gas turbines based on the mature technologies of siemens and its affiliates the agreement has been approved by the european commission which reviews mergers acquisitions and joint ventures and it is anticipated that the agreement will be effective in the second quarter of 2003 chromalloy has a 49 ownership interest in turbine airfoil coating  repair llc tacr an existing joint venture with siemens tacr coats new parts and repairs components of industrial gas turbines primarily for siemens

chromalloy has a 49 ownership interest in masaood john brown ltd mjb a partnership with mohammed bin masaood  sons which provides repair and maintenance services for industrial gas turbines from a facility in the united arab emirates at december 31 2002 sequa has guaranteed mjbs bank line of credit in the amount of 70 million

chromalloy has a 526 ownership interest which does not equate to a controlling interest in a component manufacturing operation that produces new replacement parts for jet engines while chromalloys partners in this joint venture are major commercial airlines whose industry has been under significant pressures management believes that the venture is adequately capitalized

equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures  contd

chromalloy has two 5050 joint ventures with rollsroyce plc turbine surface technologies ltd tst which will provide advanced coatings for rollsroyce turbine components and turbine repair technologies ltd trt which provides advanced component repair services for certain rollsroyce engines tst is expected to generate sales in 2003

advanced coatings technologies act a 50 owned joint venture with united technologies corporation owns and operates an electron beam ceramic coater for the application of pratt  whitney coatings to jet engine parts

on september 30 2002 chromalloy acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in pacific gas turbine center llc pgt which overhauls and tests certain jet engines the acquired assets and liabilities of pgt and the results of operations have been consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date

the 2002 income tax benefit of 41 million includes 41 million of tax benefit related to an increase in domestic net operating loss carryforwards due to the resolution of issues and the related completion of an internal revenue service audit and 24 million of income relating to the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required due to the completion of tax audits at two foreign units the effect of these items is to increase basic earnings per share by 040 and 023 respectively

tax settlement

in 2001 the irs notified sequa that a settlement agreement concerning the 1989 restructuring of two subsidiaries was approved as a result of the settlement 360 million representing the reversal of reserves no longer required was recorded as income through a reduction of the income tax provision the amount is separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations the impact of the settlement was to increase basic earnings per share by 347 in 2001

effect of a change in accounting principle

on january 1 2002 sequa adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 the statement changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach

sequa completed the transitional impairment review required under sfas no 142 and recorded a noncash charge of 1148 million net of a related tax benefit on deductible goodwill of 80 million as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations the fair values of sequas reporting units were measured using an income approach based on a present value technique of estimated expected future cash flows the transitional charge relates to the missile and space propulsion 1018 million and automotive inflator 31 million reporting units of the propulsion segment and the megtec systems 91 million and after six 08 million reporting units of the other products segment the effect of the change in accounting principle reduced basic earnings per share by 1102 for the year ended december 31 2002 further information regarding the impact of this statement is contained in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

pursuant to sfas no 142 goodwill is to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis the review date may coincide with the anniversary of the implementation date january 1 or another date may be selected sequa has selected october 1 as the date for subsequent reviews sequa reviewed its goodwill as of october 1 2002 and determined that no further impairment of goodwill had occurred

loss from discontinued operations

sequas investment in discontinued operations primarily relates to a leveraged lease portfolio that will be liquidated over the next 12 years as rentals are received and residual values are realized the leveraged lease cash flow stream excluding estimated residual values services the payment of principal and interest on a nonrecourse loan that securitized the lease portfolio

sequas investment in the leveraged lease portfolio is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the continuing creditworthiness of the various lessees certain of the leases concern aircraft leased to major commercial airlines including one with united airlines ual in december 2002 ual filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code chapter 11 in december 2002 sequa recorded an 110 million aftertax charge of which 63 million relates to the writeoff of the net investment in the ual lease the balance of the aftertax charge relates to a permanent decline in the realizability of remaining aircraft residual values the effect of the aftertax charge from discontinued operations reduced basic earnings per share by 105

riskconcentration of business

sequas largest operation chromalloy gas turbine corporation with 2002 sales and operating income of 6752 million and 453 million respectively and total assets at december 31 2002 of 8062 million has experienced significant difficulties in its operating environment since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 which had a severe immediate and extended impact on the airline industry compounded by a general economic slowdown the downturn in air travel has had a significant impact on both chromalloys repair and original equipment component manufacturing operations which derived approximately 80 of their 2002 sales from the commercial aviation market the large repair business is directly related to the number of hours jet engines are flown and the original equipment component manufacturing business is related to the number of new jet engines placed in service the economic impact on chromalloy has been partially offset by cost cutting measures in light of the continuing difficulties and intense pricing pressures in the commercial airline market a return to the preseptember 11 2001 level of operating income is not expected in 2003 furthermore a prolonged decline in the level of air travel will continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of chromalloy and on its joint ventures 111 million investment at december 31 2002 that serve the airline industry

in march 2003 standard  poors ratings services sp placed its ratings on 12 airlines on creditwatch with negative implications sp cited the looming war with iraq and its estimation that already weak airlines will incur substantial losses and cash outflow due to declines in air travel

at february 28 2003 trade receivables due from major commercial airlines totaled approximately 43 million the poor business conditions in the airline industry and the possibility of bankruptcy filings by other carriers who are customers of chromalloy could adversely affect the ability of chromalloy to realize some of these receivables

ual which filed chapter 11 in december 2002 accounted for approximately 25 million or 4 of chromalloys sales in 2002 5 of 2001 sales the prepetition net trade accounts receivable balance is nominal the impact of the ual filing on chromalloys operations is uncertain at this time

chromalloy competes for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies including the oems the oems generally have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components chromalloy has a number of such approvals including licensing agreements which allow it to repair certain components of flight engines the loss of a major oems approval to repair components for its engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy although management believes it has certain actions available to it to mitigate this effect

sequa is engaged in the automotive airbag inflator business through arc arcs largest customer for airbag inflators is breed and its subsidiaries which are supplied under longterm contracts breed and its subsidiaries accounted for 761 million or 25 of arcs sales in 2002 and 955 million or 33 of sales in 2001

riskconcentration of business  contd

precoat metals markets its coating services to steel and aluminum producers and distributors building products manufacturers merchant can makers and manufacturers of other diverse products the steel manufacturers have experienced difficult economic pressures and the industry is undergoing a period of consolidation precoat metals has worked to insulate its accounts receivable exposure furthermore precoat metals primarily acts as a toll coater for its steel mill customers and therefore does not own significant stores of coil inventory to serve this market

on march 6 2002 national steel filed chapter 11 national steel is precoat metals largest customer accounting for approximately 82 million or 35 of 2002 sales 37 of 2001 sales the prepetition trade receivable balance with national steel was nominal and precoat metals operations have not been adversely impacted ak steel has been granted stalking horse rights by the bankruptcy court for the purchase of national steels assets contingent on ak steel reaching a new labor agreement with the united steel workers of america us steel has also indicated its interest in acquiring national steels assets should ak steel be unsuccessful in its negotiations

sequas investment in discontinued operations primarily relates to a leveraged lease portfolio that is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the creditworthiness of the lessees several of the leases are for aircraft leased to major commercial airlines including one with ual in december 2002 sequa recorded an 110 million aftertax charge related to its investment in the ual lease as well as a permanent reduction in other aircraft residuals in february 2003 american airlines inc aa issued a term sheet to parties involved in its leveraged lease financings as part of a process to implement a consensual restructuring of its obligations to its stakeholders the term sheet outlines net present value savings that aa is seeking as part of its restructuring management does not believe that the aa term sheet is indicative of the value the leveraged lease arrangement provides to aa and it is premature to estimate the impact on sequas investment in discontinued operations of a potential bankruptcy by aa at december 31 2002 sequas remaining investment in aircraft leases with major commercial airlines is 397 million of which 162 million relates to aa

derivative and other financial instruments

sequa is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and from changes in the prices of certain commodities which impact its earnings cash flows and financial condition sequa manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financial activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments sequa has established a control environment which assigns senior executives and in certain instances operational management responsibility for risk assessment and the approval reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities sequa does not buy hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes sequas primary foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound and to the euro to mitigate the shortterm effect of changes in currency exchange rates sequa utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and derivatives thereof to manage its exposure to certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge firm commitments and forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the 

derivative and other financial instruments  contd

functional currency depending on the volatility of the market sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of its natural gas requirements to fixed rates depending on the use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an efficient hedge gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of shareholders equity

a hypothetical 10 uniform decrease in all foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have decreased the fair value of sequas financial instruments by approximately 119 million as of december 31 2002 and 106 million as of december 31 2001 the sensitivity analysis relates only to sequas exchange ratesensitive financial instruments which include cash and debt amounts denominated in foreign currencies and all open foreign forward exchange contracts at december 31 2002 and 2001 the effect of this hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on the value of net assets other than financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and does not consider the effect this movement may have on anticipated foreign currency cash flows

at december 31 2002 and 2001 substantially all of sequas debt was at fixed rates and sequa currently does not hold interest rate derivative contracts accordingly a change in market interest rates would not materially impact sequas interest expense but would affect the fair value of sequas debt generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise the estimated fair value of sequas total debt was approximately 672 million at december 31 2002 and 660 million at december 31 2001 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 296 million at december 31 2002 and 321 million at december 31 2001 a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of sequas total debt by approximately 314 million at december 31 2002 and 343 million at december 31 2001 the fair value of sequas total debt is based primarily upon quoted market prices of sequas publicly traded securities the estimated changes in the fair values of sequas debt are based upon changes in the present value of future cash flows as derived from the hypothetical changes in market interest rates

environmental matters

sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites

environmental matters  contd

it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in the fourth quarter of 2001 sequa recorded a charge of 133 million to increase its accruals for remediation costs the charge included 97 million of estimated cost to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel although no federal or state environmental standards have been finalized for ap recent studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function have prompted sequa to begin cleanup actions at its solid propellant facilities at december 31 2002 the potential exposure for all remediation costs is estimated to range from 16 million to 28 million and sequas consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of 231 million these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

with respect to all known environmental liabilities sequas actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were 80 million in 2002 40 million in 2001 and 33 million in 2000 sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between 5 million and 8 million during 2003 and between 5 million and 7 million during 2004 sequas capital expenditures for projects to eliminate control or dispose of pollutants were 13 million 24 million and 22 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively sequa anticipates annual environmentrelated capital expenditures to be approximately 25 million during 2003 and 18 million during 2004 sequas operating expenses to eliminate control and dispose of pollutants were approximately 11 million in 2002 11 million in 2001 and 10 million in 2000 sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately 12 million per year during 2003 and 2004

backlog

the businesses of sequa for which backlogs are significant are the turbine airfoils turbocombustor technology and castings units of the aerospace segment the solid and liquid rocket motor operations of the propulsion segment and the sequa can machinery megtec and after six units of the other products segment the aggregate dollar amount of backlog in these units was 2542 million at december 31 2002 and 2124 million at december 31 2001 increases in backlog at the propulsion segment sequa can machinery and after six were partially offset by a decline at megtec sales of after six are seasonal with stronger sales in the first six months of the year accordingly this units backlog is normally higher at december 31 than at any other time of the year

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities was 799 million in 2002 compared with 881 million in 2001 higher operating income levels and a decrease in taxes paid which included a federal tax refund received in 2002 were more than offset by increased working capital requirements primarily related to pension contributions cash used for investing activities was 871 million 

liquidity and capital resources  contd

in 2002 compared with 578 million in 2001 the 293 million increased usage primarily relates to the proceeds on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary in 2001 net cash from financing activities was 85 million in 2002 compared with 520 million in 2001 the 436 million decrease reflects the 1968 million net proceeds from the april 2001 debt offering and subsequent repayment in 2001 of amounts outstanding under sequas mediumterm note issue revolving credit and receivables purchase agreements as well as an increase in receivables sold in 2002 net cash provided by the effect of exchange rate changes was 105 million in 2002 compared with 52 million used in 2001 the 157 million increase primarily reflects the strengthening of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar in 2002 from 2001 and a modest weakening of these same currencies relative to the us dollar in 2001 from 2000

in january 2002 sequa cancelled its 75 million revolving credit agreement adverse economic conditions precluded sequa from being in compliance with certain financial covenants of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the facility was not used during that period sequa has held intermittent discussions with a group of banks regarding a new secured credit facility however given the sufficient level of liquidity management has chosen not to enter into a new agreement at this time

in the third quarter of 2002 fitch ratings downgraded the senior unsecured debt of sequa to bb from bb and revised its rating outlook to negative from stable fitch ratings cited sequas weakened financial performance over the previous 18 months the cyclical nature of each of sequas businesses particularly commercial aerospace and the underfunded status of sequas defined benefit pension plans in the second quarter of 2002 standard  poors lowered its longterm corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on sequa to bb from bb

in march 2003 sp placed its ratings on 14 commercial aviation suppliers including sequa on creditwatch with negative implications sp cited the looming war with iraq as likely to have a significant impact on commercial aviation which in turn would put additonal pressures on companies serving that industry

the absence of a revolving credit agreement and the downgrade in debt ratings have impacted sequas ability to issue new unsecured letters of credit and surety bonds for financial guarantees while sequas letters of credit generally renew on an annual evergreen basis it is possible that some issuers may require collateral in the future in december 2002 sequa deposited 84 million with an insurance carrier when the surety market for financial guarantees became extremely tight and sequa was unable to renew a surety bond the amount is being held in an interest bearing account as cash collateral against future expected claims and is refundable upon the issuance of a letter of credit

at december 31 2002 sequa was contingently liable for 313 million of outstanding letters of credit and 46 million of surety bonds not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in addition sequa has guaranteed a 70 million bank line of credit for its mjb joint venture sequa is not currently aware of any existing conditions that would cause risk of loss relative to the outstanding letters of credit surety bonds or the guarantee

liquidity and capital resources  contd

sequa receivables corp src a wholly owned special purpose corporation has a receivables purchase agreement extending through november 2003 under which it may sell up to 120 million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in sequas eligible trade receivables through a bank sponsored facility under the terms of the agreement srcs assets will be available to satisfy its obligations to its creditors which have security interests in certain of srcs assets prior to any distribution to sequa management has held preliminary discussions regarding a renewal of the facility and expects that an agreement will be in place similar in terms and in an amount commensurate with underlying receivables balances upon the expiration of the current receivables purchase agreement alternatively subject to liquidity requirements a new secured bank credit facility may replace the receivables purchase agreement and provide for additional funds including the issuance of letters of credit in accordance with sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 125 transactions under the receivables purchase agreement qualify as a sale of receivables trade receivables included in the december 31 2002 consolidated balance sheet are net of 800 million of receivables sold under the agreement

capital expenditures amounted to 736 million in 2002 with spending concentrated in the aerospace propulsion and metal coating segments these funds were primarily used to upgrade existing facilities and equipment and to expand airbag inflator capacity sequa currently anticipates that capital spending in 2003 will be approximately 85 million and will be concentrated in the aerospace and propulsion segments

in 2002 sequa contributed 219 million to its domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans due to the present underfunded status of these plans management anticipates that additional pension contributions will total approximately 27 million in the next 12 months and will be contributed primarily in the third quarter of 2003

due to 2002 declines in the equity markets as well as lower interest rates utilized to value yearend pension liabilities sequa recorded a 651 million aftertax fourthquarter charge through other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity to increase pension liabilities to required levels in the consolidated balance sheet

in october 2002 sequa purchased and cancelled 20 million of its 9 senior notes due in 2009 management regarded the purchase to be at a satisfactory price although sequa has no formal plan to purchase its outstanding notes or other securities management may depending on market conditions and other factors from time to time purchase its notes or other securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions

management currently anticipates that cash flow from operations the 260 million available at march 20 2003 under the receivables purchase agreement and the agreements expected fourth quarter renewal in an amount commensurate with underlying receivable balances or alternatively subject to liquidity requirements a new secured bank credit facility that may replace the receivables purchase agreement and provide for additional funds including the issuance of letters of credit and the 1017 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at february 28 2003 will be sufficient to fund sequas operations for 2003 including the 626 million of interest payments due on the outstanding 9 and 8 78 senior notes 85 million of estimated capital expenditures the 27 million of estimated pension contributions and any future requirements of collateral on letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled 354 million at february 28 2003

significant accounting policies and estimates

sequa believes that the application of the following accounting policies is important to its financial position and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of sequas significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included on pages 44 through 48 of this annual report on form 10k

allowance for doubtful accounts

certain of sequas operating segments provide services to industries that are or have been experiencing difficult economic pressures the aerospace segment performs repair and other services for the commercial airline industry and the metal coating segment counts major steel mills among its customers see the riskconcentration of business section of this mda on pages 22 and 23 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion many of sequas customers are large wellknown companies and the customer base is monitored through a review of account balance agings an assessment of customer financial condition and interactions with the customers reserves are established through a combination of specific identification of problem accounts and percentages of aging brackets

inventory reserves

the aerospace segment chromalloy gas turbine maintains significant inventories of parts to serve the repair market in order to ensure that any obsolete or slow moving inventory is properly identified and valued chromalloy has in place a policy that mandates minimum reserve requirements based on usage the policy provides for a consistent and systematic approach to valuing inventory with reserves reassessed quarterly and at yearend for adequacy management believes that while demand for certain repair services and manufactured parts has been volatile during the past year and can remain volatile while the industry is disrupted the longterm outlook for the industry is positive however a further decline in air travel would have an adverse impact on inventory reserve requirements

revenue recognition

the propulsion segment is engaged in the military contract market to produce propulsion systems primarily for tactical weapons longterm contracts are accounted for on the percentageofcompletion method whereby sales are primarily recognized based upon costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total costs and gross profits are recognized under a more conservative effortsexpended method primarily based upon direct labor costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total direct labor costs changes in estimates for sales costs and gross profit are recognized in the period in which they are determinable using the cumulative catchup method

goodwill

sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis sequa recorded a 1148 million aftertax transitional impairment charge effective with the january 1 2002 adoption of sfas no 142 sequa updated its review of goodwill on its selected annual test date of october 1 2002 and noted no further impairment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit if these 

goodwill  contd

estimates and assumptions change in the future due to such factors as a decline in general economic conditions a longterm or permanent decline in air travel competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements controls an impairment charge may be required details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on page 75 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference

income taxes

sequa has significant domestic net operating loss carryforwards as well as deferred tax assets established through other comprehensive income in recording a minimum required pension liability management believes that such carryforwards and deferred tax assets will be utilized before their expiration through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future earnings and available tax planning strategies sequas ability to generate the expected amounts of domestic taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions the state of the airline industry and other major markets competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond managements control there can be no assurance that sequa will meet its expectations for future domestic taxable income in the carryforward period or that available tax strategies can be enacted however management has considered the above factors in reaching the conclusion that it is more likely than not that future domestic taxable income and available tax strategies will be sufficient to fully realize the domestic operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets at december 31 2002

environmental sequas environmental department under senior managements direction manages all activities related to sequas involvement in environmental cleanup this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws these projected expenditures which are reviewed periodically include remedial investigation and feasibility studies outside legal consulting and remediation project management fees the projected cost of remediation activities and site closure and postremediation monitoring costs the assessments take into account currently available facts existing technology presently enacted laws past expenditures and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement outside technical scientific and legal consulting services are used to support managements assessments of costs at significant individual sites it is sequas policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures

operating results 20012000

sales

overall sales of 18 billion for 2001 were virtually unchanged from 2000 advances at the propulsion and metal coating segments were offset by slight declines in the aerospace and specialty chemicals segments and by a sharper decline in the other products segment a detailed review of sales for each segment follows

sales of the aerospace segment declined 2 in 2001 on a pro forma basis  to exclude the prior years sales from operations contributed to joint ventures during 2000 and the sales of caval tool which was divested on february 28 2001  aerospace sales advanced 5 engine component repair sales advanced 5 in 2001 despite the absence of sales from units contributed to joint ventures 145 million and the unfavorable effect of translating foreign sales to us dollars approximately 26 million the advance in the repair segment reflects higher sales to the commercial airline market and the industrial gas turbine market in the fourth quarter of 2001 sales to the repair market declined 5 primarily due to the impact on the commercial airlines of the september 11 terrorist attacks the impact on sales was partially offset by work already in house sales to the original equipment market declined 17 in 2001 a reflection of the divestiture of caval tool 272 million impact weak market conditions and the unfavorable effect of translating foreign sales to us dollars approximately 34 million

sales of the propulsion segment increased 5 in 2001 as sales of automotive airbag inflators rose 10 due to the february 1 2001 acquisition by an arc affiliate of certain assets and the automotive inflator business of bag spa an italian operation that was previously 50 owned by arc domestic automotive inflator sales declined 16 because of the absence of sales to bag spa in the last 11 months of 2001 propulsion sales were on a par with 2000

sales of the metal coating segment increased 6 in 2001 primarily driven by a strong advance in sales to the building products market and the consolidation of a former equity affiliate midwest metal coatings mmc for the last seven months of 2001 the increase in building products primarily reflects market share gains and strong demand from the component segment of the market sales to the container market registered a small advance as the benefit derived from the temporary shutdown of coating capacity at a customers facility more than offset general weakness in the container market sales to the manufactured products market were on a par with the prior year the fourth quarter was particularly strong for the metal coating segment with double digit increases in sales to each of the major markets served

sales of the specialty chemicals segment declined 1 in 2001 as a 4 increase in local currency sales was more than offset by the translation of local currency amounts to us dollars the local currency increase was due entirely to the addition of two specialty chemicals marketing units acquired in 2001 and 2000 sales of detergent chemicals declined 3 for the year though a rebound in fourthquarter demand tempered the impact of midyear market weakness the marketing units were unfavorably affected by the weak euro and a softening in demand which began in the second quarter

sales  contd

sales of the other products segment declined 9 in 2001 with each of the major units down from the preceding year sales of megtec systems declined 3 8 excluding sales from the recently acquired roll handling group with lower sales to all major markets graphic arts emission controls and industrial products fourthquarter sales declined 21 34 excluding the impact of the roll handling group reflecting both very weak market conditions and the effect of comparison against a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2000 backlog at yearend was down 32 from yearend 2000 primarily reflecting weakness in demand from the graphic arts market sales of sequa can machinery declined 6 in 2001 with lower sales to the can forming and decorating equipment and spare parts markets tempered by a 7 increase in specialty can systems sales at automotive supplier casco products declined 12 due primarily to a significant decline in sales to the north american market foreign units registered a small advance as local currency increases were tempered by the impact of the stronger dollar on translation of the results 15 million sales of the mens apparel unit after six declined 33 for the year and 53 for the fourth quarter due to a sharp decline in demand for formalwear backlog at this unit was down 45 from yearend 2000

operating income

overall operating income declined 773 million or 75 in 2001 the major elements in the decline were restructuring and related asset impairment charges of 224 million 192 million higher than in 2000 a 133 million provision for environmental cleanup 123 million higher than in 2000 and an unfavorable swing in results exclusive of the restructuring and environmental provisions of 209 million in the propulsion segment and 277 million in the other products segment a detailed review of operating results for each segment follows

operating income in the aerospace segment declined 3 in 2001 results for 2001 include a restructuring charge of 40 million and related asset impairment charges of 04 million these costs were for a 376 person approximately 6 reduction in chromalloy gas turbines workforce and the closing of a small facility on a pro forma basis to exclude these charges operating income increased 4 in 2001 the segment benefited from the absence of product development costs 30 million in the first six months of 2000 at a component manufacturing unit now treated as an equity investment and improved profitability at units engaged primarily in oem activities these benefits were tempered by lower profits at units primarily engaged in component repair for both the commercial airlines and industrial gas turbine aftermarkets while declines at these repair units in the first nine months were due entirely to the absence of approximately 30 million of operating income from business transferred to joint ventures in 2000 the fourthquarter decline reflected the dislocations in the commercial airline market following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks partially offset by costcutting actions and the resolution of certain contractual matters and cost estimates which allowed previously established reserves of 13 million to be reversed

the propulsion segment reported a 210 million loss in 2001 compared with a 100 million profit in 2000 the unfavorable swing primarily reflects losses at the automotive airbag inflator operations a fourthquarter environmental cleanup provision of 102 million 32 million in asset impairment charges and a decline in profits in the rocket motor propulsion unit losses at

operating income  contd

the automotive airbag inflator operations primarily reflect three major factors the consolidation of the italian inflator operation beginning february 1 2001 an unfavorable shift in the mix of domestic airbag inflator sales and a 22 million asset impairment charge the 102 million provision for environmental cleanup was primarily related to the establishment of a 97 million reserve to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap a raw material used in the production of solid rocket motor propellant although no federal or applicable state environmental standards have been finalized for ap studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function prompted the unit to begin cleanup actions at its two affected solid propellant facilities excluding the environmental provision the decline in operating profit in the rocket propulsion portion of the business is primarily related to a 10 million asset impairment charge and to lower margins in the liquid propulsion market primarily caused by cost overruns on a commercial satellite program in the second half of 2001

operating income in the metal coating segment declined 29 or 55 million in 2001 the decline was due entirely to 57 million of restructuring and related asset impairment charges to cover an early retirement program and the closing of a coating facility in chicago illinois excluding these charges results for 2001 were on a par with 2000 as strong operating results in the second half of the year offset the effect of a poor first quarter on an operating basis a 6 increase in sales 4 without the impact of mmc the earnings added by the newly acquired mmc unit improved productivity and income from a consulting agreement were offset by higher natural gas pricing approximately 28 million and by weakness in the secondary metal market

operating income in the specialty chemicals segment declined 17 in 2001 both years were affected by restructuring charges related to early retirement programs 11 million in 2001 and 32 million in 2000 the decline was primarily due to lower profits at the marketing units where the benefits of higher sales were largely offset by currencydriven margin pressures and weakness in a key product market increased pension expense and the impact of a declining pound sterling on reported us dollar results at the larger detergent chemicals operation the benefits of restructuring and other ongoing cost containment initiatives were largely offset by slightly lower sales and higher raw material costs the impact on operating income of restructuring charges net of sameyear savings was roughly equivalent in both years

the other products segment posted a 197 million loss in 2001 whereas this segment had operating income of 192 million in 2000 each of the four operating units recorded losses in 2001 whereas each recorded profits in 2000 of the 389 million swing in operating results 112 million reflects restructuring actions taken at the four units megtec had an unfavorable 78 million swing in operating results which included a 32 million restructuring charge to reduce the work force by 5 without this charge the unit was at approximately breakeven in 2001 due to the impact of a sharp decline in sales in the fourth quarter and a shift to lower margined products the sequa can machinery operation registered an unfavorable swing of 120 million in operating results this was primarily attributable to restructuring and related asset impairment charges of 26 million for headcount reductions and the closing of a facility the impact of lower sales and a significantly lower level of manufacturing activity in can forming and decorating products on absorption and gross profit increased provisions for slow moving inventory and lower spare parts sales casco the automotive products unit recorded an 117

million unfavorable swing in operating results in 2001 this included a restructuring charge of 36 million and related asset impairment charges of 11 million to cover the impact of headcount reductions and the writedown of equipment used in processes being outsourced the balance of the decline is attributable to a loss at the domestic operation where sales declined sharply and pressure on costs and margins continued results at after six the mens apparel unit were down 73 million primarily due to a 33 drop in sales manufacturing inefficiencies and increased inventory markdowns and bad debt provisions restructuring and related asset impairment charges totaled 07 million for this unit which resulted from the decision to manufacture a large portion of the units products offshore

corporate expenses declined 9 in 2001 primarily a reflection of the absence of a bonus accrual partially offset by increased environmental cleanup provisions for operations that are no longer part of sequa 31 million in 2001 10 million in 2000 and higher pension costs

interest expense

interest expense increased 69 million from 2000 and reflects a higher level of average borrowings due to expanded working capital needs at sequas chromalloy unit resulting from growth initiatives pursued in 2000 as well as other general corporate purposes the increase also reflects a higher average interest rate resulting from the repayment of revolving credit debt using a portion of the proceeds of the 200 million 8 78 senior notes

equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures

sequas investments in unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to 464 million and 657 million at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures resulted in net equity losses of 07 million in 2001 and 20 million in 2000 the largest of these joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs

on february 1 2001 arc through an affiliate acquired certain assets and the ongoing automotive airbag inflator business of bag spa pursuant to an overall settlement agreement with its former joint venture partner breed technologies inc the results of operations as they relate to the acquired assets and the ongoing inflator business of bag spa have been fully consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date sequa continues to have an equity investment in bag spa reflecting underlying assets established for certain anticipated liabilities as the venture is wound down sequas investment in bag spa was 19 million at december 31 2001 and 152 million at december 31 2000 sequas equity share of the losses of the bag spa joint venture was 19 million in 2001 and 20 million in 2000 the 2001 loss includes a 12 million writedown of an airbag inflator production line

chromalloy has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures which amounted to 445 million and 415 million at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures resulted in net equity income of 07 million in 2001 and net equity losses of 02 million in 2000

in june 2001 precoat metals acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in midwest metal coatings mmc which coats coils of heavy gauge steel for structural components used in the building products market the results of operations have been fully consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date sequas investment in mmc was 90 million at december 31 2000 sequas equity share of net income from mmc was 05 million in 2001 and 03 million in 2000

other net

in 2001 other net included 46 million of income related to the demutualization of an issuer of corporateowned life insurance policies and pension annuities 43 million of gain on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary 41 million of discount expense related to the sale of accounts receivable 36 million of expense on the fair market valuation of a natural gas swap and related option 18 million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs 12 million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance and 10 million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities was 881 million in 2001 compared with 423 million in 2000 the primary reasons for the 458 million increase were a lower level of working capital requirements partly offset by lower operating income and an increase in taxes paid that primarily reflects the absence of a federal tax refund received in 2000 cash used for investing activities was 578 million in 2001 compared with 1158 million in 2000 the 580 million decrease primarily relates to the proceeds on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary and a lower level of capital spending in 2001 net cash from financing activities was 520 million in 2001 compared with 624 million in 2000 the 104 million decrease reflects the 1968 million net proceeds from the april 2001 debt offering and the subsequent repayment of the 664 million 101 mediumterm notes due in midmay and amounts outstanding under sequas revolving credit and receivables purchase agreements

on april 2 2001 sequa completed an offering of 200 million of 8 78 senior notes due april 1 2008 through a private placement under rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act net proceeds received on april 2 2001 from the 8 78 senior notes offering amounted to 1968 million the proceeds were used to repay approximately 100 million outstanding under sequas revolving credit agreement to redeem 664 million of 101 mediumterm notes when they matured in midmay 2001 and for general corporate purposes including a reduction in the amount outstanding under the receivables purchase agreement concurrent with the completion of the 8 78 senior notes offering sequas revolving credit facility was reduced to 75 million from 150 million

54 billion in revenue in fiscal 2001 61 billion in revenue in fiscal 2000 and 41 billion in revenue in fiscal 1999 markets   the market for our test and measurement products comprises three major customer groups  

 

   network equipment manufacturers provide products to facilitate the transmission of voice and data traffic this transmission may be in various forms such as electronic signals over copper wire optical signals over fiber cables and radio frequency or microwave signals the customers of the network equipment manufacturers are the communications service providers that deploy and operate the networks and services these service providers require network equipment that enables their networks and services to operate at increasingly faster speeds while providing rapidly expanding capacity and superior reliability to meet these demands network component and equipment manufacturers require test and measurement instruments systems and solutions for the development production and installation of each new network technology   communications and internet service providers also require a range of sophisticated test instruments and systems to evaluate network performance and to identify any sources of communications failure additionally these customers require advanced software and systems known as operations support systems to monitor and manage the network infrastructure and services on a continuous proactive basis to achieve either regulated or customerspecified service levels realtime monitoring of the network infrastructure also enables the implementation of additional services such as fraud detection which customers increasingly require of service providers in addition accurate monitoring enables service providers to bill more precisely for different types of network traffic   the market for cellular telephony has increased in recent years as the levels of wireless penetration in developed countries have grown rapidly many lesserdeveloped countries have decided to build wireless communications infrastructure to meet their nations’ needs for telephony rather than invest in expensive wirebased infrastructure to develop cellular telephone equipment manufacturers require electronic design software and test instruments and systems for the development of highfrequency communications circuits devices and systems cellular equipment manufacturers also require advanced highfrequency test instruments and systems to develop manufacture 4 and deploy cellular base stations for these wireless networks in addition the rapid growth of the cellular handset market has created a new market segment for automated test equipment to test cellular handsets on the factory floor further as new standards evolve in the wireless industry new test and measurement equipment and systems have to be developed to enable testing of the new standards in the research design and development and later in the manufacturing and deployment phases 

  we believe that in the last several years producers of networking communications equipment have increased their use of contract manufacturers contract manufacturers require test solutions that are particularly wellsuited for faster production and flexible for use in different applications recently mobile phone and appliance producers have also begun to increase their use of contract manufacturers including using contract manufacturers for functional test this requires specialized test products and services to address the particular needs of these highfrequency products 

 

   the electronics industry designs develops and manufactures a wide range of products including products produced in high volumes such as computers computer peripherals communications devices such as wireless handsets and personal digital assistants electronic components printed circuit assemblies and consumer electronics these components and printed circuit assemblies may be designed developed and manufactured by electronic components companies by original equipment manufacturers or by thirdparty contract manufacturers for the development and timely commercialization of new technologies original equipment manufacturers require stateoftheart test instruments systems and software design tools in order to design the products for efficient and costeffective manufacturing and validate product performance in a variety of configurations and environments   high volume manufacturers of electronics products such as printed circuit board assemblies require sophisticated automated test equipment to operate and perform highly accurate tests at speeds and volumes matching those of the production line this equipment includes incircuit testing systems automated xray inspection systems and automated optical inspection systems all of which examine the printed circuit assemblies for manufacturing defects manufacturers are also beginning to demand automated functional test systems which test an electronic device as if it were in its final environment   electronics manufacturing also requires standardized test instruments system components and complete solutions aerospace and defense are important markets for standardized electronic equipment because of the high electronic content of advanced defense systems and defenserelated communications and surveillance equipment we believe that defense purchasers are shifting from specialized test equipment to offtheshelf test products and systems 

 

   semiconductor test systems are used by semiconductor designers semiconductor manufacturers and electronic component manufacturers in the design manufacture and testing of a wide variety of semiconductor products including logic memory mixed analog and digital signal and systemonachip integrated circuits semiconductor test systems are sold to semiconductor manufacturers and assembly and test subcontractors to the semiconductor industry   demand for automated test equipment is driven primarily by the increased volume of semiconductor devices produced advances in semiconductor technology are also increasing demand for semiconductor test equipment the development of increasingly faster and more complex semiconductor devices stimulates demand for testers capable of evaluating these highspeed devices in addition the continuing integration of functions such as microprocessor logic and memory on a single integrated circuit has created a new category of device called systemonachip these devices require a new category of sophisticated and flexible automated test equipment 5 strategy   our test and measurement business pursues the following strategies to extend our global leadership position as the communications and electronics industries shift to new business models and value chains

   our chemical analysis business encompasses the natural gas petroleum refining petrochemical and chemical markets we sell gas and liquid chromatographs and gas and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry products and solutions into these markets petroleum refiners use our measurement solutions to analyze crude oil composition and perform other raw material analysis verify and improve refining processes and ensure the overall quality of gasoline fuels lubricants and other products our gas chromatographs are used to monitor consistent quality in the natural gas delivered to consumers and industry petrochemical and chemical producers use our gas and liquid chromatography products to measure and control the quality of their finished products and to verify the environmental safety of their operations 

 

   we develop and market analytical instrumentation for the environmental market for applications such as laboratory and field analysis and characterization of chemical pollutants in air water soils solid waste agriculture and food products environmental industry customers include all levels of government the industrial and manufacturing sectors engineering and consulting companies commercial testing laboratories colleges and universities we believe there will be more demand for environmental instrumentation in the asiapacific latin america and eastern europe regions as these regions implement new and stricter environmental regulations 

 

   our analytical and life sciencesinstrument solutions are used by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies in every phase of the drug development process this includes research into the basic causes and understanding of disease identification and development of new drugs obtaining regulatory approval manufacturing and distribution strategy   in order to maintain our leading position in the instrumentation solutions market our strategy is as follows 

 

   we will continue to focus resources on the development and growth of bioinstrumentation consumables and services solutions that increase understanding of the genetic cause of diseases in order to speed the development and increase the efficacy of new drugs 

 

   to address emerging markets in the asiapacific latin america and eastern europe regions we are broadening our worldwide distribution capabilities and developing less complex instrumentation with lower prices finally we continue to develop gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products that are smaller and more portable to meet increasing demand for use of these instruments outside of centralized laboratories 

 

   we seek to bring new products and technologies to market both through internal development and the strategic acquisition of technologies from third parties we are expanding our programs to offer customers early access to products under development to ensure that these products are meeting customer needs in addition our development of modular hardware and software platforms allows us to bring new generations of products to market faster 15   in addition to our internal efforts we consider acquisitions to complement our current products solutions and technologies and to accelerate our entry into strategic markets 

 

   we intend to build strategic relationships to enable us to develop products and services that complement existing technologies and products in our target markets for example through our relationship with caliper® technologies corporation we are conducting joint research and development in microfluidics   in addition through our strategic alliances we develop instruments that work with our partners’ products enabling us to offer our customers a broader range of products and solutions products   a key factor in our target markets is the need for new products that increase productivity of the end customer our chemical analysis products systems consumables and services enable our customers to research the genetic bases of disease and enable the development testing and use of new drugs and to analyze water air and soil for monitoring and remediation and to understand the properties of natural and manmade gases liquids and chemicallybased products our six main product lines chromatography spectrometry icpms bioinstrumentation including microarrays and related consumables and services are described below 

 

   we produce gas chromatography systems both portable and otherwise gas chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a gaseous mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present a gas chromatograph can analyze gas samples as well as solids and liquids that can be converted to a gaseous state most gas chromatographs have the approximate size and appearance of a large microwave oven   our instruments are used in laboratories involved in research and development quality assurance quality control and routine testing our products are used to test the quality and safety of food air and water to develop cleanerburning fuels and more effective pharmaceuticals and to test for alcohol in blood drugs in urine or explosive residues in crime scene evidence 

 

   liquid chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present these instruments are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses each module is about the size of a home videocassette recorder   highperformance liquid chromatographs are an essential tool in the pharmaceutical industry for basic research drug discovery drug development and quality control of new drugs other industry groups that utilize highperformance liquid chromatographs include life science research chemical development and manufacturing industry and government testing laboratories for safety quality and nutritional content of foods and beverages athlete monitoring for illegal drug use and environmental monitoring 

 

   mass spectrometers identify chemicals based on a chemical’s molecular mass and in many cases on characteristic patterns of fragment masses that result when a molecule is broken apart mass spectrometers can also be used to determine how much of a known chemical is present in a particular sample 16   mass spectrometer systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs in the pharmaceutical life science semiconductor and environmental industries the combined instruments are used to study and refine the chemical structure of proteins and other biological molecules as well as new drug candidates to determine the presence of impurities in semiconductors as they are manufactured or to identify heavy metals and other pollutants in soil and water 

 

   in december 1999 we announced the launch of a dna microarray program for the life sciences that incorporates technologies from both rosetta inpharmatics subsequently acquired by merck and oxford gene technology among others this program is intended to enable researchers to access gene expression information   using our highly flexible inkjet manufacturing process agilent makes both oligonucleotide and cdna microarrays this inkjet process allows us to deposit very small volumes per spot without stopping or making contact with the slide resulting in highdensity arrays with highly uniform spot shape in a very short period of time   in addition our genearray microarray scanner allows a researcher to use genechip arrays designed by affymetrix® to enable highspeed detection and characterization of large amounts of genetic information more recently agilent introduced its next generation scanner designed for use with its own microarrays as well as others consistent with agilent’s standardsbased platform approach this scanner can image up to 48 industry standard 1” x 3” glass microarray slides and have the data automatically exported in a text tabdelimited or xmlbased geml format   the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer instrument systems that we have developed through our relationship with caliper® technologies is the first integrated solution based on microfluidics and caliper labchip® technology for the analysis of a wide range of biological molecules including dna rna proteins and cells using miniature integrated biochemicalprocessing systems etched into glass the microchip allows the steps customarily performed in conventional instruments to be done using minute quantities of costly reagents in a fraction of the usual time

industry requirements   manufacturing   our manufacturing strategy supports our diverse product range and customercentric focus we assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock we employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times we selectively use partners to provide manufacturing capabilities outside our core competencies such as the manufacture of printed circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics we have manufacturing facilities in california and delaware in the united states china germany and japan 18   competition   the markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition our principal competitors include perkin elmer corp applied biosystems inc affymetrix shimadzu corporation thermo electron inc and waters   government regulation   the analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the united states by the environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals the act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by environmental protection agency for its effect on health and safety and placed on an environmental protection agency inventory of chemical substances therefore we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations if we fail to comply with the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products the environmental protection agency can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines civil penalties or criminal prosecution backlog   agilent believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from our inventories the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue related to our service and support businesses therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business research and development   research and development expenditures were 1349 million in 2001 1259 million in fiscal year 2000 and 879 million in fiscal year 1999 the vast majority of which was companysponsored we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services intellectual property   our general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or to give us a competitive advantage while we believe that our patents and applications have value in general no single patent is in itself essential in addition we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will provide significant competitive advantages international operations   our net revenue originating outside the united states as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 598 in fiscal year 2001 574 in fiscal year 2000 and 574 in fiscal year 1999 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments approximately 20 of our international revenue in the last three years was derived from japan longlived assets located outside of the united states as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 437 in fiscal year 2001 493 in fiscal year 2000 and 492 in fiscal 1999 approximately 169 of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal year 2001 and approximately 137 in fiscal years 2000 and 1999 19   most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we make certain sales in international markets directly from the united states   our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements unexpected changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations and differing protection of intellectual property we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt investment and finance receivable portfolios we incur the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the us and international response could exacerbate these risks for example there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia   however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 18 “segment information” of the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report materials   our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors in order to secure components we may enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers such commitments could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications semiconductor and electronics products has decreased for example in the year ended october 31 2001 we recorded inventoryrelated charges of approximately 459 million we could experience excess parts again and additional charges if demand continues to decrease by contrast during a market upturn our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our parts supply quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers in addition suppliers may discontinue certain components extend lead times limit supplies or increase price due to capacity constraints or other factors environmental   our research and development manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our company may not require our company to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements these laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 20   some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination that is undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard hewlettpackard has agreed to retain the liability for the contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation while we expect that hewlettpackard will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hewlettpackard hewlettpackard will have access to these properties to perform the remediation hewlettpackard has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties   in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located although hewlettpackard has agreed to indemnify us with respect to that subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the naming of our company will not affect hewlettpackard’s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters   we are liable and are indemnifying hewlettpackard for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by hewlettpackard excluding the properties undergoing remediation in addition we are indemnifying hewlettpackard for any liability associated with past noncompliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by hewlettpackard as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose us to material liability in the future   we are being indemnified by hewlettpackard with respect to all environmental liabilities for which hewlettpackard accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material and probable environmental liabilities being assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity executive

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements regarding the anticipated completion of transactions and our liquidity position and our expected overall growth that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to certain factors including those discussed below in “factors that may affect future results” and elsewhere in this annual report overview   our company incorporated in delaware in may 1999 is a global diversified technology organization that provides enabling solutions to high growth markets within the communications electronics and life sciences industries prior to our initial public offering of 159 percent of our stock in november 1999 we were a whollyowned subsidiary of hewlettpackard company “hp” hp distributed the remaining 841 percent of our stock to its stockholders on june 2 2000 in the form of a stock dividend basis of presentation   our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years refer to our fiscal year   the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations changes in cash flows and the financial position of our businesses we began accumulating retained earnings on november 1 1999   the 1999 consolidated financial statements were prepared using hp’s historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our historical results of operations the 1999 consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain hp corporate expenses including centralized research and development legal accounting employee benefits real estate insurance services information technology services treasury and other hp corporate and infrastructure costs the expense allocations were determined on bases that hp and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to us or the benefit received by us therefore the financial information presented in this annual report for 1999 is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone entity in 1999 discontinued operations   on august 1 2001 we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to koninklijke philips electronics nv “philips” pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for a total purchase price of 17 billion philips paid initial proceeds of 16 billion to us on august 1 2001 with further payments to follow pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement dated as of november 17 2000 as amended and supplemented by the amendment and supplemental agreement dated as of august 1 2001 the total purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the determination of the final purchased net assets and on our performance of certain services for philips since august 1 2001 we have received approximately 80 million of the 100 million purchase price holdback in additional proceeds from philips we expect to receive the remaining proceeds in 2002   our consolidated financial statements reflect our healthcare solutions business as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” “apb 30” the financial position results of operations and cash flows of our healthcare solutions business have been classified as 28 discontinued and prior periods have been restated including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining business segments we recorded an aftertax gain of 646 million as a result of this transaction we do not expect material adjustments to the gain when the determination of the final purchased net assets and the performance of certain services are complete 

  we are restricted from competing in the development manufacturing selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years for incremental fees we have provided certain support services to philips after august 1 2001 and we will continue to provide those services in the future a portion of these fees offset costs that include an element of fixed costs which are recognized in selling general and administrative expenses restructuring and asset impairment   in 2001 as a result of the economic downturn that has impacted many of the markets that we serve we have taken steps to restructure our businesses we have announced measures to cut discretionary costs to reduce the size of our workforce and to reduce the number of sites that we occupy on august 20 2001 we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 4000 or about nine percent by the middle of 2002 in november 2001 we announced a further reduction of 4000 jobs combined with other measures designed to restore profitability in the latter half of 2002 the total cost of these plans is estimated to be 350 million of which 154 million was recognized in 2001 of this amount 79 million was included in cost of products and services 17 million was included in research and development expenses and 58 million was included in selling general and administrative expenses as of october 31 2001 65 million in severance benefits had been paid and the remainder of the restructuring liability is expected to be utilized during 2002 in the second half of 2001 we reduced our workforce by approximately 3000 employees   in june 2001 we recognized a 74 million asset impairment charge with respect to our decision to cancel the development of a software system for our customer support activities we have entered into an agreement with hp to extend our use of their legacy customer support systems in place of the one that we were developing the decision to continue the use of hp’s systems enabled us to reduce costs at a critical time minimize disruption to our customers and businesses and to focus on our customers’ needs   in 1999 we recognized an impairment loss of 51 million related to a building that was under construction to house manufacturing operations for eightinch cmos semiconductor wafers at the time construction was stopped only the building shell was complete we concluded that the highest fair value to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office or general use facility acquisitions   on january 5 2001 we acquired objective systems integrators inc “osi” for approximately 716 million of this total 690 million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted using the purchase method of accounting the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets including goodwill the original goodwill balance of 593 million is being amortized over three years the net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition at october 31 2001 was 432 million osi is a leading provider of nextgeneration operationssupportsystem software for communications service providers and has become part of the test and measurement business   in july 1999 hp entered into an agreement with yokogawa electric corporation “yokogawa” to acquire yokogawa’s 25 percent equity interest in agilent technologies japan ltd for approximately 521 million in the initial step which occurred in january 2000 we purchased approximately 104 percent of agilent technologies japan ltd shares from yokogawa for approximately 206 million in the second step which occurred in april 2000 we purchased approximately 104 percent of additional agilent technologies japan ltd shares from yokogawa for approximately 216 million in 29 january 2001 we completed our acquisition of yokogawa’s 25 percent equity interest in agilent technologies japan ltd by purchasing the remaining 42 percent interest for approximately 99 million of the total purchase price 243 million was allocated to tangible assets and 278 million was attributed to goodwill which is being amortized over 10 years the remaining net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition was 240 million at october 31 2001 

  in addition to the osi and yokogawa acquisitions we acquired several other companies during 2001 2000 and 1999 which were not significant to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method the results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on fair market values at the date of acquisition residual amounts were recorded as goodwill inprocess research and development writeoffs have not been significant goodwill is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated economic life generally three to five years except as noted above   the net book value of goodwill and other intangible assets was 11 billion at october 31 2001 and 467 million at october 31 2000 sale of leasing portfolio   in the fourth quarter of 2000 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with tyco capital corporation “tyco capital” pursuant to which we have sold them substantially all of our leasing portfolio “tyco capital sale” over the course of the last five quarters the impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations of the lease portfolio sale is shown below    our service revenues and cost of services were reduced in 2001 as our portfolio of operating leases was purchased by tyco capital correspondingly product revenue and cost of products increased as a direct result of the tyco capital sale we expect future operating lease revenue to be further reduced because we also entered into a vendor financing arrangement with tyco capital whereby tyco capital will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis this agreement has been in place since the fourth quarter of 2000 as a result of this agreement and the tyco capital sale our lease revenue and associated costs have declined lease revenues as a percentage of service revenues for each of the last three fiscal years were 51 percent in 2001 235 percent in 2000 and 226 percent in 1999 property transactions   in february 2001 we sold a parcel of surplus land in san jose california for 287 million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of approximately 269 million in august 2001 we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern california for a total value of 289 million cyclical business and general economic conditions   the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products shifts in the semiconductor market electronics industry computer industry and telecommunications markets as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 30   in 2001 an economic downturn reduced consumer and capital spending in many of the worldwide markets that we serve it also has created an imbalance of supply and demand in the wireless and semiconductor manufacturing industries we are uncertain as to how long and how severe the current downturn may be in these markets in 2001 net revenue and net earnings were down 10 percent and 77 percent respectively compared to 2000 substantially all of the impacts of this decline occurred in our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses our earnings from continuing operations in 2000 declined 184 percent to a loss from continuing operations in 2001 additionally as a capital equipment provider our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses and in the economy we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results   our revenue and operating results for 2000 compared to 1999 improved as a result of growth in the communications and electronics markets impact of foreign currencies   we sell our products in many countries and a portion of our net revenue and costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies especially in the japanese yen and the euro our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program which is designed to minimize shortterm exposure to foreign currency fluctuations movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net revenues or operating expenses in the periods presented adoption of new accounting standards   effective november 1 2000 we adopted statement of financial account standards “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities” sfas no 133 as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carried at fair value changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings or stockholders’ equity depending on the intended use of the instrument the adoption of sfas no 133 in november 2000 resulted in a cumulative pretax reduction in earnings of 41 million 25 million aftertax primarily relating to the valuation of certain warrants to purchase securities and a pretax increase in other comprehensive income of 10 million   we enter into certain foreign exchange contracts primarily forwards and purchased options to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes   in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” during the fourth quarter of 2001 we adopted sab 101 retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year the cumulative effect of the adoption reflecting the deferral of net revenue and cost of products from october 31 2000 resulted in a cumulative pretax reduction in earnings of 74 million 47 million after tax as a result of adopting sab 101 delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for the fiscal year ended october 31 2001 the net impact on 2001 net revenue including amounts deferred at october 31 2001 was an increase of 67 million of net revenue and 29 million of cost of products which were included in the cumulative effect adjustment the results for the first three quarters of 2001 have been restated in accordance with sab 101 pro forma amounts for the periods beginning before november 1 2000 have not been presented as the effect of the change could not be reasonably determined 31 recent accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as a result of sfas no 141 all acquisitions completed after june 30 2001 are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the adoption of sfas no 141 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements we plan to adopt sfas no 142 in the first quarter of 2003 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june 30 2001 not be amortized until we adopt the new standard we will continue to amortize goodwill existing at june 30 2001 and to test all goodwill for impairment using the current method that uses an undiscounted cash flow test after adoption we will stop amortizing all goodwill and will begin to test goodwill for impairment pursuant to sfas no 142 that applies a fairvaluebased test we are assessing the further impacts of sfas no 142 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations   in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets we will be required to adopt sfas no 144 no later than fiscal year 2003 we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 144 and do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements results of continuing operations net revenue       excluding the tyco capital sale of 254 million in 2001 and 197 million in 2000 net revenue for 2001 decreased 112 percent compared to 2000 and net revenue for 2000 increased 342 percent compared to 1999 the decrease in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 related primarily to a slowdown in the telecommunications semiconductor and computer industries which has severely impacted our customers’ ability to purchase our products the increase in net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 was spurred by continued growth in net revenue from the communications and 32 electronics markets this was especially due to the robust demand for our wireless fiberoptics networking and imaging components within our semiconductor products business and for most products throughout our test and measurement business increased demand in asia also contributed to net revenue growth in 2000 

  the decrease in domestic net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets this slowdown has impacted our net revenue in the united states somewhat more severely than other parts of the world in contrast the increase in domestic net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets the increase in international net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to increased demand in asia particularly in taiwan korea and japan there was minimal currency impact on net revenue growth in 2000   the decrease in product revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily driven by a slowdown in communications and electronics markets the net revenue growth in 2000 was primarily due to growth in our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets a strengthening of the semiconductor industry and increased demand in asia the decline in service revenue for 2001 is primarily the result of the tyco capital sale and the decline in service contract renewal rates generally there is a lag between service revenue trends and product revenue trends this lag occurs because service revenue is directly related to the size of our installed base of products not covered by warranty costs and expenses    excluding the tyco capital sale and restructuring charges of 79 million in 2001 cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 101 percentage points compared to 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory during 2001 cost of products as a percentage of product revenue has increased due to these same factors mentioned above and higher discounts offered to our customers excluding the tyco capital sale in 2000 and the impairment charge of 51 million in 1999 cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue in 2000 decreased 16 percentage points compared to 1999 the decrease in 2000 was primarily attributable to higher volumes in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses as well as a more profitable product mix in the semiconductor products business   research and development expenses increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of continuing expenditures toward new product introductions our research and development efforts focus on potential new products covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations   selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to goodwill amortization relating to our 2001 acquisition of osi as a result of various costcutting initiatives in 2001 selling general and administrative expenses before the effect of goodwill and 33 other intangible amortization restructuring and asset impairment charges declined 12 percent compared to 2000 

  general overhead costs of 88 million in 2001 225 million in 2000 and 194 million in 1999 previously allocated to our healthcare solutions segment have been reallocated to each of the three remaining segments loss earnings from operations    excluding the tyco capital sale we had a loss from operations of 901 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of 810 million in 2000 and 422 million in 1999 excluding the restructuring charges and tyco capital sale we had a loss from operations of 447 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of 925 million in 2000 and 463 million in 1999 the decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the fact that net revenue declined much more rapidly than costs and expenses in the test and measurement and semiconductor businesses increased goodwill amortization related to recent acquisitions also contributed to the decrease the decrease was partially offset by the performance of our chemical analysis business the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to strong results in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses these improved results were partially offset by flat performance from our chemical analysis business and additional ongoing costs associated with operating on our own as an independent company other income expense net    other income expense net increased 207 million to 301 million in 2001 from 94 million in 2000 the increase was primarily due to the sale of land in san jose california which resulted in a pretax gain of 269 million the increase in other income expense net for 2001 compared to 2000 was partially offset by higher interest expense due to a higher average debt balance other income expense net increased 53 million to 94 million in 2000 from 41 million in 1999 the increase was primarily due to a pretax gain of 29 million related to the sale of equity investments that no longer supported our business strategies and interest income earned on the initial cash funding received from hp in 1999   we sold assets related to portions of our businesses to third parties during 2001 2000 and 1999 gross proceeds from these dispositions were 13 million in 2001 immaterial in 2000 and 71 million in 1999 gains from the dispositions included in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of earnings were 9 million in 2001 immaterial in 2000 and 50 million in 1999 benefit provision for taxes   the effective tax rate for continuing operations in 2001 was 19 percent for 2000 and 1999 the effective rate was 34 percent   in 2001 the change in the tax rate for continuing operations is due to the tax benefits arising from the losses caused by the recent global economic downturn this is offset by the impact of nondeductible goodwill from the acquisition of osi taxes on the sale of our healthcare solutions 34 business are reflected in the gain from sale of discontinued operations our future effective tax rate will continue to be calculated using an estimate of our pretax income and will be subject to the impact of future profitability the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as changes in the mix of our pretax earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates 

segment results   in 2001 our management changed its measure of the profitability of each of the business segments to exclude goodwill and other intangible amortization and nonrecurring items such as restructuring charges these items have been excluded for all periods presented test and measurement   our test and measurement business provides test instruments standard and customized test measurement and monitoring instruments and systems for the design manufacture and support of electronics and communications devices and software for the design of highfrequency electronic and communications devices and networks  net revenue   net revenue for 2001 decreased 111 percent compared to 2000 excluding the tyco capital sale total net revenue for 2001 declined 124 percent compared to 2000 the slowdown in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries was the main factor that caused the decline in net revenue for 2001 the slowdown was particularly sharp in the second half of 2001 as we became increasingly dependent on incoming orders which declined in virtually all of the product lines of our test and measurement businesses net revenue for 2000 increased 496 percent compared to 1999 the increase in 2000 was attributable to strong growth in the sales of our products to the optical wireless and networking markets in addition thirdparty manufacturing contractors added capacity to meet demand and increased their purchases of our test and measurement products   excluding the tyco capital sale net revenue from products for 2001 decreased 116 percent compared to 2000 the decrease in net revenue from products was primarily due to a slowdown in telecommunications and semiconductor industries net revenue from services and other for 2001 decreased 174 percent compared to 2000 primarily due to the tyco capital sale in addition certain customers have chosen not to renew their service contracts excluding the tyco capital sale net revenue from products for 2000 increased 501 percent compared to 1999 the increase was primarily due to the growing communications market and the increased demand in asia net revenue from services and other for 2000 increased 188 percent compared to 1999 35 costs and expenses   the following table shows the percentage point increase or decrease in our test and measurement business’ costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 2000 and 1999    cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory excluding the impacts of these charges cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased 54 percentage points in 2001 from 2000 due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue   the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to our continuing expenditures toward new product introductions loss earnings from operations   loss from operations in 2001 was a result of reduced demand which led to fewer sales and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory excluding the tyco capital sale loss from operations was 263 million compared to earnings from operations of 594 million in 2000 and 250 million in 1999 the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted primarily from higher net revenue semiconductor products   our semiconductor products business provides fiber optic communications devices and assemblies components and integrated circuits for wireless networking computing and printing applications image sensors and generalpurpose optoelectronic components  net revenue   the decrease in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a sharp decline in demand for our semiconductor products the global economic slowdown led to lower volumes in virtually all product lines of our semiconductor products business total net revenue for 2001 included 35 million of nonrecurring royalty revenue relating to changes in our agreement with adaptec inc the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was the result of strong growth in all semiconductor products including wireless networking and imaging components networking component growth was the result of growth in the sales of fiberoptic transceivers and highspeed networking products tailored for metro area network man as well as storage area networking products and gigabit ethernet local area network lan applications imaging products for digital cameras and optical mice also achieved particularly strong growth in 2000 as a percentage of net revenue for the semiconductor products business revenue from sales to hp consisting primarily of 36 applicationspecific integrated circuits and motion control products was 307 percent for 2001 303 percent for 2000 and 370 percent for 1999 

  in 2000 we expanded our existing joint venture relationship with philips to develop our manufacturing of lightemitting diodes “led” and transferred a portion of our led business into the joint venture leds are used for various lighting and display purposes since we do not have a majority ownership interest in the joint venture the revenue costs and expenses of the led business transferred to the joint venture are no longer consolidated in our results instead we record our portion of the joint venture’s net earnings or loss in other income expense net which in 2000 was minimal adjusting the 1999 base for revenues relating to the led business and our exit from the microprocessor business net revenue growth for 2000 would have been 403 percent costs and expenses   the following table shows the percentage point increase or decrease in our semiconductor products business’s costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2001 2000 and 1999    the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to increased inventory charges for excess and obsolete inventory as a result of reduced demand for our semiconductor products in addition due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue unfavorable mix and large shipments to single customers carrying deep discounts impacted cost of products as a percentage of net revenue unfavorably excluding the impacts of increased inventory charges cost of products as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 77 percentage points compared to 2000 cost of products as a percentage of net revenue for 2000 decreased 32 percentage points compared to 1999 the decrease related primarily to increased volumes and a more favorable product mix   the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was driven by a continued commitment to develop new products in the fiber optics highspeed networking and image position sensor businesses loss earnings from operations   the loss from operations in 2001 compared to earnings from operations in 2000 resulted primarily from lower net revenue and higher cost of products and expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from higher net revenue and lower cost of products as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses 37 chemical analysis   our chemical analysis business provides analytical instruments systems and services for chromatography spectroscopy bioinstrumentation and consumables to the chemical and life science markets  net revenue   the increase in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was the result of increased sales of our products in the life sciences market moderated by decreased sales of our products in our traditional chemical and petrochemical markets net revenue from products including liquid chromatography equipment bioanalyzers and microarrays grew more than 196 percent in 2001 compared to 2000 net revenue growth in 2000 as compared to 1999 was essentially flat as our products sold to the pharmaceutical and life sciences markets was partially offset by weakness in our traditional chemical and environmental markets new product releases contributed to increased sales of our liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products services and other revenue decreased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000 while it was flat in 2000 compared to 1999 costs and expenses   the following table shows the percentage point increase and decrease in our chemical analysis business costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2001 2000 and 1999    cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was relatively flat in 2001 compared to 2000 additional depreciation expense related to increased spending in manufacturing capacity for microarrays was offset by cost controls and improved operational efficiencies the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to startup costs for life sciences products   the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 reflected our efforts to reduce cost structures and discretionary expenses in 2000 the increase resulted primarily from increased life sciences research and development activities higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own earnings from operations   the increase in earnings from operations in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to higher net revenue and reduced spending resulting from our cost reduction measures in addition operational efficiencies arising out of manufacturing centralization efforts begun in fiscal 2000 and increased volumes contributed to the increase the decrease in earnings from operations in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to 38 the costs of operating on our own as well as planned research and development in life sciences to launch new products 

healthcare solutions — discontinued operations   our healthcare solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation the table below shows the results of our healthcare solutions business before general overhead allocations and net of the costs of divestiture results for the year ended october 31 2001 include operations from november 1 2000 to may 31 2001 the measurement date in accordance with apb 30 the net loss from discontinued operations of 58 million for the twomonth period following our may 31 2001 measurement date has been included in the gain from sale of discontinued operations the aftertax gain resulting from the sale of our healthcare solutions business including this loss was 646 million   the following table shows the detailed results of operations of our discontinued healthcare solutions business for 2001 2000 and 1999 these results are also included in our condensed consolidated statement of earnings as net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended 2001 2000 and 1999   financial condition 

 

   our financial position remained strong at october 31 2001 with cash and cash equivalents of 1170 million   cash usage from our continuing operations was 114 million in 2001 we generated cash from continuing operations of 536 million in 2000 compared to 341 million in 1999 in 2001 accounts payable used cash of 480 million and income tax payable used cash of 472 million offset by a decrease in outstanding accounts receivable totaling 933 million in 2000 and 1999 cash from continuing operations was primarily a result of net earnings in addition lower cash from continuing operations in 1999 resulted from a significant increase in accounts receivable due to particularly strong shipments in october 1999   net cash utilized for investing activities was 1365 million for 2001 compared to 1062 million for 2000 and 336 million for 1999 in all periods capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from divestitures and the disposal of excess unused or retired assets constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities we used 904 million for acquiring several businesses and 881 million for investments in property plant and equipment in 2001 we used 634 million in 2000 to pay for the first and second installments of the purchase of yokagawa’s minority interest in agilent technologies japan ltd along with investments in several other companies we purchased the remaining 42 percent of agilent technologies japan ltd’s shares owned by yokogawa in january 2001 hp provided the 39 funding for the entire yokogawa transaction in november 1999 in 2001 we sold the remaining portion of our portfolio of lease assets to tyco capital net proceeds from these sales transactions were 287 million 

  we have two revolving credit facilities with no outstanding balances at the end of 2001 those facilities are a 250 million facility that terminates on november 5 2005 and a 364day 250 million facility that terminated on november 2 2001 in november 2001 we extended the latter facility to november 1 2002 as of november 19 2001 the revolving credit facilities were amended to reflect new debt covenants in addition to these committed facilities we have access to uncommitted credit lines through our banking partners   on january 5 2001 we acquired objective systems integrators inc for a total purchase price of 716 million of this total 690 million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted   in february 2001 we sold surplus land in san jose california for 287 million net of transaction costs in august 2001 we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern california for a total value of 289 million   on august 1 2001 we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to philips and received approximately 16 billion in cash at that time we have subsequently received approximately 80 million in proceeds relating to the sale cash flows from discontinued operations include the proceeds from the sale and cash used in the operations of the healthcare solutions business during the year up until the date of sale   on november 27 2001 we announced the closing of a private offering of 115 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 percent senior convertible debentures due 2021 we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes and to fund potential acquisitions and restructuring costs the debentures are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of 3222 per share the debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in december 2004 and holders of the debentures have the ability to require us to repurchase the debentures in whole or in part on specified dates in 2006 2011 and 2016   prior to november 1 1999 cash receipts associated with our businesses were transferred to hp on a daily basis and hp provided funds to cover our disbursements accordingly we reported no cash or cash equivalents at october 31 1999 and 1998 in accordance with our separation agreement with hp as of november 1 1999 hp retained some of our assets and liabilities and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business in november and december 1999 hp made cash payments to us totaling 13 billion to fund our working capital and other needs of our operations as a separate standalone entity in addition hp transferred approximately 05 billion to fund our acquisition of yokogawa’s 25 percent minority interest in agilent technologies japan ltd the net proceeds of our initial public offering of 21 billion were received in november 1999 and immediately distributed to hp as a dividend   of the total 18 billion received from hp 11 billion was classified as net cash provided by financing activities and 07 billion was classified among several categories as net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended october 31 2000   our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets we believe that cash on hand plus the proceeds from our bond offering will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital capital expenditure research and development and restructuring requirements for the foreseeable future however we may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future we cannot assure that additional financing if needed will be available on favorable terms 40 factors that may affect future results 

 

   the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide in particular the communications semiconductor and electronics industries are currently in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and the erosion of average selling prices   we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 may exacerbate this downturn or cause it to linger any further decline in our customers’ markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price in addition we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available when required on acceptable terms 

 

   our semiconductor and test and measurement businesses have been experiencing lower revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders orders for our products and services have decreased in five of the past six quarters to scale back our operations and decrease our expenses in response to this decrease in demand for our products and services and decrease in our revenue we have reduced our workforce frozen hiring cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending we also have initiated shortterm facility closures to reduce production levels   earlier this year we announced our plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 4000 people or about 9 percent by the middle of 2002 in addition from may 1 to october 31 of this year we instituted a 10 percent reduction in pay applicable to all employees globally wherever legally permissible the reduction in pay took effect via a 10 percent reduction in hours for certain employees in accordance with local law on november 15 2001 we announced that we intend to further reduce our workforce by approximately 4000 people we also announced that we would reinstate the 10 percent pay reduction for approximately 2000 of our senior managers starting from the first quarter fiscal 2002 and that we would effectively reduce the salaries of our other employees by 5 percent wherever legally permissible effective february 2002 in addition to these measures we are continuing our initiatives to streamline our operations   there are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a new cost structure these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability and may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges in addition there is the risk that costcutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete each of the above measures could have longterm effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult for us to respond to customers limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 41 

 

   because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements currently we have excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the recent decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications electronics and semiconductor industries the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our earnings conversely if during a market upturn we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business 

 

   our earnings could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our orders for parts to market fluctuations in order to secure components for the production of products we may enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications semiconductor and electronics products has decreased for example in the year ended october 31 2001 we incurred a charge of approximately 459 million for inventoryrelated charges if the demand for our products continues to decrease we may experience an excess of parts again and be forced to incur additional charges by contrast during a market upturn our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our parts supply quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers in addition suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to substitute without significant reengineering of our products suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 

 

   given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability as demand for our products has decreased in recent periods our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter which are difficult to forecast the reduction in the backlog of our orders also has significantly affected our ability to efficiently plan production and inventory levels which has led to fluctuations in operating results in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall this may magnify the adverse impact of a revenue shortfall on our results of operations fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 

 

   we are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our current systems which are largely based on legacy systems that we created when we were a part of hewlettpackard we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data as a part of this effort we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage our business operations failure to smoothly and successfully implement this and other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run 42 our business in addition any failure or significant downtime in our legacy or new information systems could prevent us from taking customer orders shipping products or billing customers and could harm our business 

 

   we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to  

 

   since we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including    the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the us and international response could exacerbate these risks for example there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions such as southeast asia where we have significant manufacturing operations this could disrupt our ability to manufacture products or important parts as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to transport products to our customers or parts to other locations for continued 43 manufacture and assembly any such delay or interruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

   our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year and our attrition rate has dropped there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 

 

   in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from the investment community’s expectations in a given quarter in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newlyacquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including    a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to    all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted 

 

   historically our semiconductor products business has sold custom products to hewlettpackard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of hewlettpackard for the twelve months ended october 31 2001 hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 68 percent of our total net revenue and approximately 307 percent of our semiconductor products business’ net revenue 44   we have a license agreement with hewlettpackard that covers integrated circuit technology used in custom integrated circuits for hewlettpackard’s printers scanners and computers the license agreement provides that until november 2002 in some cases and until november 2009 in other cases we are prohibited with some exceptions from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products printer products including printer supplies accessories and components document scanners and computing products to third parties other than hewlettpackard   although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to hewlettpackard of custom integrated circuits used in printers scanners and computers the agreement does not require hewlettpackard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us in the event that hewlettpackard reduces its purchases of our custom integrated circuits we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers 

 

   some of our chemical analysis business’ products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the united states environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act we must conform the manufacture processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 

 

   some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hewlettpackard hewlettpackard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming negotiations and litigation in addition hewlettpackard will have access to our properties to perform remediation while hewlettpackard has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties we cannot be sure that hewlettpackard will fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations   we have agreed to indemnify hewlettpackard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hewlettpackard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with existing subsurface contamination at any of those properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 45 

 

   our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

 

   our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local health and safety packaging product content and labor regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products   our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation of other agencies such as the united states federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses will be harmed   our chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the toxic substances control act the federal food drug and cosmetic act and similar regulations therefore we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations 

 

   we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 

 

   third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology products and services   any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 46 the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements however we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 

  we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses we cannot assure you that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all in addition our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses has changed as a result of our separation from hewlettpackard in the past as a part of hewlettpackard we benefited from our access to hewlettpackard’s entire intellectual property portfolio when asserting counterclaims and negotiating crosslicenses with third parties our current patent crosslicense agreement with hewlettpackard gives us only a limited right to sublicense a portion of hewlettpackard’s intellectual property portfolio accordingly we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could have sublicensed hewlettpackard’s entire intellectual property portfolio nothing restricts hewlettpackard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to hewlettpackard by us 

 

   our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results   our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations in addition our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage   we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 

 

   our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their location we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity such as our production facilities headquarters and agilent laboratories in california and our production facilities in washington and japan if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility we selfinsure against such losses and do not carry catastrophic insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from earthquakes 

 

   our corporate headquarters a portion of our research and development activities other critical business operations and a certain number of our suppliers are located in california california has experienced periodic power shortages power outages could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of our suppliers distributors resellers and customers we selfinsure against such disruptions and do not carry catastrophic insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from 47 power shortages or outages in addition california has recently experienced rising energy costs that could negatively impact our results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar our exposure to exchange rate risks has been managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and loses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes   we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2001 and 2000 the analysis indicated that theses hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

     communications and internet service providers also require a range of
sophisticated test instruments and systems to evaluate network performance and
to identify any sources of communications failure additionally these customers
require advanced software and systems to monitor and manage the network
infrastructure on a continuous proactive basis to achieve either regulated or
customerspecified service levels realtime monitoring of the network
infrastructure also enables the implementation of additional services such as
fraud detection which customers increasingly require of service providers

     the market for cellular telephony has increased dramatically in recent
years as the levels of wireless penetration in developed countries have grown
rapidly many lesserdeveloped countries have decided to build wireless
communications infrastructure to meet their nations needs for telephony rather
than invest in expensive wirebased infrastructure to develop cellular
telephone equipment manufacturers require electronic design software and test
instruments and systems for the development of highfrequency communications
circuits devices and systems cellular equipment manufacturers also require
advanced highfrequency test instruments and systems to develop manufacture
and deploy cellular base stations for these wireless networks in addition the
rapid growth of the cellular handset market has created a new market segment for
automated test equipment to test cellular handsets on the factory floor
further as new standards evolve in the wireless industry new test and
measurement equipment and systems have to be developed to enable testing of the
new standards in the research and development and later in the manufacturing and
deployment phases

     we believe that in the last several years producers of networking
communications equipment have increased their use of contract manufacturers
contract manufacturers require test solutions that are
                                        3

particularly wellsuited for faster production and flexible for use in different
applications recently mobile phone and appliance producers have also begun to
increase their use of contract manufacturers including using contract
manufacturers for functional test this requires specialized test products and
services to address the particular needs of these highfrequency products

electronic equipment manufacturers

     the electronics industry designs develops and manufactures a wide range of
products including products produced in high volumes such as computers
computer peripherals electronic components printed circuit assemblies and
consumer electronics these components and printed circuit assemblies may be
designed developed and manufactured by electronic components companies by
original equipment manufacturers or by thirdparty contract manufacturers for
the development and timely commercialization of new technologies original
equipment manufacturers require stateoftheart test instruments systems and
software design tools in order to design the products for efficient and
costeffective manufacturing and validate product performance in a variety of
configurations and environments

     high volume manufacturers of electronics products such as printed circuit
board assemblies require sophisticated automated test equipment to operate and
perform highly accurate tests at speeds and volumes matching those of the
production line this equipment includes incircuit testing systems automated
xray inspection systems and automated optical inspection systems all of which
examine the printed circuit assemblies for manufacturing defects manufacturers
are also beginning to demand automated functional test systems which test an
electronic device as if it were in its final environment

     electronics manufacturing also requires standardized test instruments
system components and complete solutions aerospace and defense are important
markets for standardized electronic equipment because of the high electronic
content of advanced defense systems and defenserelated communications and
surveillance equipment we believe that following recent reductions in defense
spending defense purchasers are shifting from specialized test equipment to
offtheshelf test products and systems

semiconductor manufacturers

     semiconductor test systems are used by semiconductor designers
semiconductor manufacturers and electronic component manufacturers in the
design manufacture and testing of a wide variety of semiconductor products
including logic memory mixed analog and digital signal and systemonachip
integrated circuits semiconductor test systems are sold to semiconductor
manufacturers and assembly and test subcontractors to the semiconductor
industry

     according to vlsi research the market for automatic test equipment for
semiconductor manufacturing was approximately 33 billion in 1998 and is
expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 20 over the next
five years demand for this test equipment is driven primarily by the increased
volume of semiconductor devices produced advances in semiconductor technology
are also increasing demand for semiconductor test equipment the development of
increasingly faster and more complex semiconductor devices stimulates demand for
testers capable of evaluating these highspeed devices in addition the
continuing integration of functions such as microprocessor logic and memory
on a single integrated circuit has created a new category of device called
systemonachip these devices require a new category of sophisticated and
flexible automatic test equipment

applications which prepare data for transmission across fiber networks

     storage area networking as the volume of data that is being transmitted
processed and stored in networked environments has increased the market for
storage area network equipment which connects computers and storage devices
has grown dramatically the increase in data transmission speeds across networks
has created a demand for highspeed and highperformance storagetoserver and
servertoserver connectivity the fibre channel interconnect protocol a
standard for the transfer of information between computers and storage devices
defined by the american national standards institute was developed to meet this
growing demand fibre channel supports the transfer of large amounts of data
within storage area networks at speeds of one gigabit per second and greater and
provides high transmission reliability we supply a broad range of integrated
circuits fiber optic components and systems to manufacturers of storage area
network systems utilizing the fibre channel protocol such as compaq emc
corporation hitachi and nec we are aggressively pursuing new standards in the

government regulation

     the products developed and marketed by our healthcare solutions business
are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory bodies fda
regulations govern among other things the following product activities design
and development testing including animal and human studies labeling
premarket clearance or approval manufacturing storage advertising and
promotion and sales and distribution

     in the united states medical devices are classified on the basis of
controls deemed necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness class i
devices are subject to general controls such as labeling premarket
notification and adherence to the fdas quality system regulations which
incorporate current good manufacturing practices that are applicable to medical
devices class ii devices are subject to general and special controls special
controls may include performance standards postmarket surveillance patient
registries and fda guidelines most class iii devices are controlled through the
premarket approval process to ensure their safety and effectiveness

     prior to commercialization premarket notification clearance generally must
be obtained for class i and ii devices as well as certain class iii devices for
which the fda has not called for premarket approval preamendent class iii
devises for other class iii devices a premarket approval application is
required and must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate their
safety and effectiveness the notification or application typically includes
results of bench and laboratory tests when appropriate results of animal tests
and clinical studies a detailed description of the methods facilities and
controls used to manufacture the device and proposed labeling and advertising
literature

     most medical devices marketed by the agilent healthcare solutions business
are class ii or preamendment class iii devices which currently require only
premarket clearance the agilent healthcare solutions business does not market
any class iii device requiring premarket approval in the united states but it
may do so in the future or the fda may require by regulation that premarket
approval applications be submitted for our existing preamendment class iii
devices

     once clearance or approval is obtained fda oversight continues we are
required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the quality system
regulations for all our products the fda enforces the quality system
regulations through periodic inspections of our manufacturing operations and
those of our contract manufacturers the quality system regulations relate to
product design manufacture testing and quality
                                       17
page   20

assurance as well as to the maintenance of records and documentation we are
required to provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged
to have been associated with the use of our medical devices as well as on
product malfunctions that could contribute to death or serious injury the fda
also restricts the promotion of products for unapproved or offlabel uses

     if the fda believes we are not in compliance with the federal food drug
and cosmetic act or its regulations it can detain or seize our products order
or request a recall seek an injunction against future violations assess civil
penalties against us and initiate criminal proceedings against us

     compliance with other regulatory requirements is necessary to market our
medical devices outside the united states these regulations vary from country
to country

strategy

     in order to maintain our leading position in the analytical instrumentation
market our strategy is as follows

target highgrowth opportunities in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical
markets

     in fiscal year 2000 we formed a new life sciences business unit to address
opportunities in the pharmaceutical market through our strategic relationship
with caliper technologies we have developed instrumentation that enables
chemical analysis procedures to be performed within the caliper labchip device
we have recently begun marketing the labchip device which uses a technology
called microfluidics to manipulate minute quantities of various fluids

     we will continue to focus resources on the development of
bioinstrumentation that increases understanding of the genetic cause of
diseases in order to speed the development and increase the efficacy of new
drugs

focus on growth opportunities in current markets

     to address emerging markets in the asiapacific latin america and eastern
europe regions we are broadening our worldwide distribution capabilities and
developing less complex instrumentation with lower prices additionally in
order to differentiate our product offerings and increase our market share in
developed markets we intend to continue to grow our portfolio of services and
consumable products enabling us to offer our customers more complete solutions
finally we continue to develop gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy
products that are smaller and more portable to meet increasing demand for use of
these instruments outside of centralized laboratories

bring new products and technologies to market faster

     we seek to bring new products and technologies to market both through
internal development and the strategic acquisition of technologies from third
parties we are expanding our programs to offer customers early access to
products under development to ensure that these products are meeting customer
needs in addition our development of modular hardware and software platforms
allows us to bring new generations of products to market faster

     in addition to our internal efforts we consider acquisitions to complement
our current products solutions and technologies and to accelerate our entry
into strategic markets

leverage strategic relationships and alliances

     we intend to build strategic relationships to enable us to develop products
and services that complement existing technologies and products in our target
markets for example through our relationship with caliper technologies we are
conducting joint research and development in microfluidics
                                       19
page   22

     in addition through our strategic alliances we develop instruments that
work with our partners products enabling us to offer our customers a broader
range of products and solutions

products

     a key factor in our target markets is the need for new products that
increase productivity of the end customer our chemical and life sciences
analysis products systems and services enable our customers to analyze water
air and soil for monitoring and remediation to understand the properties of
natural and manmade gases liquids and chemicallybased products and to
advance knowledge of the genetic basis of disease and enable the development
testing and use of new drugs our four main product lines chromatography
spectroscopy bioinstrumentation and related consumables are described below

gas chromatography

     we produce gas chromatography systems both portable and otherwise gas
chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a gaseous mixture to determine
the quantity and identity of the molecules present a gas chromatograph can
analyze gas samples as well as solids and liquids that can be converted to a
gaseous state most gas chromatographs have the approximate size and appearance
of a large microwave oven

     our instruments are used in laboratories involved in research and
development quality assurance quality control and routine testing our
products are used to test the quality and safety of food air and water to
develop cleanerburning fuels and more effective pharmaceuticals and to test
for alcohol in blood drugs in urine or explosive residues in crime scene
evidence

liquid chromatography

     liquid chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to
determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present these instruments
are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that
perform specific analyses each module is about the size of a home videocassette
recorder

     highperformance liquid chromatographs are an essential tool in the
pharmaceutical industry for basic research drug development and clinical trials
of new drugs other industry groups that utilize highperformance liquid
chromatographs include chemical development and manufacturing industry and
government testing laboratories for safety quality and nutritional content of
foods and beverages athlete monitoring for illegal drug use and environmental
monitoring

mass spectroscopy

     mass spectroscopy systems break molecules into their component parts and
analyze these parts our mass spectrometers range in size from that of a small
microwave oven to that of a mediumsized refrigerator

     mass spectroscopy systems are typically used in combination with gas or
liquid chromatographs in the pharmaceutical semiconductor and environmental
industries the combined instruments are used to study and refine the chemical
structure of new drugs to determine the presence of impurities in
semiconductors as they are manufactured or to research the presence of heavy
metals and other unwanted substances in soil and water

bioinstrumentation

     in december 1999 we announced the launch of a dna microarray program for
the life sciences that incorporates technologies from both rosetta inpharmatics
and ogt among others this program is intended to enable researchers to access
gene expression information in addition our genearray system allows a
researcher to use genechip arrays designed by affymetrix to enable highspeed
detection and characterization of large amounts of genetic information

                                       20
page   23

     the new agilent 2100 bioanalyzer instrument systems that we have developed
through our relationship with caliper technologies integrate a large number of
chemicalanalysis procedures onto a single chip we develop and distribute
instrumentation that extracts and analyzes data from the microchip developed by
caliper technologies using advanced microfluidics technology using miniature
integrated chemicalprocessing systems etched into glass silicon quartz or
plastic the microchip allows the steps customarily performed in conventional
instruments to be done using minute quantities of costly liquids in a fraction
of the usual time

consumables

     we also offer consumable products including chromatograph columns
analytical reagents and other accessories and supplies used by our customers
during the analytical experimentation process columns are metal or glass tubes
containing various substances that are inserted into chromatographs to assist in
the process of separating compounds into their constituent parts reagents are
chemicals used to perform analysis on the resulting constituent parts other
accessories and supplies we provide range from rubber rings to syringes to
safety glasses

     our offerings include both generic consumables where we seek to
distinguish our products on price selection and customer loyalty and
proprietary consumables developed by us where we offer exclusive technology

customer orders and make standard products to stock we employ advanced
manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and
manufacturing cycle times we selectively use partners to provide manufacturing
capabilities outside our core competencies such as the manufacture of printed
circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics we have manufacturing
facilities in california and delaware in the united states china germany and
japan

competition

     the markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are
characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition our
principal competitors include perkin elmer corp applied biosystems inc
shimadzu corporation thermo electron inc and waters

     our ability to compete effectively depends upon a number of factors
including our ability to

      produce highquality and reliable products

      introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner

      provide favorable overall cost of ownership and

      provide product and service solutions that complement and support our
       main product lines

government regulation

     the chemical analysis product and related consumables marketed by our
chemical and life sciences analysis business are subject to regulation in the
united states by the environmental protection agency under the toxic substances
control act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws
the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the
testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of
regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and
export of chemicals the act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical
in the united states that has not been reviewed by environmental protection
agency for its effect on health and safety and placed on an environmental
protection agency inventory of chemical substances in addition our chemical
analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test
compliance with the toxic substances control act the federal food drug and
cosmetic act and similar regulations therefore we must continually adapt our
chemical analysis products to changing regulations if we fail to comply with
the notification recordkeeping and other requirements in the manufacture or
distribution of our products the environmental protection agency can obtain an
order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of
a product that contains a chemical that is out of compliance or we could face
fines civil penalties or criminal prosecution

backlog

     agilent believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future
business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from our shelf
inventories the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of
net revenue related to our service and support businesses therefore we believe
that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business

research and development

     we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid
technology changes frequent new product and service introductions and evolving
industry standards without the timely introduction of new
                                       22
page   25

products services and enhancements our products and services are likely to
become technologically obsolete over time in which case revenue and operating
results would suffer there can be no assurance that such new products and
services if and when introduced will achieve market acceptance after the
products and services are developed we must quickly manufacture and deliver
such products and services in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet
demand

     research and development expenditures were 1258 million in fiscal year
2000 997 million in fiscal year 1999 and 948 million in fiscal year 1998 we
anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development
expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing
flow of innovative highquality products and services

intellectual property

     our general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property
protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into
our products and services or to give us a competitive advantage while we
believe that our patents and applications have value in general no single
patent is in itself essential in addition we cannot assure you that any of our
proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that
our rights will provide significant competitive advantages

international operations

     our net revenue originating outside the united states as a percentage of
our total net revenue was approximately 558 in fiscal year 2000 552 in
fiscal year 1999 and 544 in fiscal year 1998 the majority of which was from
customers other than foreign governments approximately 19 of our international
revenue in the last three years was derived from japan

     most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales
subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through
various representatives and distributors however we make certain sales in
international markets directly from the united states

     our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in
foreign operations including changes in a specific countrys or regions
political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export
licensing requirements the overlap of different tax structures unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing
widespread operations differing labor regulations and differing protection of
intellectual property we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and
may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt investment
and finance receivable portfolios we incur

     we do a portion of our businesses in korea and japan which have been
subject to increased economic instability in recent years the recurrence of
weakness in these economies or weakness in other international economies could
have a significant negative effect on our future operating results however we
believe that our international diversification provides stability to our
worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in
any single country financial information about our international operations is
contained in note 18 segment information of the consolidated financial
statements included in item 8 of this report

materials

     our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors
electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic
resins and sheet metal we believe that the materials and supplies necessary for
our manufacturing operations are presently available in the quantities required
we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial
number of vendors for many of our products we have existing alternate sources
of supply or such sources are readily available in certain instances however
we enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with or make advance payments
to certain suppliers to ensure supply portions of our manufacturing operations
are dependent on the ability of

                                       23
page   26

suppliers to deliver quality components subassemblies and completed products in
time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules the failure of
suppliers to deliver these components subassemblies and products in a timely
manner may adversely affect our operating results until alternate sources could
be developed in addition we periodically experience constrained supply of
certain component parts in some product lines as a result of strong demand in
the industry for those parts such constraints if persistent may adversely
affect our operating results however we believe that alternate suppliers or
design solutions could be arranged within a reasonable time so that material
longterm adverse impacts would be minimized

environmental

     our research and development manufacturing and distribution operations
involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international
federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment
we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health
and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to
regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and
operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be
completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of
environmental and health and safety laws to our company may not require our
company to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number
of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product
packaging and product content requirements these laws are gradually becoming
more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures

     some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have
subsurface contamination that is undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard
hewlettpackard has agreed to retain the liability for the contamination
perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising
out of the contamination the determination of the existence and cost of any
additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and timeconsuming
negotiations and litigation while we expect that hewlettpackard will meet its
remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard there can be no
guarantee that it will do so under our agreement with hewlettpackard
hewlettpackard will have access to these properties to perform the remediation
hewlettpackard has agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at
those properties during the course of the remediation but there can be no
guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be
required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation
remediation could also harm onsite operations and the future use and value of
the properties

     in addition some of these properties are undergoing remediation by
hewlettpackard under an order of an agency of the state in which the property
is located although hewlettpackard has agreed to indemnify us with respect to
that subsurface contamination it is possible that one or more of the
governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders the
naming of our company will not affect hewlettpackards obligation to indemnify
us with regard to these matters

     we are liable and are indemnifying hewlettpackard for any contamination
found at all facilities transferred to us by hewlettpackard excluding the
properties undergoing remediation in addition we are indemnifying
hewlettpackard for any liability associated with past noncompliance with
environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred
to us by hewlettpackard as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that
related to our businesses while we are not aware of any material liabilities
associated with such indemnified matters there is no guarantee that such
contamination or regulatory noncompliance does not exist and will not expose
us to material liability in the future

     we are being indemnified by hewlettpackard with respect to all
environmental liabilities for which hewlettpackard accrued a reserve and we are
not aware of any material and probable environmental liabilities being assumed
by us which are not subject to the indemnity

     the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this
annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking
statements including without limitation statements regarding the anticipated
completion of transactions and our liquidity position that involve risks and
uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from the results
contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to certain factors
including those discussed below in factors that may affect future results and
elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

overview

     on march 2 1999 hewlettpackard company hewlettpackard announced a
plan to create a separate company subsequently named agilent technologies that
comprised hewlettpackards test and measurement semiconductor products
healthcare solutions and chemical analysis businesses related portions of
hewlettpackard laboratories and associated infrastructure on november 1
1999 we began operating as a separate standalone company on november 18
1999 we launched our initial public offering of 72000000 shares of common
stock at 30 per share after the completion of our initial public offering in
november 1999 hewlettpackard owned approximately 841 of our outstanding
common stock on november 23 1999 we paid the net proceeds of the offering of
21 billion to hewlettpackard as a dividend on april 7 2000 hewlettpackard
announced that its board of directors had declared a stock dividend of all of
hewlettpackards shares in us the dividend was distributed on june 2 2000 to
hewlettpackard shareholders of record as of may 2 2000 the distribution was
made on the basis of 03814 of an agilent share for each hewlettpackard common
share outstanding

     we were incorporated in delaware in may 1999 as a whollyowned subsidiary
of hewlettpackard our businesses historically were operated as internal units
of hewlettpackard in november 1999 hewlettpackard transferred to us a
majority of the assets and liabilities relating to our businesses and also
provided us with cash funding of approximately 11 billion hewlettpackard
retained some of our assets and liabilities including our accounts receivable
and accounts payable accrued payroll and related items and taxes payable
except deferred taxes and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities
related to its business including some of the accounts receivable accounts
payable and other liabilities of agilent technologies japan ltd formerly
hewlettpackard japan ltd in addition hewlettpackard transferred to us
521 million to fund our acquisition of yokogawa electric corporations 25
minority equity ownership of agilent technologies japan ltd in december 1999
hewlettpackard provided us with additional cash funding of approximately 200
million based on our and hewlettpackards balance sheets as of october 31
1999

     we have entered into various agreements with hewlettpackard related to
certain ongoing relationships between the companies in addition we have
entered into agreements with hewlettpackard under which hewlettpackard will
provide services to us during a transition period which began november 1 1999
for a brief description of these agreements see note 14 transactions with
hewlettpackard of the consolidated financial statements the agreements
relate primarily to information technology customer financing accounting and
administrative and building services under these agreements we reimburse
hewlettpackard for its cost of the service plus 5 the transition period
varies depending on the agreement but is generally less than two years some of
the agreements including those for building services and information technology
services may be extended beyond the initial transition period if these
agreements are extended we will reimburse hewlettpackard at its cost plus 10
for information technology services and most other services and at negotiated
market rates for building services the agreements do not necessarily reflect
the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our
providing the applicable services ourselves however we believe that purchasing
these services from hewlettpackard provides us with an efficient means of
obtaining these services during the transition period in addition we provide
some transition services to hewlettpackard for which we are reimbursed at our
cost plus 5

basis of presentation

     our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and
dates refer to our fiscal year

     the 2000 consolidated financial statements reflect the results of
operations changes in cash flows and the financial position of our businesses
we began accumulating retained earnings on november 1 1999

     the 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements were prepared using
hewlettpackards historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our
historical results of operations the 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial
statements include allocations of certain hewlettpackard corporate expenses
including centralized research and development legal accounting employee
benefits real estate insurance services information technology services
treasury and other hewlettpackard corporate and infrastructure costs the
expense allocations were determined on bases that hewlettpackard and we
considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided
to us or the benefit received by us therefore the financial information
presented in this financial report for 1999 and 1998 is not indicative of our
financial position results of operations or cash flows in subsequent periods
nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position results of
operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone
entity in those periods prior to 2000

restructuring asset impairment and other charges

     in august 2000 we announced a restructuring of our healthcare solutions
business the restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction through severance
programs as well as consolidation of our business operations since the
announcement 396 regular employees located in the united states asia pacific
and europe have accepted severance packages and 200 temporary employees have
been terminated we recognized a 21 million pretax restructuring charge
comprised of 13 million for estimated severance benefits and 8 million for
noncash asset writedowns of this amount 11 million was included in cost of
products 4 million in cost of services and other the remainder was included
in other operating expense line items as of october 31 2000 2 million in
severance benefits has been paid and charged against the liability the reminder
of the liability is expected to be utilized during 2001

     in 1999 we recognized an impairment loss of 51 million related to a
building that was under construction for the intended purpose of housing
manufacturing operations for eightinch cmos semiconductor wafers at the time
construction was stopped only the building shell was complete after exhaustive
efforts to find a semiconductor manufacturing partner to utilize the building
for its initial intended use management concluded that the highest fair value
to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office
or general use facility in 2000 we actively marketed the building shell
without success in late 2000 in response to the increased demand in the
wireless semiconductor market and our need to increase gallium arsenide gaas
manufacturing capacity management decided to resume construction of a portion
of the building shell when completed this portion of the building will
manufacture sixinch gaas semiconductor wafers we anticipate that the completed
manufacturing facility will be put into service sometime in 2002 at which time
depreciation will commence

     during 1998 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 163 million
related to the transfer of the production of certain semiconductor wafers to a
thirdparty contractor of this amount 138 million was included in cost of
products 7 million in research and development and 18 million in selling
general and administrative expenses included in this charge was 85 million for
noncash asset writedowns of equipment that was subsequently abandoned or sold
also included in this charge was 78 million for employee severance benefits
that have been paid

     also during 1998 we recorded a pretax charge of 37 million for the
writedown of an investment in convertible preferred stock of a medical products
company to its fair value because management had determined the impairment was
not temporary

sale of leasing portfolio to cit

     in the fourth quarter of 2000 we entered into a vendor financing agreement
with the cit group inc cit whereby cit will provide equipment financing and
leasing services to our customers on a global basis

                                       31

agilent financial services inc afs and is offering financing products to
our customers under this name cit through afs will be providing funding and

and collections we also entered into an asset purchase agreement with cit
pursuant to which we sold them certain portions of our us portfolio of lease
assets during the fourth quarter of 2000 net proceeds from this sales
transaction were 234 million and we recognized 212 million in net revenue and
89 million in cost of products we will be selling additional portions of our
portfolio of lease assets to cit during 2001 pursuant to various asset purchase
agreements

sale of healthcare solutions business to philips

     in the first quarter of 2001 we agreed to sell our healthcare solutions
business to koninklijke philips electronics nv philips for approximately
17 billion most of our healthcare solutions business operational facilities
and certain associated assets and liabilities will transfer to philips
virtually all employees of our healthcare solutions business including 100
percent of the healthcare solutions businessdedicated infrastructure employees
will be offered employment by philips or transferred to philips subject to
local statutory laws the estimated amount of net assets to be transferred is
400 million we will be restricted from competing in the development
manufacturing selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years
the sale is expected to be completed by midcalendar year 2001 subject to
customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions

cyclical business and general economic conditions

     the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on
customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for
their products shifts in the semiconductor market electronics industry
computer industry and telecommunications markets as well as rapidly shifting
global economic conditions have had significant impacts on our businesses in
portions of some of these markets we have started to see softening which could
harm our businesses our revenue and operating results for 2000 compared to 1999
have improved as a result of an upturn in the semiconductor industry
additionally as a capital equipment provider our revenue is driven by the
capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often
delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses and
in the economy we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in
the future given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed variability in
revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our
quarterly and annual results

economic conditions in asia

     beginning in the second half of 1998 and continuing into the first half of
1999 our revenue and operating results declined as a result of the downturn in
asian economies particularly in korea and japan many of our major customers
particularly those in the semiconductor and electronics industries delayed or
canceled purchases of our products this had a significant impact on us
particularly our test and measurement business these conditions began to
improve in the second half of 1999 and accordingly our revenue and operating
results improved

impact of foreign currencies

     we sell our products in many countries and a portion of our sales and a
portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies
especially in the japanese yen and the euro in 2000 compared to 1999 the us
dollar strengthened against both the japanese yen and the euro which had an

effect on our net revenue and operating expense growth our foreign currency
exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program which is
designed to minimize exposure to foreign currency fluctuations

recent accounting pronouncements

     in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities fas 133 this statement as amended establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires
recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and
measurement of those instruments at fair value the statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 we expect the adoption of fas 133
during first quarter of 2001 will result in a cumulative after tax expense of
26 million additionally an unrealized gain related to foreign currency
hedging of approximately 7 million net of tax will be recorded in other
comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet

     in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements this
staff accounting bulletin as amended is effective no later than the fourth
quarter of 2001 we currently do not believe the adoption will have a material
annual impact on our consolidated financial statements

net revenue

     total net revenue increased 293 percent to 108 billion in 2000 from 1999
and 48 percent to 83 billion in 1999 from 1998 excluding the sale of certain
portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit net

                                       33

revenue increased 268 percent in 2000 from 1999 the increase in 2000 was
spurred by continued growth in net revenue from the communications and
electronics markets this was especially due to the robust demand for our test
and measurement and semiconductor products more specifically for our wireless
fiberoptics networking and imaging components increased demand in asia also
contributed to net revenue growth in 2000 these effects were partially offset
by a decline in net revenue from our healthcare solutions business net revenue
for 2000 from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat the increase
in 1999 compared to 1998 was primarily due to growth in the communications
market improvement in economic conditions in asia and strengthening of the
semiconductor industry in general

     united states revenue increased 276 percent to 48 billion in 2000 and
increased 31 percent to 37 billion in 1999 international revenue increased
307 percent to 60 billion in 2000 and increased 62 percent to 46 billion
in 1999 domestic growth came primarily from our businesses which serve the
communications and electronics markets which was partially offset by a slowdown
in our healthcare solutions business the relatively higher net revenue growth
internationally was primarily attributable to increased demand in asia
particularly in taiwan korea and japan there was minimal currency impact on
net revenue growth in 2000 in the last half of 1998 and the first half of 1999
economic conditions in asia adversely affected revenue from sales of our
products and services to customers in korea and japan in addition global
weakness in the semiconductor industry caused our product revenue to decline in
1998 and into the first half of 1999 these conditions began to improve in the
second half of 1999 and accordingly our revenue improved both within the
united states and internationally

     in 2000 compared to 1999 revenue from products increased 323 percent
while revenue from services and other increased 119 percent in 1999 compared
to 1998 revenue from products increased 32 percent while revenue from services
and other increased 147 percent the relatively higher product revenue growth
in 2000 was primarily due to growth in our businesses which serve the
communications and electronics markets a strengthening of the semiconductor
industry and increased demand in asia generally there is a lag between service
revenue growth and product revenue growth this lag occurs because service
revenue increases as our installed base of products increases and warranty
periods expire lower product revenue growth in 1999 was primarily due to weak
economic conditions in asia and weak demand in the semiconductor industry

earnings from operations

     earnings from operations increased 421 percent to 11 billion in 2000
from 1999 and increased 676 percent to 741 million in 1999 from 1998
excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to
cit and the restructuring charges related to our healthcare solutions business
earnings from operations increased 283 percent in 2000 from 1999 the increase
in 2000 was primarily due to strong results in the test and measurement and
semiconductor products businesses these improved results were partially offset
by weak performance from our healthcare solutions business flat performance
from our chemical analysis business additional ongoing costs associated with
operating on our own and previously planned research and development in the life
sciences the increase in 1999 was due to higher net revenue combined with cost
savings of approximately 80 million as a result of the 1998 restructuring
also 1999 results included a 51 million asset impairment charge related to a
building under construction for the intended purpose of housing manufacturing
operations for eightinch cmos semiconductor wafers

     as a percentage of net revenue cost of products and services decreased 15
percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 40 percentage points in 1999
from 1998 excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease
assets to cit and the 1999 impairment charge of 51 million cost of products
and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased 06 percentage points in
2000 from 1999 the decrease in 2000 was primarily attributable to higher
volumes in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses as
well as a more profitable product mix in the semiconductor products business
the decrease was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies related to
parts shortages manufacturing consolidations and our healthcare solutions
business restructuring charges in 1999 all four of our business segments
recorded improvement in cost of products and services and other as a percentage
of net revenue with semiconductor products accounting for the most significant
improvement due primarily to cost improvements resulting from the 1998
restructuring
                                       34
page   37

     operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 06 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and 07 percentage points in 1999 from 1998 the
increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to
operating on our own and higher marketing costs the increase in 1999 was due to
higher advertising and branding expenses related to our becoming an independent
company this effect was partially offset by higher net revenue

     research and development expenses increased 262 percent in 2000 compared
to 1999 and 52 percent in 1999 compared to 1998 these increases reflect
ongoing efforts in developing new products and new technologies for the
wireless networking and life sciences markets selling general and
administrative expenses increased 333 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 76 percent
in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher
infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher marketing
costs including branding expenses also goodwill amortization related to
recent acquisitions contributed to the increase in operating expenses in 2000
in 1999 expense reductions resulting from the 1998 restructuring and other cost
containment measures were offset by costs including product advertising and
branding expenses related to our becoming a standalone entity

other income expense net

     other income expense net increased 65 million to 111 million in 2000
from 46 million in 1999 the increase in 2000 was primarily due to
approximately 29 million of gain on sales of equity investments that no longer
supported our business strategies and interest income earned on the initial cash
funding received from hewlettpackard included in 1999 were gains of 54
million related to the divestiture of several portions of our businesses

provision for taxes

     as a result of the impacts of the anticipated sale of our healthcare
solutions business the acquisition of osi and possible changes in our mix of
pretax earnings our 2001 effective tax rate may change our future effective
tax rates will also continue to be subject to the impacts of business
acquisitions and dispositions as well as changes in the mix of our pretax
earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates

net revenue

     net revenue from our test and measurement business increased 496 percent
to 61 billion in 2000 from 1999 and remained essentially unchanged in 1999
from 1998 excluding the sale of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit net
revenue increased 449 percent in 2000 from 1999 the increase in 2000 was
attributable to strong growth in the sales of our products into the optical
wireless and networking markets also thirdparty manufacturing contractors
added capacity to meet demand and increased their purchases of our test and
measurement products net revenue growth in 1999 was negatively affected by
weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in asia due to
competitive pressures and difficult market conditions we granted more pricing
discounts and customer allowances than in previous years this impact was
partially offset by increased sales volumes of communications products and
optical networks in the second half of 1999 as market conditions improved

     net revenue from products increased 558 percent in 2000 from 1999 and
decreased 30 percent in 1999 from 1998 excluding the sale of certain portions
of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit net revenue from

other increased 188 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 146 percent in 1999 from
1998 the relatively greater product revenue growth in 2000 was primarily due to
the growing communications market and the increased demand in asia generally
there is a lag between service revenue growth and product revenue growth this
lag occurs because service revenue increases as our installed base of products
increases and warranty periods expire product revenue decreased in 1999
primarily due to weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in

earnings from operations

     earnings from operations from our test and measurement business increased
1382 percent to 898 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 83 percent to
377 million in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000 resulted primarily from
higher net revenue as discussed above in 1999 the increase resulted from lower
cost of products and services and other partially offset by higher operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue

     cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased 12
percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and 20 percentage points in 1999 from 1998
the decrease in 2000 was primarily due to higher net revenue partially offset by
manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in our efforts to meet customer demand
the decrease in 1999 was due to cost savings resulting from the 1998
restructuring and was partially offset by the effect of lower volumes of
products sold primarily wireless communication test equipment and automated
test equipment and higher service revenue and the associated higher cost of
this revenue

     operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased 42 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and increased 12 percentage points in 1999 from 1998
the decrease in 2000 was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher
expenses the increase in 1999 from 1998 was due to slightly lower net revenue
combined with higher levels of expense in 1999 continued savings from cost
reduction programs initiated in the second half of 1998 partially offset this
trend however costs incurred as part of becoming a standalone entity
particularly costs related to branding moved overall operating expenses higher

     research and development expenses increased 238 percent in 2000 compared
to 1999 and were unchanged in 1999 compared to 1998 the increase in 2000
reflects increased activity in new product development in the communications
market selling general and administrative expenses increased 403 percent in
2000 from 1999 and increased 34 percent in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000
was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own
as well as higher selling and marketing costs including branding expenses in
1999 cost reduction programs initiated in 1998 slowed overall expense growth
and significantly decreased some variable operating costs

net revenue

     net revenue from our semiconductor products business increased 285 percent
to 22 billion in 2000 from 1999 and 94 percent to 17 billion in 1999 from
1998 the increase in 2000 was the result of strong growth in all semiconductor
products including wireless networking and imaging components networking
component growth was the result of growth in the sales of fiberoptic
transceivers and highspeed networking products tailored for metro area network
man as well as storage area networking products and gigabit ethernet local
area network lan applications imaging products for digital cameras and
optical mice also achieved particularly strong growth in 2000 the increase in
1999 was achieved despite the sale of the

power amplifier business in late 1998 if net revenue in 1998 were adjusted to
exclude revenue of the power amplifier business net revenue would have
increased by 152 percent in 1999 over 1998 net revenue growth in 1999
primarily reflects increased shipments of fiber optics products application
specific integrated circuits asics motion control products wireless
semiconductor products and highspeed networking products as a percentage of
net revenue for the semiconductor products business revenue from sales to
hewlettpackard consisting primarily of asics and motion control products was
303 percent in 2000 370 percent in 1999 and 345 percent in 1998

     in 2000 we expanded our existing joint venture relationship with philips
to develop our manufacturing lightemitting diodes led and transferred a
portion of our led business into the joint venture leds are used for various
lighting and display purposes since we do not have a majority ownership
interest in the joint venture the revenue costs and expenses of the led
business transferred to the joint venture are no longer consolidated in our
results instead we record our portion of the joint ventures net earnings or
loss in other income expense net which in 2000 was minimal adjusting the
1999 base for revenues relating to the led business and our exit from the
microprocessor business net revenue growth for 2000 would have been 403
percent

earnings loss from operations

     earnings from operations from our semiconductor products business increased
1030 percent to 270 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 2255 percent to
133 million in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000 resulted from higher net
revenue and lower cost of products as a percentage of net revenue partially
offset by higher operating expenses the increase in 1999 resulted from higher
revenue and cost savings from the 1998 restructuring

     cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased 67 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 135 percentage points in 1999 from 1998
adjusting for the 1999 impairment charge of 51 million and the transfer of a
portion of our led business to philips cost of products as a percentage of net
revenue decreased 31 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 the decrease in 2000
was primarily related to increased volumes and a more favorable product mix
adjusting for both the 1999 impairment charge and the 1998 restructuring cost
of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased 111 percentage points in
1999 from 1998 the decrease in 1999 resulted from increased sales volumes of
asics and a more profitable product mix especially higher volumes of fiber
optic communications products motion control devices and microprocessors

     operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 22 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 10 percentage point in 1999 from 1998
the increase in 2000 was primarily due to infrastructure costs related to
operating on our own and increased research and development costs the decrease
in 1999 was primarily the result of higher net revenue

     research and development expenses increased 379 percent in 2000 from 1999
and 105 percent in 1999 from 1998 the increases in both years reflect
increased development in the fiber optics highspeed networking and image and
position sensor products selling general and administrative expenses increased
425 percent in 2000 and were unchanged in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000
was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own
as well as higher selling and marketing costs including branding expenses

     in the first quarter of 2001 we announced an agreement to sell our
healthcare solutions business to philips see overview section of the mda this
sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other closing
conditions

net revenue

     net revenue from our healthcare solutions business decreased 59 percent to
14 billion in 2000 from 1999 and increased 120 percent to 15 billion in
1999 from 1998 the decrease in 2000 was primarily due to a slowdown in capital
expenditures by us hospitals and increased discounts in addition lower
volumes and an unfavorable currency impact in europe contributed to the decline
also some of our customers accelerated purchases into 1999 to avoid potential
year 2000 issues the increase in 1999 was primarily related to strong sales in
the second half of 1999 from cardiology products and patient monitoring products
partially offset by a decline from ultrasound imaging products in the first
half of 1999 internal production constraints resulting from our transition to a
new enterprise resource planning system contributed to the decline in revenue
from the ultrasound imaging products and also affected the growth rate in
patient monitoring revenue these implementation issues have subsequently been
resolved

earnings loss from operations

     the healthcare solutions business had a loss of 96 million in 2000 as
compared to earnings of 125 million in 1999 and earnings of 62 million in
1998 excluding restructuring charges in 2000 our healthcare solutions business
had a loss of 75 million the decline in earnings in 2000 was due to lower net
revenue as well as higher costs and expenses the increase in 1999 was primarily
due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses

     cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by
54 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 19 percentage points in
1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000 was primarily attributable to lower net
revenue resulting from lower volumes and higher discounts as well as higher
infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own in
addition costs relating to the restructuring and an unfavorable product mix
contributed to this increase the decrease in 1999 was primarily due to lower
overhead lower product installation costs and a more profitable product mix

     operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 98 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 18 percentage points in 1999 from 1998
the increase in 2000 was primarily due to lower net revenue and higher
infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own in
addition expenses relating to restructuring and increased goodwill charges
related to acquisitions in 2000 contributed to the increase in 1999 the
decrease was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses

     research and development expenses increased 101 percent in 2000 from 1999
and increased 70 percent in 1999 from 1998 the increase in 2000 was largely a
result of ongoing development projects including the new automatic external
defibrillator ultrasound imaging and webenabled wireless patient monitoring
devices the 1999 increase was largely a result of our efforts to develop new
automatic external defibrillator products selling general and administrative
expenses increased 211 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 73 percent in 1999 from
1998 in 2000 the increase was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and
branding expenses relating to operating on our own costs related to our
becoming a separate standalone entity including advertising expenses
accounted for approximately half of the increase in 1999 from 1998 in addition
expenses relating to the restructuring and increased goodwill amortization
charges related to 2000 acquisitions contributed to the increase most of the
remainder of the increase in 1999 was due to goodwill amortization charges
associated with the heartstream acquisition in 1998

net revenue

     net revenue from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat at
10 billion in 2000 and 1999 and increased 94 percent to 10 billion in 1999
from 1998 in 2000 revenue growth in our products sold to the pharmaceutical
and life sciences markets was partially offset by weakness in our traditional
chemical and environmental markets new product releases contributed to
increased sales of our liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products
services and other revenue was flat in 2000 from 1999 the net revenue increase
in 1999 was generated by growth across all product lines and included a 145
percent increase in services and other revenue demand within the pharmaceutical
industry was especially strong leading to increased sales of our liquid
chromatography products in addition sales to our customers in asia in the
second half of 1999 increased as economic conditions in the region continued to
improve

earnings from operations

     earnings from operations from our chemical analysis business decreased 786
percent to 24 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 493 percent to 112
million in 1999 from 1998 the decrease in 2000 was primarily due to higher
infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to the costs of operating on
our own as well as planned research and development in life sciences to launch
new products the increase in 1999 was due primarily to higher net revenue
partially offset by higher costs and expenses

     cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by
19 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased by 36 percentage points
in 1999 from 1998 in 2000 the increase was primarily due to lower volumes
startup costs for life sciences products as well as higher infrastructure costs
and branding expenses relating to operating on our own in 1999 the improvement
was related to higher volumes greater manufacturing efficiencies in our mass
spectrometer and liquid chromatography product lines and lower warranty costs
in addition greater efficiency within the service business accounted for 08
percentage points of the improvement

     operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 68 percentage
points in 2000 from 1999 and increased 06 percentage points in 1999 from 1998
in 2000 the increase resulted primarily from increased life sciences research
and development activities higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses
relating to operating on our own the increase in 1999 resulted from greater
growth in expenses than in net revenue

     research and development expenses increased 270 percent in 2000 from 1999
and 139 percent in 1999 from 1998 the increases reflected new product
development programs in the life sciences selling general and administrative
expenses increased 175 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 106 percent in 1999 from
1998 the increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and
branding expenses related to operating on our own in addition the increase in
1999 was primarily due to higher marketing and field selling costs

liquidity and capital resources

     our financial position remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of
996 million at october 31 2000

     prior to november 1 1999 cash receipts associated with our businesses
were transferred to hewlettpackard on a daily basis and hewlettpackard
provided funds to cover our disbursements accordingly we reported no cash or
cash equivalents at october 31 1999 and 1998 in accordance with our separation

                                       39

agreement with hewlettpackard as of november 1 1999 hewlettpackard retained
some of our assets and liabilities and transferred to us some of the assets and
liabilities related to its business in november and december 1999
hewlettpackard made cash payments to us totaling 13 billion to fund our
working capital and other needs of our operations as a separate standalone
entity in addition hewlettpackard transferred approximately 05 billion to
fund our acquisition of yokogawa electric corporations yokagawa 25 minority
interest in agilent technologies japan ltd the net proceeds of our initial
public offering of 21 billion were received in november 1999 and immediately
distributed to hewlettpackard as a dividend

     of the total 18 billion received from hewlettpackard 11 billion was
classified as net cash provided by financing activities and 07 billion was
classified among several categories as net cash provided by operating activities
in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended october 31 2000

     we generated cash from operations of 838 million in 2000 compared to 461
million in 1999 and 751 million in 1998 in 2000 cash from operations was
primarily a result of net earnings and from the sale of certain portions of our
us portfolio of lease assets to cit in 1999 and 1998 cash from operations
was primarily a result of net earnings adjusted for noncash charges for
depreciation and amortization in addition lower cash from operations in 1999
resulted from a significant increase in accounts receivable due to particularly
strong shipments in october 1999

     net cash used by investing activities was 1117 million in 2000 compared
to 309 million in 1999 and 272 million in 1998 in all periods capital
expenditures for property plant and equipment and business acquisitions
partially offset by proceeds from divestitures and the disposal of excess
unused or retired assets constituted substantially all of our cash used in
investing activities we used 691 million in 2000 to pay for the first and
second installments of the purchase of yokagawas minority interest in agilent
technologies japan ltd and several other companies we expect to purchase the
remaining 42 of agilent technologies japan ltds shares owned by yokogawa
prior to january 31 2001 hewlettpackard provided the funding for the yokogawa
transaction in november 1999

     future sales of our portfolio of lease assets to cit are anticipated during
2001 we are currently negotiating the details of the future sales agreements
the financial impacts are not determinable at this time

     in the first quarter of 2001 we entered into an agreement to sell our
healthcare solutions business to philips for approximately 17 billion

     on january 5 2001 we acquired osi for approximately 684 million in cash
cash for this transaction was provided by cash on hand as well as proceeds of
our commercial paper and other shortterm borrowing under our existing credit
facilities

     our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the
normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from
fluctuations related to global economies and markets we believe that cash
generated from operations and our unused lines of credit will be sufficient to
satisfy our working capital capital expenditure and research and development
funding requirements for the foreseeable future however we may require or
choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future we cannot
assure that additional financing if needed will be available on favorable
terms

factors that may affect future results

if we do not introduce new products and services in a timely manner our
products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will
suffer

     we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid
technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and
evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products
services and enhancements our products and services will likely become
technologically obsolete

                                       40
page   43

over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the
success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors
including our ability to

      properly identify customer needs

      price our products competitively

      innovate and develop new technologies and applications

      successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner

      manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time and

      differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings

     many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and
manufacture their new products we therefore must anticipate industry trends and
develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products
development of new products generally requires a substantial investment before
we can determine the commercial viability of these innovations our other
businesses will encounter similar challenges we would suffer competitive harm
if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products
and technologies that do not achieve broad market acceptance

if demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity our
earnings may suffer

     demand for our products has put increased pressure on our manufacturing
capacity especially in the wireless and fiber optic areas if we are not able
to increase our manufacturing capacity in the time necessary to meet demand if
we experience difficulties in obtaining parts or components needed for
manufacturing or if demand exceeds our expectations we may experience
insufficient manufacturing capacity if our manufacturing capacity does not keep
pace with product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely
manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall
business conversely if demand for our products decreases the fixed costs
associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our earnings

failure of suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely
manner could adversely impact our operations

     certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited
number of suppliers in addition suppliers may cease manufacturing certain
components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of
our products suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase
prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our results may be
materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet
our requirements in a timely manner

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and
operations particularly in korea and japan could adversely affect our sales

     since we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks
associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from
international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our
total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers
are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be
harmed by a variety of factors including

      changes in foreign currency exchange rates

      changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic
       conditions particularly in emerging markets

      trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

      potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws

                                       41
page   44

      difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations

      differing labor regulations

      differing protection of intellectual property and

      unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

     we do a portion of our businesses in korea and japan which have been
subject to increased economic instability in recent years our businesses
declined in 1998 when korea and japan experienced economic difficulties the
recurrence of weakness in these economies or weakness in other international
economies could have a significant negative effect on our future operating
results

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to
decline

     given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably
predict future revenue and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to
adjust our operations a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to
our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus
relatively small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our
operating results in a quarter for example when our revenue declined in the
second half of 1998 as a result of the financial crisis in asia it caused
significant negative fluctuations in our operating results

     other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include

      demand for and market acceptance of our products

      competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices

      adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states
       and other major regions in which we do business

      adverse changes in industries such as semiconductors and electronics on
       which we are particularly dependent

      changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various
       products and customers

      unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products

      our competitors announcements of new products services or technological
       innovations

      increased costs of raw materials or supplies

      changes in the timing of product orders and

      our inability to forecast revenue in a given quarter from large system
       sales

the current technology labor market is very competitive and our businesses will
suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient personnel

     our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key
research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and
administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of
these personnel we will not be able to maintain and expand our businesses
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense and we
operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly
competitive including the silicon valley region of northern california where
our headquarters and central research and development laboratories are located
although we believe we offer competitive salaries and benefits certain of our
businesses have had to increase spending in order to retain personnel

our operating results could be harmed if the industries into which we sell our
products are in downward cycles

     several significant industries and markets into which we sell our products
are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions for example in
1998 the operating results of our test and measurement and
                                       42
page   45

semiconductor products businesses were harmed by downturns in the semiconductor
market from time to time the electronics industry has also experienced
significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing
product cycles and declines in general economic conditions in addition we are
starting to see a softening in portions of the telecommunications industry and
the computer industry the computer industry is also subject to seasonal and
cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products these industry downturns have
been characterized by diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity
and the subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices any
significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions
would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and
could harm our businesses

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may
result in financial results that are different than expected we may not be able
to successfully integrate the companies we acquire and our efforts may divert
attention from other business operations

     in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with
third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint
ventures and divestitures although completion of any one transaction may not
have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash
flows taken as a whole our financial results may differ from the investment
communitys expectations in a given quarter divestiture of a part of our
business may result in the cancellation of orders and charges to earnings
acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate with a
different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may
also have to develop manufacture and market products with our products in a way
that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful
integration of the entity into agilent depends on a variety of factors
including

      the hiring and retention of key employees

      management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

      the integration or coordination of different research and development and
       product manufacturing facilities

     all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which
may divert our attention from other business operations

our semiconductor technology licensing and supply arrangements with
hewlettpackard limit our ability to sell to other companies and could restrict
our ability to expand our businesses

     we do not have a license under hewlettpackards patents patent
applications and invention disclosures for with some exceptions inkjet
products printer products including printer supplies accessories and
components document scanners and computing products in addition our icbd
technology ownership and license agreement which generally covers integrated
circuit technology that is used in integrated circuits for hewlettpackards
printers scanners and computers provides that for a period of three years in
some cases and 10 years in other cases we are prohibited with some exceptions
from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of
integrated circuits for use in inkjet products printer products including
printer supplies accessories and components document scanners and computing
products to third parties other than hewlettpackard

     although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to
hewlettpackard of these kinds of integrated circuits the supply agreement does
not require hewlettpackard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us in
the event that hewlettpackard reduces its purchase of our integrated circuits
we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of
integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers

                                       43
page   46

if demand for hewlettpackards printer workstation and server products
declines or if hewlettpackard chooses a different supplier our semiconductor
products business revenue will decline significantly

     historically our semiconductor products business has sold products to
hewlettpackard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of
hewlettpackard for 2000 hewlettpackard accounted for 65 of our total net
revenue and 303 of our semiconductor products business net revenue
respectively in comparison for 1999 hewlettpackard accounted for 100 of
our total net revenue and 370 of our semiconductor products business net
revenue respectively for 1998 hewlettpackard accounted for 88 of our total
net revenue and 345 of our semiconductor products business net revenue
respectively

our ability to compete for hewlettpackards business may suffer as a result of
our separation due to decreased access to hewlettpackards research and
development strategy technology plans future product features and product
supply needs

     in the past we have benefited from our access to hewlettpackards
research and development strategy technology plans future product features and
product supply needs in competing for hewlettpackards business if our
competitors were to gain better access to hewlettpackard as a result of our
separation our competitors may be able to develop products that better meet the
future needs of hewlettpackard decreasing the competitiveness of our products
in addition we have taken advantage of collaborative relationships with some of
hewlettpackards businesses and we may not continue to enjoy all of the
benefits of these collaborative relationships

we may face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations in
the manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals and if we fail to
comply we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or be prohibited from
distributing our products

     some of our chemical analysis business products are used in conjunction
with chemicals whose manufacture processing and distribution are regulated by
the united states environmental protection agency under the toxic substances
control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to
the toxic substances control act we must conform the manufacture processing
and distribution of these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory
requirements in all countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply
with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then
we could be made to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some
cases be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the
products or component substances are brought into compliance

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may
be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and
we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties

     the medical device products produced by our healthcare solutions business
are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration
fda and similar international agencies their regulations govern a wide
variety of product activities from design and development to labeling
manufacturing promotion sales and distribution in the first quarter of 2001
we announced a definitive agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to
philips the sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other
closing conditions

     in addition our chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and
production processes to test compliance with the toxic substances control act
the federal food drug and cosmetic act and similar regulations therefore we
must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to
unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and
value of the properties involved

     some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard for
known subsurface contamination hewlettpackard has agreed to retain the
liability for all known subsurface contamination perform the required
remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that
contamination the determination of the existence and cost of any additional
contamination caused by us could involve costly and
                                       44
page   47

timeconsuming negotiations and litigation in addition hewlettpackard will
have access to our properties to perform remediation while hewlettpackard has
agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at those properties
remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur
unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and
value of the properties we cannot assure you that hewlettpackard will fulfill
its indemnification or remediation obligations

     we are indemnifying hewlettpackard for any liability associated with
contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from
hewlettpackard to us other than those properties currently undergoing
remediation by hewlettpackard while we are not aware of any material
liabilities associated with existing subsurface contamination at any of those
properties subsurface contamination may exist and we may be exposed to
material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination

environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to
substantial liabilities in the future

     our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of
substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws
governing the environment we may be subject to liabilities for environmental
contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is
to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and
outside the united states even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign
governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to
liability

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and our
failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government
contracts could harm our businesses

     we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government
entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that
apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing
government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for
example many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are
not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for
compliance with the terms of government contracts we have received and are
complying with formal requests for information by the government regarding our
sales of products to some of the government agencies with which we have
contracted these requests may result in legal proceedings against us or
liability which may be significant

we and our customers are subject to various other governmental regulations and
we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop
our products to be compatible with these regulations

     several of our product lines are subject to other significant
international federal state and local health and safety packaging product
content and labor regulations these regulations are complex change frequently
and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur
significant expenses to comply with these regulations or remedy past violations
of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government
regulations could also result in cessation of portions or all of our operations
impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our
operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into
regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing
our products

     our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of
industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as
well as regulation of other agencies such as the united states federal
communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we
fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses will be
harmed

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we
could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from
selling products

     third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property
rights and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid
                                       45

intellectual property rights of third parties we may be unaware of intellectual
property rights of others that may cover some of our technology products and
services moreover in connection with future intellectual property infringement
claims we will only have the benefit of asserting counterclaims based on
hewlettpackards intellectual property portfolio in limited circumstances and
we will only be able to offer licenses to hewlettpackards intellectual
property in order to resolve claims in limited circumstances in addition
although we believe we have all necessary rights to use the new brand name our
rights to use it may be challenged by others

     any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be
costly and timeconsuming and divert our management and key personnel from our
business operations the complexity of the technology involved and the
uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks claims of
intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
royalty or license agreements however we may not be able to obtain royalty or
license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we also may be subject
to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of
our products

     we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our
businesses we cannot assure you that these licenses will be available in the
future on favorable terms or at all in addition our position with respect to
the negotiation of licenses may change as a result of our separation from
hewlettpackard our patent crosslicense agreement with hewlettpackard gives
us a conditional right to sublicense only a portion of hewlettpackards
intellectual property portfolio as a result in negotiating patent
crosslicense agreements with third parties we may be unable to obtain
agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could
sublicense hewlettpackards entire intellectual property portfolio

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may expend
significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury

     our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on
a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets
confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual
property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our
operating results

     our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be
allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or
trademark registrations in addition our patents may not provide us a
significant competitive advantage

     we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our
intellectual property rights we may not be able to detect infringement and may
lose competitive position in the market before we do so in addition
competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign
countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share

if our factories or facilities were to experience catastrophic loss due to
earthquake our operations would be seriously harmed

     several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by
earthquake due to their location we have significant facilities in areas with
above average seismic activity such as our production facilities headquarters
and agilent laboratories in california and our production facilities in
washington and japan if any of these facilities were to experience a
catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments
and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility
agilent selfinsures against such losses and does not carry catastrophic
insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from earthquakes

we currently still use some of hewlettpackards information systems and we are
in the process of developing our own information systems

     we currently use hewlettpackards systems to support a portion of our
operations mainly customer support and networks we have an agreement with
hewlettpackard for hewlettpackard to continue to provide these information
services to us through the end of 2001 during this time period while we are
developing our own systems we will be dependent on hewlettpackard for the
provision of these information technology services that are critical to running
our businesses many of the systems we currently use are proprietary to
hewlettpackard and are very complex

     we are in the process of creating our own information systems to eventually
replace hewlettpackards systems we may not be successful in implementing
these systems and transitioning data from hewlettpackards systems to ours we
are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to
manage some of our information systems

the transitional services being provided to us by hewlettpackard may not be
sufficient to meet our needs and we may pay increased costs to replace these
services after our agreements with hewlettpackard expire

     hewlettpackard has agreed to provide certain transitional services to us
including services related to

      information technology systems

      buildings and facilities and

      administrative services

     these services may not be provided at the same level as when we were part
of hewlettpackard and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits we also
lease and sublease certain office and manufacturing facilities from
hewlettpackard these transitional service and leasing arrangements generally
have a term of less than two years following the separation after the
expiration of these various arrangements we may not be able to replace the
transitional services or enter into appropriate leases in a timely manner or on
terms and conditions including cost as favorable as those we receive from
hewlettpackard

     these agreements were made in the context of a parentsubsidiary
relationship and were negotiated in the overall context of our separation from
hewlettpackard as a result some of these agreements may have terms and
conditions that are less specific than some agreements that are negotiated at
armslength the prices charged to us under these agreements may be different
from the prices that we may be required to pay third parties for similar
services or the costs of similar services if we undertake them ourselves

our historical 1999 and 1998 financial information may not be representative of
our results as a separate company

     the historical 1999 and 1998 financial information we have included has
been carved out from hewlettpackards consolidated financial statements and
does not reflect what our consolidated financial position results of operations
and cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone entity
during the periods presented hewlettpackard did not account for us as and we
were not operated as a single standalone entity for the 1999 and 1998 periods
presented in addition the historical information is not necessarily indicative
of what our results of operations financial position and cash flows will be in
the future we did not make adjustments to reflect the many significant changes
that will occur in our cost structure funding and operations as a result of our
separation from hewlettpackard including changes in our employee base changes
in our tax structure increased costs associated with reduced economies of
scale increased marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand identity
and increased costs associated with being a public standalone company

we may have potential business conflicts of interest with hewlettpackard with
respect to our past and ongoing relationships that could harm our business
operations

     conflicts of interest may arise between hewlettpackard and us in a number
of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships including

      labor tax employee benefit indemnification and other matters arising
       from our separation from hewlettpackard

      intellectual property matters

      employee retention and recruiting

      major business combinations involving us and

      the nature quality and pricing of transitional services hewlettpackard
       has agreed to provide us

     nothing restricts hewlettpackard from competing with us other than some
restrictions on the use of patents licensed to hewlettpackard by us



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

     we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our
sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the united states dollar our exposure to exchange rate
risks has been managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes
derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to
hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains
and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the
derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to
utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

     we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse
movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying
exposures described above as of october 31 2000 and 1999 the analysis
indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material
effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash
flows

                   notes to consolidated financial statements

1 overview and basis of presentation

     agilent technologies inc agilent was incorporated in delaware in may
1999 as a whollyowned subsidiary of hewlettpackard company hewlettpackard
agilent authorized 125000000 shares of 01 par value preferred stock and
2000000000 shares of 01 par value common stock and issued 10000000 shares
of common stock to hewlettpackard no shares of preferred stock were issued and
outstanding

     effective october 21 1999 agilents board of directors declared a
38forone stock split in the form of a stock dividend as of result of the
stock split common stock issued and outstanding increased to 380000000
shares shares outstanding and net earnings per share amounts have been adjusted
for all periods

     on november 18 1999 agilent launched its initial public offering of
72000000 shares of common stock at 30 per share the net proceeds of the
offering of 21 billion were paid to hewlettpackard as a dividend on november
23 1999 on april 7 2000 hewlettpackard announced that its board of
directors had declared a stock dividend of all of hewlettpackards shares in
agilent the dividend was distributed on june 2 2000 the distribution date
to hewlettpackard shareholders of record as of may 2 2000 the distribution
was made on the basis of 03814 of an agilent share for each hewlettpackard
common share outstanding

     agilents fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years
and dates refer to agilents fiscal year

     the consolidated 1999 and 1998 financial information was prepared using
hewlettpackards historical bases in the assets and liabilities and the
historical results of operations of agilent agilent began accumulating retained
earnings on november 1 1999

     the consolidated 1999 and 1998 financial information includes allocations
of certain hewlettpackard corporate expenses including centralized research
and development legal accounting employee benefits real estate insurance
service information technology services treasury and other hewlettpackard
corporate and infrastructure costs the expense allocations were determined on
bases that hewlettpackard and agilent considered to be a reasonable reflection
of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by agilent
therefore the 1999 and 1998 financial information included herein is not
indicative of the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash
flows of agilent in the future or what they would have been had agilent operated
as a separate standalone entity during 1999 and 1998 in 1999 agilent entered
into interim service level agreements with hewlettpackard for information
technology financial accounting building legal and other services see note
14 transactions with hewlettpackard

     effective november 1 1999 agilent began operating as a standalone
company in november 1999 hewlettpackard transferred to agilent a majority of
the assets and liabilities relating to its businesses and also provided agilent
with cash funding of approximately 11 billion hewlettpackard retained some
of agilents assets and liabilities including some of its accounts receivable
and accounts payable accrued payroll and related items and taxes payable
except deferred taxes and transferred to agilent some of the assets and
liabilities related to its business including some of the accounts receivable
accounts payable and other liabilities of agilent technologies japan ltd
formerly called hewlettpackard japan ltd in addition hewlettpackard
transferred to agilent 521 million to fund its acquisition of yokogawa electric
corporations 25 ownership of agilent technologies japan ltd in december
1999 hewlettpackard provided agilent with additional cash funding of
approximately 200 million based on its and hewlettpackards balance sheets as
of october 31 1999

     of the total 18 billion of funding received from hewlettpackard in 2000
11 billion was classified as net cash provided by financing activities and
07 billion was classified among several categories as net cash provided by
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended october 31 2000

2 summary of significant accounting policies

     certain amounts in the consolidated statement of earnings for 1999 and 1998
have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in 2000

     principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of agilent and its wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries all
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated

     use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in agilents consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
actual results could differ from those estimates

     revenue recognition revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and
allowances is recognized at the time the product is shipped or upon
installation and customer acceptance if the acceptance criteria are
substantive provisions are established for estimated costs that may be incurred
for product warranties and postsales support revenue from services including
operating leases is recognized over the contractual period or as services are
rendered and accepted by the customer

     goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill and purchased intangible
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization is
computed using the straightline method over the economic lives of the
respective assets generally three to ten years

     advertising advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to
188 million in 2000 130 million in 1999 and 94 million in 1998

     taxes on earnings income tax expense for 2000 is based on earnings before
taxes prior to june 3 2000 agilents operating results were included in
hewlettpackards consolidated us and state income tax returns and in tax
returns of certain hewlettpackard foreign subsidiaries the provision for taxes
in agilents consolidated financial statements has been determined on a
separatereturn basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts

     net earnings per share basic net earnings per share is computed by
dividing net earnings numerator by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect
of stock options and other employee stock plans diluted net earnings per share
gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding
during the period in computing diluted net earnings per share the average
stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed
to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises

     cash and cash equivalents agilent classifies investments as cash
equivalents if the original maturity of an investment is three months or less
cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair value prior to
2000 hewlettpackard managed cash and cash equivalents on a centralized basis
cash receipts associated with agilents businesses were transferred to
hewlettpackard on a daily basis and hewlettpackard funded agilents
disbursements for this reason agilent had cash balances of zero in previous
years

     fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of certain of the
companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accrued
compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of
their short maturities the fair values of investments are determined using
quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments

     concentration of credit risk agilent sells the majority of its products
through its direct sales force no single customer accounted for 10 or more of
the combined accounts receivable balance at october 31 2000 and 1999 credit
risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the
large number of entities comprising agilents customer base and their dispersion
across many different industries and

                                       f8
page   60
             notes to consolidated financial statements continued

geographies agilent performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
financial condition and requires collateral such as letters of credit and bank
guarantees in certain circumstances

     derivative instruments agilent enters into foreign exchange contracts
primarily forwards and purchased options to hedge exposures to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates these contracts are designated at inception as
hedges of the related foreign currency exposures which include committed and
anticipated foreign currency sales and assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to achieve hedge
accounting contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk
otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply
with established risk management policies hedging contracts generally mature
within six months agilent does not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes

     when hedging salesrelated exposure foreign exchange contract expirations
are set so as to occur in the same month the hedged shipments occur allowing
realized gains and losses on the contracts to be recognized in net revenue in
the same periods in which the related revenues are recognized premiums paid
related to purchased option contracts are amortized to income over the life of
the contract when hedging balance sheet exposure realized gains and losses on
foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income expense net in the
same period as the realized gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities occur discounts or premiums on
forward contracts are amortized to income over the life of the contract the
gains and losses which have not been material are included in cash flows from
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

     inventory inventory is valued at standard cost which approximates actual
cost computed on a firstin firstout basis not in excess of market value

     property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation additions improvements and major renewals
are capitalized maintenance repairs and minor renewals are expensed as
incurred depreciation is provided using accelerated methods principally over
fifteen to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for
machinery and equipment including equipment leased to customers under operating
leases depreciation of leasehold improvements is provided using the
straightline method over the life of the asset or the term of the lease or the
asset whichever is shorter

     impairment of longlived assets agilent continually monitors events and
changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of longlived
assets including intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or
changes in circumstances are present agilent assesses the recoverability of
longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of
the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets agilent
recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over
the fair value of the assets

     foreign currency translation agilent uses the us dollar as its
functional currency foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into
us dollars at current exchange rates except for inventory property plant and
equipment other assets and deferred revenue which are remeasured at historical
exchange rates revenue and expenses are generally translated at average
exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related
to balance sheet amounts that are remeasured at historical exchange rates gains
or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net
earnings in 2000 the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on
agilents cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies was not
material

     recent accounting pronouncements in june 1998 the financial accounting
standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 133 this
statement as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or
liabilities in the balance sheet and

                                       f9

             notes to consolidated financial statements continued

measurement of those instruments at fair value the statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 agilent expects the adoption of fas
133 during first quarter of 2001 will result in a cumulative after tax expense
of 26 million additionally an unrealized gain related to foreign currency
hedging of approximately 7 million net of tax will be recorded in other
comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet

     in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements in
june 2000 the sec delayed the implementation date of this staff accounting
bulletin this staff accounting bulletin is effective no later than the fourth

11 restructuring asset impairment and other charges

     in august 2000 agilent announced a restructuring of its healthcare
solutions business the restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction through
severance programs as well as consolidation of its business operations since
the announcement 396 regular employees located in the united states asia
pacific and europe have accepted severance packages and 200 temporary employees
have been terminated agilent recognized a 21 million pretax restructuring
charge comprised of 13 million for estimated severance benefits and 8 million
for noncash asset writedowns of this amount 11 million was included in cost
of products 4 million in cost of services and other the remainder was
included in other operating expense line items as of october 31 2000 2
million in severance benefits has been paid and charged against the liability
the reminder of the liability is expected to be utilized during 2001

     in 1999 agilent recognized an impairment loss of 51 million related to a
building that was under construction for the intended purpose of housing
manufacturing operations for eightinch cmos semiconductor wafers at the time
construction was stopped only the building shell was complete after exhaustive
efforts to find a semiconductor manufacturing partner to utilize the building
for its initial intended use management concluded that the highest fair value
to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office
or general use facility in 2000 agilent actively marketed the building shell
without success in late 2000 in response to the increased demand in the
wireless semiconductor market and the need to increase gallium arsenide gaas
manufacturing capacity management decided to resume construction of a portion
of the building shell when completed this portion of the building will
manufacture sixinch gaas semiconductor wafers agilent anticipates that the
completed manufacturing facility will be put into service sometime in 2002 at
which time depreciation will commence

     during 1998 agilent recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 163
million related to the transfer of the production of certain semiconductor
wafers to a thirdparty contractor of this amount 138 million was included in
cost of products 7 million in research and development and 18 million in
selling general and administrative expenses included in this charge was 85
million for noncash asset writedowns of equipment that was subsequently
abandoned or sold also included in this charge was 78 million for employee
severance benefits that have been paid

     also during 1998 agilent recorded a pretax charge of 37 million for the
writedown of an investment in convertible preferred stock of a medical products
company to its fair value because management had determined the impairment was
not temporary

12 stock based compensation

     employee stock purchase plans prior to february 2 2000 virtually all
agilent employees were able to contribute up to ten percent of their base
compensation to the quarterly purchase of hewlettpackards common stock under
the hewlettpackard stock purchase plan the legacy plan under the provisions
of the legacy plan employee contributions to purchase shares were partially
matched with shares contributed by hewlettpackard these matching shares
generally vested over two years after february 2 2000 agilent implemented the
agilent employee stock purchase plan the agilent plan that was similar to the
legacy plan and that allowed eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent
of their base compensation to the purchase of agilent common stock under the
provisions of the agilent plan employee contributions were partially matched
with shares contributed by agilent these matching shares also generally vested
over two years on june 2 2000 all unvested matching shares of hewlettpackard
stock held by our employees were forfeited and replaced by similar shares of
agilent common stock compensation expense for the matching

provision for both the legacy plan and the agilent plan was measured using the
fair value of shares on the date of purchase by hewlettpackard for the legacy
plan and by agilent for the agilent plan and was recognized by agilent over the
twoyear vesting period compensation expense under both plans was 38 million
in 2000 44 million in 1999 and 33 million in 1998 amounts from 1999 and 1998
were allocated from hewlettpackard at october 31 2000 9802100 shares of
agilent common stock had been authorized for issuance under the agilent plan and
2748062 of these shares had been issued

     effective october 31 2000 purchases and contributions under the agilent
plan ceased all unvested matching shares under the agilent plan will maintain
their original vesting terms based on the employees continued employment with
agilent vesting of these matching shares will be completed no later than
october 31 2002

     effective november 1 2000 agilent adopted a new plan the agilent
technologies inc employee stock purchase plan new plan under the provisions
of the new plan eligible employees may contribute up to 10 of their base
compensation to purchase shares of agilent common stock at 85 of the lower of
the fair market value at the entry date or purchase date as defined by the new
plan as of november 1 2000 35000000 shares of agilent common stock were
registered for issuance under the new plan

     incentive compensation plans prior to november 1999 certain of agilents
employees participated in hewlettpackards stockbased incentive compensation
plans under which they received stock options and other equity based awards on
september 17 1999 agilent adopted the agilent technologies inc 1999 stock
plan the agilent stock plan and subsequently reserved 67800000 shares of
agilent common stock for issuance under the plan stock options stock
appreciation rights stock awards and cash awards may be granted under the
agilent stock plan options granted under the agilent stock plan may be either
incentive stock options as defined in section 422 of the internal revenue
code or nonstatutory options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year
over a period of four years from the date of grant the exercise price for
incentive stock options may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market
value of the underlying agilent stock on the date the stock award is granted

     effective june 2000 a majority of the hewlettpackard awards held by
agilent employees were converted to agilent awards of equivalent value the
conversion of hewlettpackard options into agilent options was done in such a
manner that 1 the aggregate intrinsic value of the options immediately before
and after the exchange is the same 2 the ratio of the exercise price per
option to the market value per option is not reduced and 3 the vesting
provisions and options period of the replacement agilent options are the same as
the original vesting terms and option period of the hewlettpackard options

     at october 31 2000 shares available for option and restricted stock
grants were 40000870 in 2000 discounted options totaling 27300 shares were
granted another 2138649 discounted options were granted as a result of the
conversion of hewlettpackard awards held by agilent employees the stock based
compensation expense related to agilent employees discounted options stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock was 24 million in 2000 and was not
material in 1999 and 1998 amounts for 1999 and 1998 were allocated from
hewlettpackard

     pro forma information agilent has elected to follow the accounting
provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock
issued to employees for stockbased compensation granted to agilent employees

     for purposes of pro forma disclosures the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the fouryear average vesting period of the
options the pro forma effect of recognizing compensation expense in accordance
with sfas no 123 would have been to reduce agilents reported net earnings by
281 million in 2000 38 million in 1999 and 20 million in 1998 had
compensation expense been recorded by agilent in accordance with sfas no 123
the effect would have been to reduce basic net earnings per share by 063 and
diluted net earnings per share by 062 in 2000 in comparison the effect would
have been to reduce both basic and diluted net earnings per share by 010 and
005 in 1999 and 1998 respectively these pro forma amounts include amortized
fair values attributable to options granted after october 31 1995 only and
therefore are not representative of future pro forma amounts

measurement semiconductor products healthcare solutions and chemical analysis
each of which comprises a reportable segment the segments were determined based
primarily on how management views and evaluates agilents operations other
factors including customer base homogeneity of products technology and
delivery channels were also considered in determining agilents reportable
segments agilent measures segment performance based on earnings from
operations

     segment revenue and profit the accounting policies used to derive
reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in note 2
summary of significant accounting policies internal revenue and earnings from
operations include transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an
arms length transfer at the best price available for comparable external
customers

     a significant portion of the segments expenses arise from shared services
and infrastructure that agilent hewlettpackard for 1999 and 1998 has
historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and
to efficiently use resources these expenses include costs of centralized
research and development legal accounting employee benefits real estate
insurance services information technology services treasury and other agilent
corporate hewlettpackard in 1999 and 1998 and infrastructure costs these
expenses are allocated to the segments and the allocations have been determined
on bases that agilent considered to be a reasonable reflection of the
utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments a
different result could be arrived at for any segment if costs were specifically
identified to each segment

     the following tables reflect the results of agilents reportable segments
under agilents management system these results are not necessarily a depiction
that is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the performance of each segment is measured based on
several metrics including earnings from operations these results are used in
part by management in evaluating the performance of and in allocating
resources to each of the segments
