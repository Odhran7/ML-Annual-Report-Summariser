large global partner  we believe there is an important advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo and in vitro services and manufacturing solutions on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work they frequently chose to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the nonclinical drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals provision of data in sponsorspecific formats for data warehousing needs accelerated reporting reduced standard reporting timelines and industryleading standard exchange of nonclinical data send capabilities a global footprint streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

our clients’ rd needs continue to evolve these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes the success of our business model is underscored by the fact that we have entered into strategic commercial relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies we also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio 

we believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess their core differentiators from rd to commercialization and which aspects of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes they will choose to outsource we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as larger pharmaceutical clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure by partnering with a cro like charles river they can take advantage of efficiencies in their earlystage research activities that can result in months or years saved in getting a drug to market in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical rd business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

charles river laboratories international inc 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic commercial partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for multiple years and drive pullthrough across our portfolio furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship because of this strategy we have been successfully renewing the majority of our strategic commercial partnerships 

the evolving biopharmaceutical rd business model coupled with a robust funding environment have also led to the emergence of a significant number of new biotechnology companies in recent years that are discovering innovative new therapies we believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff 

our strategic imperatives are centered around our intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth enhance our operating efficiency and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment which we believe will collectively enable us to maximize value for our shareholders 

in recent years we have expanded our biologics solutions services into the established highgrowth market of cell and gene therapy our goal is to deliver the fastest and highest quality endtoend integrated solution to accelerate cell and gene therapy development and manufacturing globally by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio with a consistent easytouse and customizable highscience approach while offering the flexibility to adapt and innovate to meet our client’s changing needs in the cell and gene therapy market we aim to accelerate our clients’ path to market to expand capabilities and geographic reach to complement our leading nonclinical portfolio and to collaborate with our clients and partners to enable and commercialize the next generation of cell and gene therapy innovations the acquisitions of cognate and vigene combined with our comprehensive portfolio most notably our biologics testing solutions business industry experience and established infrastructure helped solidify the company as a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development testing and manufacturing 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and nonclinical development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions such as our acquisitions of citoxlab in fiscal 2019 hemacare and cellero in fiscal 2020 and distributed bio retrogenix cognate and vigene in fiscal 2021 are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital 

in addition to conventional mergers and acquisitions our longterm strategy includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broadbased portfolio of products and services in particular our focus has been to drive differentiation through technologies that enhance the speed to develop a clinical candidate and allow biopharmaceutical companies to make earlier gonogo decisions among other arrangements these relationships may include entering into license agreements strategic technology partnerships or joint ventures that will allow us to access cuttingedge or nascent technologies with a modest investment component our ability to thoroughly assess these technologies and market opportunities may later result in an acquisition 

we also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on earlystage companies through these partnerships and close relationships we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery safety assessment and biologics testing thus we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

clients 

our clients consist primarily of major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and industrial chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2021 no single commercial client accounted for more than 4 of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 8 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our non 

charles river laboratories international inc 

clinical portfolio because of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients’ planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada asia pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was approximately 266 million 24 billion and 136 million respectively as of december 25 2021 as compared to 168 million 14 billion and 79 million respectively as of december 26 2020 related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client’s intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in december 25 2021 backlog may be completed in 2022 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty 

charles river laboratories international inc 

payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in many distinct regional environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens bred for use in research as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as europe china and japan for the care handling and use of regulated species and birds bred for research with the exception of one facility acquired as part of the cellero acquisition that does not utilize animal research models our dsa and rms facilities in north america and europe are either accredited or in the process of initiating accreditation by association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the scientific operational and quality process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity under newly issued guidance we have established a formal program to manage regulatory and client expectations regarding data integrity within our regulated businesses although each business has a different impact on patient safety all are expected to generate data with integrity we recognize the importance of generating quality reliable sustainable data and have instituted several processes and established a global governance team with oversight responsibilities for our data integrity compliance plans to ensure we are consistent in our approach to ensure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

at a global level retention of data and controls for electronic systems proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies we also have controls in place such as quality manuals policies and procedures work instructions document control processes training quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel validated computerized systems and archiving requirements within businesses procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs and to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable furthermore our comprehensive cell and gene therapy manufacturing services include gmp production of cells from preclinical to commercial applications from a variety of starting materials these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our 

charles river laboratories international inc 

products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation as appropriate under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

• the surface and air transportation of chemicals biological reagents and laboratory specimens 

• the handling use storage and disposal of chemicals including narcotics and psychotropic drugs biological reagents laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials 

• the procurement handling use storage and disposal of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products for research purposes 

• the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities and 

• protection of the environment and general public 

global regulatory compliance programs are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance our compliance programs are also managed by global quality systems such as vendor supplier programs quality management systems and global computer system validation within each regulated business we have established quality assurance units qaus responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing our data integrity compliance program ensures that management has proper oversight with qaus of our electronic records inclusive of quality function reviews of our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

while we expect that capital expenditures will be necessary to ensure that our existing sites remain in compliance with government regulations at this point we do not expect these expenditures to materially differ than our historical experience 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and scientificallydriven products and procedures to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our offerings intellectual property rights in the form of knowhow trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and others are important to us and are valuable to our ability to provide significant benefits to our clients steps are taken to protect our intellectual property rights and include the execution of confidentiality agreements and securing registrations in relevant jurisdictions in addition we inlicense technology from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses inlicensing has recently become a larger companywide initiative particularly as we increase our focus on innovative technologies that further diversify and enhance our portfolio

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and expanding the continuation of this outbreak may have and the emergence of other epidemic or pandemic crises could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and expanding and its ultimate scope duration and effects are uncertain this pandemic has and continues to result in and any future epidemic or pandemic crises may potentially result in direct and indirect adverse effects on our industry and customers which in turn has with respect to covid19 and may with respect to future epidemics or crises impact our business results of operations and financial condition further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us effects of the current pandemic have included or may in the future include among others 

• deterioration of worldwide regional or national economic conditions and activity which adversely affects global demand for our products and services 

• disruptions to our operations as a result of the potential health impact on our employees and crew and on the workforces of our customers and business partners 

• temporary andor partial closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers including academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations and thirdparty service providers 

• interruption of the operations of global supply chains and those of our suppliers 

• constraints on international routes for shipment of products and materials impact timelines to support client demands 

• disruptions to our business from or additional costs related to new regulations directives or practices implemented in response to the pandemic such as travel restrictions shelter in placestay in placework from home orders increased inspection regimes hygiene measures such as quarantining and physical distancing or increased implementation of remote working arrangements 

• reduced cash flows and financial condition including potential liquidity constraints 

charles river laboratories international inc 

• reduced access to capital including the ability to refinance any existing obligations as a result of any credit tightening generally or due to declines in global financial markets including to the prices of publiclytraded equity securities of us our peers and of listed companies generally 

• deterioration in the financial condition and prospects of our customers or attempts by customers suppliers or service providers to invoke force majeure contractual clauses or the legal doctrines of impossibility or impracticability or other similar doctrines as a result of delays or other disruptions 

• delays in the commencement of or the suspension or cancellation of client studies and 

• the effects described elsewhere in these risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices including but not limited to health management of employees customers and suppliers management of production inventory supply chain risk management compensation practices and capital expenditure planning we have formed a tiered structure of designated covid19 crisis management teams throughout our organization to identify implement and monitor such actions as required by the dynamic exigencies arising from the pandemic such measures and others may not be sufficient to mitigate all the risks posed by covid19 and our ability to perform critical functions could be materially adversely affected 

although disruption and effects from the covid19 pandemic may be temporary given the dynamic nature of these circumstances and the worldwide nature of our business and operations the duration of any business disruption and the related financial impact to us cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we bear financial risk for contracts that may be terminated or reduced in scope underpriced subject to cost overruns or delayed 

many of our agreements including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

our counterparties including our clients who are competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including the invocation of force majeure clauses or the legal doctrines of impossibility or impracticability or other similar legal doctrines as a result of the covid19 pandemic the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested a client’s decision to forego or terminate a particular study our competitors’ establishment of alternative distribution channels dissatisfaction with our performance under the agreement the loss of funding for the particular research study or general conveniencecounterparty preference if a counterparty terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees however in many cases we are not entitled to any termination fees in the event of a termination cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

furthermore many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses the expansion and ongoing implementation of operational systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including information security assessment and remediation data conversion network and system cutover user training and integration with existing processes or systems incongruities in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including inconsistent practices delayed report andor data shipments missed sales billing errors and accounting errors 

charles river laboratories international inc 

we have in the past experienced and in the future could experience unauthorized access into our information systems 

we operate large and complex information systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such information systems to steal data or disrupt the systems or for financial gain like other companies we have on occasion experienced and will continue to experience threats and incursions to our data and systems including malicious software and viruses phishing business email compromise and social engineering attacks or other cyberattacks the number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time 

while we have taken measures to protect our information systems from intrusion in march 2019 we detected evidence that an unauthorized third party who we believe was well resourced and highly sophisticated accessed certain of our information systems and copied data we worked with a leading cyber security firm to assist in our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities our investigation indicated that the affected information included client information 

in december 2019 we disclosed that we had completed our remediation of the incident identified in march of 2019 while we have implemented additional security safeguards including 

• remediation of the march 2019 incident 

• cooperation with us federal authorities’ investigation into the incident and established an ongoing relationship to better understand the everchanging nature of cybersecurity related threats 

• additional visibility into our network and environment 

• additional monitoring of our environment 

• active threat hunting in our environment 

• enhanced protection for externally facing web applications 

• the addition of multifactor authentication to ingress points 

• the addition of denial of service attack protection and 

• increased network segmentation 

such efforts may not be successful in which case we could suffer significant harm 

further we are at risk of being targeted and we have in the past been victim to business email compromise fraud which results in payments being made to illegitimate bank accounts although these instances have not resulted in our incurring material losses if similar instances occur in the future we may incur such losses 

our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from the studies we conduct in the event the confidentiality of such information is compromised whether by unauthorized access or other breaches we could be exposed to significant harm including termination of customer contracts damage to our customer relationships damage to our reputation and potential legal claims from customers employees and other parties in addition we may face investigations by government regulators and agencies as a result of a breach 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may be adversely impacted 

during the last two decades we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of hemacare cellero distributed bio retrogenix cognate bioservices inc cognate and vigene biosciences inc vigene however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties in achieving business and financial success due to unplanned events such as the covid19 pandemic and the longterm economic impact of the pandemic 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products information technology platforms technologies or preexisting relationships with our clients distributors and suppliers 

charles river laboratories international inc 

• challenges with developing and operating new businesses including those that are materially different from our existing businesses which may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise 

• potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnifications we may obtain from sellers or any insurance we may acquire in connection with transactions 

• loss of key employees 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• a more expansive regulatory environment 

• dilution to earnings or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company dilution to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders 

• differences in foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies 

• new technologies and products may be developed that cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable and 

• disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business technology service or product that may result in litigation expenses and diversion of our management’s attention 

if an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site product line or service offering we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our business to determine whether any divestitures are appropriate such divestitures could involve additional risks other than those listed above including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture and writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line or service offering and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability 

our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients’ discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely if we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy this could negatively impact our future results of operations and market capitalization 

any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions and expanding our service offerings including our expansion into the cdmo business we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

furthermore our strategy assumes a certain degree of capital and capacity growth development factors such as insufficient capital inflation supply chain interruptions inadequate forecasting increases in construction material costs or labor shortages could interfere with the successful execution of our strategy and our ability to timely build infrastructure to satisfy capacity needs and support business growth for additional discussion of our business strategy please see the section above entitled “our strategy” 

charles river laboratories international inc 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely impact our results foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the us could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar resulting in a reduction in the amount of revenue and cash flow and an increase in the amount of expenses that we recognize and causing fluctuations in reported financial results we also carry foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where we conduct business for example certain contracts are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary’s functional currency while our financial results are reported in us dollars the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency during consolidation these results are translated into us dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results moreover as exchange rates vary revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity 

other risks associated with our international business include 

• general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate including implications of the covid19 pandemic 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in us andor foreign tax laws or interpretations and enforcement thereof notably tax regulations issued and tobeissued with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 2017 tax act and the eu antitax avoidance directives i and ii and the creation of the joint chiefs of global tax enforcement 

• potential international conflicts including terrorist acts 

• exchange controls adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the us 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of covid19 pandemic related suspensions of operations work stoppages andor strikes as well as violations of local laws or antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to the covid19 pandemic 

• unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions including those relating to the covid19 pandemic 

• longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 

• potentially reduced protection of our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries and 

• compliance with export controls import requirements and other trade regulations including those relating to certain products of which there is limited supply 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the fcpa which prohibits companies and their thirdparty intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business likewise we are also subject to other international antibribery laws such as the uk bribery act which prohibit companies and their thirdparty intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to commercial parties 

charles river laboratories international inc 

while our employees and thirdparty intermediaries are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and have been and will continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic 

we depend on our customers continued demand and solvency at our facilities for the continued operation of our business while we maintain disaster recovery plans they might not adequately protect us despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events these events including terrorist attack a pandemic including the covid19 pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a disease hurricanes tornadoes fire floods and ice and snow storms could result in damage to and closure of our or our customers’ facilities or the infrastructure on which such facilities rely as described herein the covid19 pandemic has already and may continue to disrupt our operations though the full extent of such impact remains uncertain such disruptions could include significant delays in the shipments of our products reduce our capacity to provide services adversely impact unique manufacturing capabilities result in our customers’ inability to pay for our products or services and ultimately result in the loss of revenue and clients although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our customers could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services that we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and a significant amount are mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders furthermore the habitat of certain animals used for research purposes may be located in or near certain environmentally protected areas or conservation areas activities conducted by us or any of our agents within these areas may be legally challenged and result in similar negative attention and action from environmental protection activists including advocacy for the expansion of environmental restrictions applicable to such areas any negative attention threats acts of vandalism or legal action directed against our animal research or procurement activities or our thirdparty service providers such as our airline carriers or suppliers or that restrict our or their ability to access protected or conservation areas could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

industry risk factors 

a reduction in demand may adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 also affect their rd budgets and consequentially our business as well 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of rd and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on lowering rd costs per drug candidate fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the rd budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services rd budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations including potential drug pricing legislation available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently 

charles river laboratories international inc 

been influencing rd budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

further our research and gmpcompliant cells operations are structured to produce research materials such as blood products based on customers’ existing demand and perceived potential changes in demand for these products sudden or unexpected changes in demand for these products could have an adverse impact on our profitability increasing demand could harm relationships with customers if we are unable to alter production capacity or purchase products from other suppliers to fill orders adequately this could result in a decrease in overall revenue and profits the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 caused us to temporarily suspend blood donations in early 2020 which have since resumed at our research and gmpcompliant cells facilities further limiting our ability to respond to changes in demand lack of access to sufficient capital or lack of adequate time to properly or the failure to adequately respond to changes in demand could result in declining revenue and profits as customers transfer to other suppliers 

furthermore we will have significant business which will materially depend upon the regulatory approval of the products it will manufacture for its contract development and manufacturing organization cdmo customers as such if these customers experience a delay in or failure to receive approval for any of their product candidates or fail to maintain regulatory approval of their products that we develop or manufacture our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected additionally if the food and drug administration or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve of our facilities for the manufacture of a customer product observes significant deficiencies or violations at its facilities or withdraws such approval in the future our customers may choose to identify alternative manufacturing facilities andor relationships which could significantly impact our cdmo capacity and capabilities and results of operations therefrom 

a reduction or delay in government funding of rd may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue predominantly in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast we also sell directly to the nih and these other agencies government funding of rd is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals included reduced allocations to government agencies that fund rd activities government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund rd activities or nih funding may not be directed towards projects and studies that require the use of our products and services both of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results furthermore changes in government budgetary priorities as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 could reduce government funding of rd that is unrelated to the disease which could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply that when interrupted adversely affects our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply from time to time arise from health problems including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the spread of other diseases export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes tariffs inflation international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency geopolitical disputes measures intended to slow the spread of covid19 or other ordinary course or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could materially harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms for example as with other industry participants certain of our activities rely on a sufficient supply of large research models which has seen increasing demand as compared to supply in 2020 and 2021 and into 2022 due to a variety of factors first the surge of research relating to covid19 has increased short term demand second china supplies a significant portion of certain critical large research models which have been subject to geographic export restrictions applicable to many animal species since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic while we continue to take steps to find alternative supply channels and lock in supply with preferred sources through multiyear andor minimum commitment contracts such mitigating efforts may not prove successful at ensuring a steady and timely supply or may require and in the past have required us to pay significantly higher prices for such products during periods of global shortage or restrictions on the transportation of products limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from nonpreferred vendors which may not be successful in addition reductions in global air transportation routes may result in sourcing alternative transportation at an increased cost an inability to obtain a sufficient and timely supply of critical products could adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations 

further portions of our research and gmpcompliant cells business depends on the availability of appropriate donors as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 we temporarily 

charles river laboratories international inc 

suspended blood donations at one of our research and gmpcompliant cells facilities in early 2020 which have since resumed regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply including covid19 could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors or integrity of inventory due to any pandemic epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our research and gmpcompliant cells business operates the portion of the donor pool that typically donates may be unable or unwilling to donate thereby significantly reducing the availability of research products upon which we rely in addition health and healthcare concerns among the public may result in a decline in donations if donor participation declines we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to maintain profitability of the research and gmpcompliant cells business 

our cdmo services establish us as a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development testing and manufacturing enable us to provide clients with an integrated solution from basic research and discovery through cgmp production enable us to drive efficiency and accelerate clients’ speedtomarket by integrating manufacturing and the required testing and enable our clients to seamlessly conduct analytical testing process development and manufacturing for advanced modalities with the same scientific partner 

furthermore our cdmo operations will require various raw materials supplied primarily by third parties we or our customers will specify the raw materials and other items required to manufacture our product and in some cases the customers will specify the suppliers from whom we must purchase these raw materials in certain instances the raw materials and other items may only be supplied by a limited number of suppliers or in limited quantities if thirdparty suppliers do not supply raw materials or other items on a timely basis it may cause a manufacturing run to be delayed or canceled which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

furthermore thirdparty suppliers may fail to provide us with raw materials and other items that meet the qualifications and specifications required by us or our customers if thirdparty suppliers are not able to provide us with raw materials that meet our or our customers’ specifications on a timely basis we may be unable to manufacture our product or it could prevent us from delivering products to our customers within required time frames any such delay in delivering our products may create liability for us to our customers for breach of contract or cause us to experience order cancellations and loss of customers in the event that we manufacture products with components or raw materials that do not meet our qualifications and specifications or those of our customers or governmental or regulatory authorities we may become subject to product liability claims caused by defective raw materials or components from a thirdparty supplier or from a customer 

our cdmo business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance 

if the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance or production volumes of key products that we manufacture for our customers decline financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected for our cdmo business we will depend on and have no control over market acceptance for the products that we will manufacture for our customers consumer demand for these products could be adversely affected by among other things delays in securing regulatory approvals the emergence of competing or alternative products including generic drugs the emergence of new safety data for such products the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights protection reductions in private and government payment product subsidies or changing product marketing strategies 

manufacturing services are highly complex and failure to provide quality and timely services to our cdmo customers could adversely impact our business 

the cdmo services we offer can be highly complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements a failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction viral contamination failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions protocols and standard operating procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors such issues could affect production of a single manufacturing run or manufacturing campaigns requiring the destruction of products or could halt manufacturing operations altogether in addition any failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such incident could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue reimbursement to customers for lost drug substances damage to and possibly termination of customer relationships time and expense spent investigating and remediating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs in addition such issues could subject us to litigation the cost of which could be significant 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses parasites and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain 

charles river laboratories international inc 

service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client’s facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection and liability for damages to infected persons 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification the third party may refuse to fulfill its indemnification obligation or may be unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic contaminations also exists and may require us to restart the applicable colonies and would result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements 

further many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems that are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently influenced outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” above 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete for business with other cros and blood product and therapeutic services companies other cdmos as well as internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

• reputation for ontime quality performance 

• reputation for regulatory compliance 

• expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas 

• scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum 

• scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the manufacturing support spectrum 

• ability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients’ drug discovery nonclinical development and manufacturing support needs 

• broad geographic availability with consistent quality 

• pricevalue spend and flexibility 

charles river laboratories international inc 

• technological and scientific expertise and efficient drug development processes 

• quality of facilities 

• financial stability 

• size 

• ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner and 

• accessibility of client data through secure portals 

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies which are targets for each other and for large pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition our competition in the cdmo market includes fullservice contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering thirdparty manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity also large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future furthermore many of our cdmo competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing technical or other resources than we do moreover additional competition may emerge particularly in lowercost jurisdictions such as india and china which could among other things result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research which could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific community continues to develop cellbased and animal model methods designed to increase the translation from findings in earlystage discovery and preclinical studies to human studies and viceversa as these methods continue to advance they may supplement and in some cases possibly replace or supplant methodologies that are currently in use such as the use of traditional living animals in biomedical research in addition technological improvements such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could impact demand for animal research models further some companies are developing recombinantly produced versions of lal which has been historically derived from live animals it is our strategy to explore new technologies to refine and potentially reduce the use of animal models and animal derived products as new in vitro and in silico methods become available and syntheticallymanufactured products become validated however we may not be able to develop new products inputs or processes effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models inputs or processes with characteristics different from those that we produce and that may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we continue to seek opportunities to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties is critical to our ability to continue to meet the needs of our clients our ability to gain access to such new technologies depends in part on our ability to convince innovators that we can successfully develop and commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients even if we are able to identify these opportunities negotiating license agreements on commercially acceptable terms may prove difficult in addition our ongoing internal research and development efforts may not always yield offerings that meet client demand if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

costs increasing more rapidly than market prices in certain of our businesses could reduce profitability 

the cost of collecting processing and testing blood products has risen significantly in recent years and will likely continue to increase given stringency of demands on raw materials for advanced cell products these cost increases are related to new and improved testing procedures increased regulatory requirements related to blood safety and higher staff and supply costs related to collecting and processing blood products competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating margins some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable sales costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

legal  regulatory risk factors 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning letter from the fda based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for glp or cgmp requirements that are not addressed to the regulatory monitoring authorities’ satisfaction could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines or the temporary closure of our facilities any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in recent years fda has issued guidance that now requires submissions to be presented in a format that conforms with the fda’s send standardization for exchange of nonclinical data standards that apply to our clients’ nda and ind submissions and require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews accordingly our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send notwithstanding some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community noncompliance with any of these expectations could lead to official action by a government authority damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of research animals for research purposes continue to evolve similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our research and gmpcompliant cells business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by federal state and local governments in the us and in the other countries in which it operates this business requires us to obtain many licenses permits authorizations approvals certificates and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate federal state and local regulations change often and new regulations are frequently adopted changes in the regulations could require us to change the way in which we operate our business and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant 

our donor collection centers are registered with the fda and the fda periodically conducts inspections of those facilities and operations at the conclusion of each inspection the fda provides us with a list of observations of regulatory issues discovered during the inspection that could result in additional regulatory action failure to comply with the regulations of the fda could result in sanctions andor remedies and have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping our customers navigate these regulatory processes accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services for example in february 2022 the fda released guidance that is intended to remain in effect through the duration of the covid19 public health emergency the guidance provides biopharmaceutical companies with alternate options for study designs large animal model selection and additional considerations for drug development paradigms 

charles river laboratories international inc 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies including the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures that utilize research animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on rd 

while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level or in laws and regulations in effect in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or have business relationships may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients furthermore modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a materially adverse impact on us our suppliers or our clients 

we are required to comply with stringent complex and evolving laws rules regulations and standards in many jurisdictions as well as contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with stringent complex and evolving laws rules regulations and standards in many jurisdictions as well as contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security ensuring that our collection use transfer storage and other processing of personal information complies with such requirements can increase operating costs impact the development of new products or services and reduce operational efficiency 

internationally virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data privacy and security legal framework with which we must comply for example we are required to comply with the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 and imposes stringent obligations regarding the collection control use sharing disclosure and other processing of personal data additionally following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu we also are subject to the uk general data protection regulation “uk gdpr” ie a version of the gdpr as implemented into uk law failure to comply with the gdpr or the uk gdpr can result in significant fines and other liability including under the gdpr fines of up to eur 20 million or gbp 175 million under the uk gdpr or four percent 4 of global revenue whichever is greater the cost of compliance and the potential for fines and penalties for noncompliance with gdpr and uk gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations recent legal developments in the european economic area eea including recent rulings from the court of justice of the european union and from various eu member state data protection authorities have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states and other socalled third countries outside the eea similar complexities and uncertainties also apply to transfers from the united kingdom to third countries while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us such as implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses sccs the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain moreover on june 4 2021 the european commission adopted new sccs which impose on companies additional obligations relating to personal data transfers out of the eea including the obligation to update internal privacy practices conduct transfer impact assessments and as required to implement additional security measures the new sccs may increase the legal risks and liabilities under eu laws associated with crossborder data transfers and result in material increased compliance and operational costs if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate it could affect the manner in which we provide our services the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations and could adversely affect our financial results while we have implemented new controls and procedures to comply with the requirements of the gdpr uk gdpr and the data privacy and security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate such procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data 

moreover on august 20 2021 china adopted the personal information protection law pipl which went into effect on november 1 2021 and established new national privacy requirements relating to the collection processing transfer and security of personal information in or from china the pipl imposes significant potential penalties for violations including fines of up to rmb 50 million or five percent 5 of annual turnover civil and criminal liability and potential revocation of 

charles river laboratories international inc 

business licensure given the newness of the pipl substantial uncertainty exists with respect to its application and enforcement in the event that the pipl requires us to store data in china or limits our ability to transfer data across borders we may experience increased costs and business inefficiencies fines corrective actions or other penalties asserted due to alleged noncompliance may impose additional financial or operational costs limit our ability to attract and retain local talent or limit our ability to do business in china 

in the united states there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws rules and regulations governing the collection use disclosure retention security transfer storage and other processing of personal information including federal and state data privacy laws data breach notification laws and data disposal laws for example at the federal level we are subject the regulations of the federal trade commission which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security if our public statements about our use collection disclosure and other processing of personal information whether made through our privacy policies information provided on our website press statements or otherwise are alleged to be deceptive unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action including by the federal trade commission or applicable state attorneys general if we are found to have violated applicable laws or regulations we may also be subject to penalties fines damages injunctions or other outcomes that may adversely affect our operations and financial results the united states congress also has considered and may in the future consider various proposals from time to time for comprehensive federal data privacy legislation to which we may become subject if passed and which may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

at the state level we are subject to laws and regulations like the california consumer privacy act ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa creates transparency requirements for companies and grants california residents various new rights with regard to their personal information failure to comply with the ccpa may result in among other things significant civil penalties and injunctive relief or potential statutory or actual damages the ccpa also provides private right of action for data breaches that result in the loss of personal information which is expected to increase data breach litigation in addition in november 2020 california voters approved the california privacy rights act cpra which modifies the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in california including granting additional privacy rights to consumers and creating a new state privacy regulator to implement and enforce the ccpa and cpra while the cpra will not take effect in most material respects until january 1 2023 it may impact our business activities and require compliance costs that adversely affect business operating results prospects and financial condition numerous other states including virginia and colorado have also enacted or are in the process of enacting or considering comprehensive statelevel data privacy and security laws rules and regulations these state statutes and other similar state or federal laws that may be enacted in the future may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies incur substantial compliancerelated costs and expenses and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business 

additionally while collecting research products from donors we may collect use disclose maintain and transmit donor information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure storage transmission or confidentiality of patientidentifiable health information 

we have made changes to and investments in our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate changes to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex laws rules regulations and standards any actual or perceived failure to comply with any such laws rules regulations standards or contractual obligations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business significant fines civil or criminal penalties costly litigation including class actions government investigation or inquiries enforcement actions claims proceedings judgements awards penalties sanctions or other adverse impacts that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to comply with us state local or international environmental health and safety laws and regulations including regulations issued by the occupational safety and health administration environmental protection agency nuclear regulatory agency and department of transportation could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure and have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

we are subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety including laws and regulations relating to the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees and protecting employees from the spread of covid19 failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties andor other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our supplier or result in liability to us in addition compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us that may be costly 

charles river laboratories international inc 

changes in us and international tax law or material changes in our stock price could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate 

in 2017 significant us tax law changes from the 2017 tax act went into effect there remain certain provisions enacted as part of the 2017 tax act which still require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue service irs and treasury department in 2021 us proposed legislation continued to be introduced if enacted these or other changes in us tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows 

additionally the oecd the european commission ec and individual taxing jurisdictions have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational enterprises in 2015 the oecd released its final reports for reform of the international tax system meant to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany luxembourg netherlands and the uk in addition the oecd and ec and individual countries are examining how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy the proposed solutions are designed to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum tax rate of 15 and will reallocate profit of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises worldwide future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from enacted laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we receive substantial tax credits and incentives in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments china france the uk and the us any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits and incentives or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flows and effective tax rate 

further we generally receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options by employees or the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units held by employees the stock price timing and amount of the vesting and exercising of sharebased compensation could adversely impact our effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

• risks associated with errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in nonclinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing 

• risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients’ property such as research models and samples study compounds records work in progress other archived materials or goods and materials in transit while in our possession 

• risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to them or humans despite preventive measures for the quarantine and handling of imported animals 

• risks that we may have errors and omissions andor product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices injectable drugs food beverages and home and beauty products primarily through our microbial solutions business or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our biologics business which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials 

• risk of transmitting dangerous infectious diseases as a result of the failure of our screening and testing processes or new pathogens that may be undetected by such processes and 

• the acquisitions of cognate and vigene in 2021 have expanded our business into the cdmo market which entails additional risks of liability including potential product liability claims errors and omissions claims in connection with our services and potential liability under indemnification agreements between us and our officers and directors 

while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our research and gmpcompliant cells dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks through the negotiation of contractual risk transfer provisions such as indemnification provisions limitations of liability and client insurance requirements 

charles river laboratories international inc 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore either we or a party required to indemnify us may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

the failure to successfully obtain maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against assertions of thirdparties to intellectual property rights could adversely affect us 

many of our services products and processes rely on intellectual property in some cases that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to us sometimes exclusively to protect our intellectual property rights we primarily rely upon trade secret patent and copyright law as well as contractual provisions relating to intellectual property ownership and control and confidentiality laws relating to intellectual property rights and contracts vary from country to country and are subject to change at any time in addition the agreements upon which we rely to protect our intellectual property might be breached or might not be fully enforceable our intellectual property rights might not prevent our competitors from independently developing intellectual property that is similar to or duplicative of ours also enforcement of our intellectual property rights may also require substantial investments of time money and oversight and may not result in success if we are unable to secure and maintain our intellectual property rights or if we are unable to prevent misappropriation or infringement our business could be adversely affected 

furthermore we respect thirdparty intellectual property rights and make efforts to avoid violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights and seek to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that we seek to use in some cases we are asked to utilize components and processes that are provided to us by our clients 

customers of cognate and vigene which we acquired in 2021 for example may utilize intellectual property for the production of their products the manufacture of which has been contracted to us failure by us andor our customers to secure and maintain rights to thirdparty intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect including reduced revenue as a result in a delay or cancellation of the manufacture of products and involvement in judicial and administrative proceedings in which we are named as a party 

further the drug discovery drug development and drug manufacturing industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue litigation can be expensive time consuming and can divert management’s attention from other business concerns if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we may be compelled by a court to pay substantial damages including treble damages and be ordered to stop the challenged activity or obtain a license on unnegotiated andor unfavorable terms 

our bylaws designate the state courts located in the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions including derivative actions which could limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers other employees or the companys stockholders and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company 2 any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company’s stockholders 3 any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or the company’s certificate of incorporation or the company’s bylaws in each case as they may be amended from time to time or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware however this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought under the federal securities laws for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business and financial condition furthermore although we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims

labor  employment risk factors 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer and president since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades while we entered into an amended employment agreement with mr foster in 2021 most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements except in jurisdictions outside of the united states where employment contracts are common for most employees if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process that identifies successors and potential talent needs there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our team members 

our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils employee representative groups andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees if we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor organizations we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

financial and accounting risk factors 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

as of december 25 2021 we had 27 billion of debt and finance leases debt our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions for additional information regarding our debt please see note 9 “longterm debt and finance lease obligations” included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the interest rate on our credit facility credit facility which matures in fiscal year 2026 is linked to libor for usd denominated borrowings estr for eur denominated borrowings and sonia for gbp denominated borrowings as of december 25 2021 amounts outstanding on our credit facility were 12 billion on our revolving credit facility for which there is an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 30 billion disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity in 2017 the financial conduct authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark and it is currently anticipated that libor will be completely phased out by june 30 2023 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after june 30 2023 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop if libor ceases to exist the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our debt in the future may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity while we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phaseout or replacement of libor such as replacing libor with sonia as the base rate for gbp denominated borrowings in our credit facility as of april 2021 however further efforts taken to mitigate the impact of the libor phaseout or replacement of libor may not prove successful in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity

impairment of long lived tangible assets and intangible assets such as goodwill and other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 could among other things impact the discount rate other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets as well as longlived tangible assets such as property plant and equipment and operating lease rightofuse assets should the covid19 pandemic have a prolonged impact on our industry triggering events may arise resulting in longlived tangible asset intangible asset or goodwill impairments to the extent longlived tangible assets intangible assets or goodwill are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our net income such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 25 2021 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was 38 billion property plant and equipment was 13 billion and operating lease rightofuse assets was 293 million 

general risk factors 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by the risks discussed above as well as changes in the general global economy changes in the mix of our products and services cyclical buying patterns of our clients the financial performance of our venture capital investments and the occasional extra week “53rd week” that we recognize in a fiscal year and fourth fiscal quarter thereof due to our fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

covid19 

overview 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and its ultimate scope duration and effects are uncertain this pandemic has and continues to result in and any future epidemic or pandemic crises may potentially result in direct and indirect adverse effects on our industry and customers which in turn has with respect to covid19 and may with respect to future epidemics or crises impact our business results of operations and financial condition further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results refer to item 1a “risk factors” included herein for risk factors reflecting the impact of the covid19 pandemic giving consideration to each of these risk factors the following 

charles river laboratories international inc 

is our current estimate and belief of the impact of the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2021 and how it may continue to affect us in subsequent periods 

business continuity 

to date we generally have not experienced significant challenges in implementing our business continuity plans all of our operating sites remain open and adequately staffed as of the date of this annual report for certain operations or sites experiencing logistical delays we have experienced some inefficiencies as it relates to completing work or fulfilling orders however we do not believe material expenditures will be required or material resource constraints will occur logistical delays include a small number of sites that have experienced reduced operations including as a result of increased employee absenteeism or voluntarily closed as well as delays in transportation activities we have comprehensive business continuity plans in place for each site globally and are continuously updating these to address the evolving covid19 pandemic situation we have continuously refined our plans as the virus has spread and have encouraged and expressed our expectations that employees work remotely whenever possible we are adhering to guidelines from government health and other regulatory agencies for those employees who need to come into our sites to fulfill their responsibilities due to the nature of our business many employees already work in biosecure environments that require personal protective equipment ppe and adhere to other procedures to safely accomplish their daily responsibilities accordingly to date we believe we have been able to efficiently implement the additional safety precautions 

supply chain 

we are focused on ensuring that we have adequate inventory and supplies on hand given the potential disruption of the covid19 pandemic to our suppliers and their supply chain accordingly we have and expect to continue to increase inventory and supplies in 2022 we continuously engage with our suppliers to limit any potential disruption to our supply chain however notwithstanding generally successful efforts to maintain supply chain continuity we have experienced increased costs and delays throughout our supply chain during the pandemic 

financial condition and results of our global operations 

we are a global company that operates in over 110 locations and in over 20 countries worldwide as we perform business across various borders we are experiencing a continuum of impacts in each location as the covid19 pandemic has impacted the global economy in different phases we are continuing to see demand for products and services across all of our businesses although as described below within results of operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the level of demand varies with our different businesses while there is uncertainty our clients are still in need of the products and services we provide to biomedical research to advance discovery and develop new therapies for the treatment of disease including the covid19 pandemic due to certain restrictions in place at the various sites of our clients and suppliers including client and supplier site closures there have been challenges relating to timely receiving and shipping products globally in all businesses should these restrictions continue demandsupply issues may persist and could impact revenue growth operating income including operating income margins and cash flows we have observed some impact due to constraints from internal site restrictions remote work resources and productivity however we believe the impact to us has not been as significant as to companies in many other industries because of the nature of our businesses the classification of our businesses as essential or critical as the case may be and our business continuity plans 

recoverability andor impairment of assets 

the covid19 pandemic did not and is not expected to impact the ability to timely account for assets on our balance sheet there are judgments involved as it relates to reviewing our allowance for credit losses valuation of inventory and valuationsrecovery of investments we believe we have the necessary support for estimates derived for these account balances we have reviewed the collectability and valuation of the assets through the date of financial statement issuance noting no significant recoverability concerns or any impairments identified we did not identify any triggering events when reviewing impairment indicators for our goodwill and longlived assets tangible and intangible that would indicate an impairment may exist should a prolonged disruption occur where there is a material change from our current expectation of future cash flows we could experience additional writeoffs of client receivables or impairments to certain asset balances due to collectability and valuation issues review of impairment indicators and quantifying any impact will continue to be a focus throughout fiscal year 2022 

internal controls over financial reporting in a remote work environment 

internal controls over financial reporting are a focus for us to ensure they continue to be designed and operating effectively as of december 25 2021 and through the issuance of these financial statements we did not have any material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting for personnel responsible for internal control activities and working remote the ability to work effectively enabled us to continue to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting system and efficiency programs implemented in recent years as well as those implemented as part of business continuity plans have enabled us to effectively complete our financial reporting process in a similar way we completed it prior to the covid19 

charles river laboratories international inc 

pandemic despite a largely remote working environment although there is uncertainty over the duration of the covid19 pandemic disruption we do not anticipate any adverse impact to relevant systems or to the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting

business trends 

the covid19 pandemic continued in 2021 but the global economy endured the challenges of the pandemic and recovered as did biopharmaceutical research activity our ability to continue to deliver our leading suite of research and nonclinical development solutions has endeavored our clients to increasingly choose to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions broad scientific capabilities and global scale as well as our resilience throughout the pandemic most of our businesses rebounded from the impact of the covid19 pandemic by early 2021 subsequently resulting in unprecedented client demand throughout the year the strength of the demand environment was further reinforced by strong biotech funding and continued scientific innovation resulting in robust revenue growth across all three of our reportable segments in fiscal year 2021 

many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients intensified their use of strategic outsourcing during 2021 to move their earlystage research programs forward in an efficient and costeffective manner small and midsize biotechnology clients continued to be the primary driver of revenue growth as these clients benefited from the sustained strength of the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2021 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital as well as the enhanced global focus on scientific innovation and emphasized greater investment in their preclinical pipelines many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros like us and biotechnology companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market clients continue to seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us which is leading to new business opportunities as clients adopt more flexible and efficient research and development models 

our dsa reportable segment continued to benefit from these trends in fiscal year 2021 robust safety assessment revenue growth was primarily driven by unprecedented client demand and increased pricing which was supported by record backlog levels we believe the acquisitions of citoxlab 2019 mpi research 2018 and wil research 2016 have solidified our scientific capabilities and global scale and the breadth and depth of our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us as biotechnology funding remains robust and our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research to bring innovative new therapies to market they are evaluating outsourcing more of their research programs such as discovery services we continued to enhance our discovery services capabilities to provide clients with a comprehensive portfolio that enables them to start working with us at the earliest stages of the discovery process we have accomplished this through acquisitions including retrogenix and distributed bio in fiscal year 2021 citoxlab’s discovery services kws biotest in 2018 and brains online in 2017 and through adding cuttingedge capabilities to our discovery toolkit through partnerships such as bitbio cypre fios genomics and most recently discovery artificial intelligence ai partners valence discovery and valo in fiscal year 2021 demand in our discovery services business also increased significantly as our efforts to enhance our scientific capabilities provide clients with flexible partnering models and become a trusted scientific partner for our clients’ earlystage programs have been successful 

overall demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities intensified in fiscal year 2021 demand for our microbial solutions significantly rebounded in fiscal year 2021 from last year’s covid19 restrictions that limited access to certain client sites and the business completed the delayed instrument installations demand for our biologics solutions business continued to meaningfully accelerate driven by our analytical testing services to address the rapidly growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market including cell and gene therapies and covid19 therapeutics in 2021 we continued to enhance our biologics solutions portfolio with the acquisitions of cognate march 2021 and vigene june 2021 to expand our scientific capabilities into the cell and gene therapy cdmo sector we believe these businesses enable charles river to be a premier scientific partner for development testing and manufacturing of advanced drug modalities and further enhance our presence in the highgrowth cell and gene therapy sector 

charles river laboratories international inc 

demand for our research models and services returned to prepandemic levels as clients returned to their research sites and resumed their biomedical research efforts in earnest which drove robust revenue growth in fiscal year 2021 this was particularly true in china as the resurgence in demand outpaced north america and europe due in part to an expanded product offering and ongoing efforts to enhance the geographic reach in china demand for research model services continued to perform very well particularly for our is and gems businesses we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts in 2020 we enhanced the rms business’ growth profile and portfolio of critical research tools that we are able to supply through the acquisitions of hemacare and cellero premier providers of humanderived cellular products used in cell therapies while the performance of these cell supply businesses continued to be impacted by covid19related disruptions to donor availability in fiscal year 2021 we believe that we are taking the necessary actions to enable these businesses to achieve their full growth potential and capitalize on the robust underlying demand from cell therapy developers and manufacturers in the near future 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 35 billion compared to 29 billion in fiscal year 2020 the 2021 increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 was 6163 million or 211 and was primarily due to the increased demand across all of our reporting segments principally within dsa and the impact of rms recovering from the effects of the covid19 pandemic in the prior period as discussed in the above “business trends” section as well as the recent acquisitions principally within our manufacturing reporting segment and by the positive effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the corresponding period in 2020 

in fiscal year 2021 our operating income and operating income margin were 5899 million and 167 respectively compared with 4327 million and 148 respectively in fiscal year 2020 the increases in operating income and operating income margin were primarily due to the contribution of higher revenue described above and the recovery from the effects from the covid19 pandemic compared to the corresponding period in 2020 

net income attributable to common shareholders increased to 3910 million in fiscal year 2021 from 3643 million in the corresponding period of 2020 the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of 267 million was primarily due to the increase in operating income described above partially offset by venture capital investment losses in fiscal year 2021 as compared to gains incurred for the corresponding period in 2020 

during fiscal year 2021 our cash flows from operations was 7608 million compared with 5466 million for fiscal year 2020 the increase was driven by higher net income and improvements from our working capital initiatives including the timing of vendor and supplier payments and collections of net contract balances from contracts with customers collectively trade receivables and contract assets net deferred revenue and customer contract deposits compared to the same period in 2020 

during fiscal year 2021 we issued 1 billion of debt split between 500 million of 375 senior notes due in 2029 2029 senior notes and 500 million of 400 senior notes due in 2031 2031 senior notes in an unregistered offering interest on the 2029 and 2031 senior notes is payable semiannually on march 15 and september 15 proceeds from the 2029 and 2031 senior notes were used as follows prepay the 500 million 2026 senior notes 21 million of debt extinguishment costs and 13 million of accrued interest prepay the 1469 million remaining term loan pay down 135 million of the revolving facility and pay for a portion of the cognate acquisition additionally in april 2021 we amended and restated our credit facility by extending the maturity date to april 2026 and increasing the amount of our multicurrency revolving facility from 205 billion to 30 billion 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the application of our accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

charles river laboratories international inc 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer “transaction price” 

to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration is included in the transaction price if in our judgment it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available sales value add and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue 

when determining the transaction price of a contract an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance resulting in a significant financing component generally we do not extend payment terms beyond one year applying the practical expedient we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components 

contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations for such arrangements the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation we determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations 

contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations generally when contract modifications create new performance obligations the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively when contract modifications change existing performance obligations the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue on a cumulative catchup basis 

product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer we generally measure our progress using either costtocost input method or righttoinvoice output method we use the costtocost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract generally related to fixed fee service contracts under the costtocost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation the costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours allocation of overhead costs research model costs and subcontractor costs revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the righttoinvoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or timebased increments such as samples tested or labor hours incurred revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date during fiscal year 2021 21 billion or approximately 60 of our total revenue recognized 35 billion is dsa service revenue transferred over time 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected 

charles river laboratories international inc 

future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies our valuation allowance was 3156 million as of december 25 2021 in the event actual results differ from our estimates we will adjust our estimates in future periods and may establish additional allowances or reversals as necessary 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we generally receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options by employees or the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units held by employees the stock price timing and amount of vesting and exercising of stockbased compensation could materially impact our current tax expense 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income cost and market approaches as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

in our recent acquisitions customer relationship intangible assets also referred to as client relationships have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired to determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model a commonly accepted valuation technique which includes the following key assumptions projections of cash flows from the acquired entities which included future revenue growth rates operating income margins and customer attrition rates as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the acquired entities’ weighted average cost of capital the value of client relationships acquired were 2572 million for cognate 875 million for vigene 173 million for retrogenix and 161 million for distributed bio in fiscal year 2021 client relationships acquired for fiscal year 2020 were valued at 1704 million for hemacare and 147 million for cellero 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset no impairments were recognized during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we perform the quantitative impairment test where we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units 

charles river laboratories international inc 

under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn our 2021 and 2020 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

• significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

• significant negative industry or economic trends or 

• significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our longlived assets 

determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets no impairments were recognized during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations a 25basis point change in the discount rate changes the projected benefit obligation by approximately 17 million for all our plans 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

the charles river laboratories inc pension plan us pension plan was a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan covering certain us employees the us pension plan was amended in 2002 to exclude new participants and in 2008 the accrual of benefits was frozen in january 2019 we commenced the process to terminate this plan and received regulatory approval in april 2020 in october 2020 we settled all remaining benefits directly with vested participants through either lump sum payouts or the purchase of a group annuity contract from a qualified insurance company to administer all future payments prior to the settlement the us pension plan was underfunded with a benefit obligation of approximately 94 million and plan assets of approximately 93 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 we made a contribution of approximately 1 million to fully fund this plan to cover the lump sum payments purchase the group annuity contract and settle remaining termination costs upon settlement of the pension liability we recognized a noncash settlement charge of approximately 10 million related to pension losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other expense in the consolidated statement of income

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and rsus to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments stockbased compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value adjusted for forfeitures when they occur over the requisite service period 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of psus is estimated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change

the following table presents operating income by reportable segment 



the following presents and discusses our consolidated financial results by each of our reportable segments 

rms 



rms revenue increased 1194 million due primarily to higher research model product revenue across all geographies most notably north america and china as we recovered from the impact of the covid19 pandemic compared to fiscal year 2020 when many of our academic clients experienced closures higher research model services revenue which includes our gems insourcing solutions and rads businesses the acquisition of cellero which contributed 57 million to product revenue for the partial year prior to the acquisition’s anniversary date and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by the divestiture of rms japan which decreased revenue by 105 million 

rms operating income increased 641 million compared to fiscal year 2020 rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 242 an increase of 620 bps from 180 for fiscal year 2020 operating income and 

charles river laboratories international inc 

operating income as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to the contribution of higher revenue described above as we recovered from the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

dsa 



dsa revenue increased 2698 million due primarily to service revenue which increased in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from biotechnology and global biopharmaceutical clients increased pricing of services the acquisitions of retrogenix and distributed bio which collectively contributed 183 million to discovery services revenue and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates dsa revenue was not significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

dsa operating income increased 811 million compared to fiscal year 2020 dsa operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 193 an increase of 160 bps from 177 for fiscal year 2020 operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to the contribution of higher revenue described above as well as adjustments to contingent consideration arrangements related to certain acquisitions which are recorded within selling general and administrative costs partially offset by the impact of foreign currency these increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue were also attributable to decreased costs in both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses related to certain 2020 site closures which resulted in lower severance costs site consolidation costs and asset impairments during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 

manufacturing 



manufacturing revenue increased 2271 million due primarily to our biologics solutions business which included the cdmo business acquisitions of cognate and vigene which collectively contributed 1099 million and higher service revenue within our biologics testing solutions business increased demand for endotoxin products in our microbial solutions business as we completed the delayed instrument installations from last year’s covid19 restrictions that limited access to certain client sites and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

manufacturing operating income increased 649 million compared to fiscal year 2020 the increase in operating income was due primarily to the contribution of higher revenue in our biologics business in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 332 a decrease of 200 bps from 352 for fiscal year 2020 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue was due to the acquisitions of cognate and vigene principally due to the higher amortization of intangible assets and higher operating costs associated with the acquisitions as well as higher operating costs in our microbial solutions business during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 partially offset by adjustments to contingent consideration arrangements related to certain acquisitions which are recorded within selling general and administrative costs during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 

charles river laboratories international inc 

unallocated corporate 



unallocated corporate costs consist of selling general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated corporate costs of 529 million or 298 compared to fiscal year 2020 is primarily related to an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses and increased costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisition activity costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 65 an increase of 40 bps from 61 for fiscal year 2020 

interest income 

interest income which represents earnings on cash cash equivalents and time deposits was 07 million and 08 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest expense 

in terest expense for fiscal year 2021 was 739 million a decrease of 125 million or 145 compared to 864 million for fiscal year 2020 the decrease was due primarily to foreign currency gains recognized in connection with debtrelated foreign exchange forward contracts in fiscal year 2021 as compared to foreign currency losses recognized in fiscal year 2020 partially offset by 26 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of the 2026 senior notes and related writeoff of deferred financing costs incurred in fiscal year 2021 

other expense income net 

o ther expense net was 359 million for fiscal year 2021 a decrease of 1359 million compared to other income net of 1000 million for fiscal year 2020 the decrease was due primarily to venture capital and strategic equity investment losses of 304 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to gains of 1009 million incurred in fiscal year 2020 and foreign currency losses recognized in connection with a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus entity with a different functional currency in fiscal year 2021 as compared to foreign currency gains recognized in fiscal year 2020 partially offset by a gain on the divestiture of our rms japan business of 227 million during the three months ended december 25 2021 and the 103 million settlement loss for the termination of the us pension plan in fiscal year 2020 

income taxes 

income tax expense for fiscal year 2021 was 819 million an increase of 01 million compared to 818 million for fiscal year 2020 our effective tax rate was 170 for fiscal year 2021 compared to 183 for fiscal year 2020 the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to higher tax benefits from stockbased compensation deductions and a nontaxable gain on divestiture partially offset by the impact of enacted tax rate changes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 25 2021 our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by 116 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound and canadian dollar during fiscal year 2021 the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the japanese yen british pound euro and hungarian forint 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expenses which will decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2021 our revenue would have decreased by 1221 million and our operating income would have decreased by 53 million if the us dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 1 0 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit our foreign currency exposure related to both intercompany loans and a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus euro functional currency entity under our credit facility refer to note 14 “foreign currency contracts” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding these types of forward contracts

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp which is able to support our clients from target identification through nonclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

the development of new drugs requires a steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10 to 15 years up to 25 billion excluding time costs and exploration of between 10000 and 15000 drug molecules to produce a single food and drug administration fdaapproved drug 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4 to 6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development rd timelines 

development activities which follow and which can take up to 7 to 10 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the nonclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro nonanimal typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to establish drug safety prior to and in support of human clinical trials 

for over 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services which now encompasses the broader earlystage drug research process we are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in earlystage drug research in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients’ discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy because of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio  we are the only large global cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we can collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage and enables our clients to make critical drug development decisions more quickly we understand our clients’ therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

pharmaceutical manufacturing support portfolio we also offer a portfolio of products services and solutions that supports the process development scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry we provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products in particular we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods which provide the highest testing quality enhance productivity and reduce cycle time 

deep scientific expertis e we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities including biomarkers biologics medicinal chemistry in vitro screening in vivo pharmacology immunology pathology biologics process development testing microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain independently we continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients’ internal drug discovery and development areas of focus we also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint 

commitment to animal welfare  we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3rs” initiative replacement reduction and refinement as researchers we are responsible to our clients our animals and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work closely with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support  we maintain scientific rigor and highquality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity and quality these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible and integrated infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff while ensuring the conduct of effective quality research for their projects we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner  we believe there is an important advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo and in vitro services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work they frequently chose to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlystage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals provision of data in sponsorspecific formats for data warehousing needs accelerated reporting reduced standard reporting timelines and industryleading standard exchange of nonclinical data send capabilities a global footprint streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

our clients’ rd needs continue to evolve these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies we also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio 

we believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess their core differentiators from rd to commercialization and which aspects of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes they will choose to outsource we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as larger pharmaceutical clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure by partnering with a cro like charles river they can take advantage of efficiencies in their earlystage research activities that can result in months or years saved in getting a drug to market in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical rd business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for multiple years and drive pullthrough across our portfolio furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship because of this strategy we have been successfully renewing the majority of our strategic partnerships 

the evolving biopharmaceutical rd business model coupled with a robust funding environment have also led to the emergence of a significant number of new biotechnology companies in recent years that are discovering innovative new therapies we believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff 

our strategic imperatives are centered around our intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth enhance our operating efficiency and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment which we believe will collectively enable us to maximize value for our shareholders 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances while the covid19 pandemic interfered with the desired pace of these transactions in 2020 acquisitions such as our acquisitions of ctl international citoxlab in fiscal 2019 hemacare and cellero in fiscal 2020 and distributed bio in fiscal 2021 are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital 

in addition to conventional mergers and acquisitions our longterm strategy includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broadbased portfolio of products and services in particular our focus has been to drive differentiation through technologies that enhance the speed to develop a clinical candidate and allow biopharmaceutical companies to make earlier gonogo decisions among other arrangements these relationships may include entering into license agreements strategic partnerships or joint ventures that will allow us to access cuttingedge or nascent technologies with a modest investment component our ability to thoroughly assess these nascent technologies and market opportunities may later result in an acquisition 

we also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on earlystage companies through these partnerships and close relationships we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery safety assessment and biologics testing thus we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

clients 

our clients consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and industrial chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2020 no single commercial client accounted for more than 2 of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 10 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio because of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients’ planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada asia pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 

• for rms we have five main competitors of which one is a government funded notforprofit entity one is privately held in europe and three are privately held in the us 

• for dsa both our discovery services and safety assessment businesses have numerous competitors discovery services has hundreds of competitors but three main competitors two are public companies in china and one is a public company in europe safety assessment has dozens of competitors of varying size but one main competitor that is a division of a large public company in the us our dsa segment also competes with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies universities and teaching hospitals 

• for manufacturing each of our underlying businesses has several competitors microbial solutions has four main competitors of which three are public companies in europe and one is a private company in the us in addition to many smaller competitors biologics has five main competitors of which four are public companies in europe and one is a public company in china avian has one main competitor to its spf eggs business which is a private company in europe and numerous competitors for specialized avian laboratory services 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care imperative hci which is directed by our global animal welfare and training group the goal of hci is to ensure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health research animal behavioral management programs and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro assays we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare and the 3rs as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we also partner with clients to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we maintain a quarterly award recognizing our 

employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we fund scholarships for training in laboratory animal science provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal science field and the supporters of 3rs 

human capital resources 

as of december 26 2020 we had approximately 18400 employees including approximately 2400 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our workforce was distributed geographically approximately as follows 63 in north america 30 in europe and 7 in asia and less than 1 in any other region 

in order to support attract and retain such great talent we provide our employees with opportunities for skill building and career advancement our talent management approach is highly collaborative encourages ownership and provides the opportunity for everyone to contribute and develop through regular performance conversations annual goal setting ongoing coaching and feedback furthermore we have created a global learning strategy that includes technical training mentoring and coaching programs tuition reimbursement rotational programs leadership development programs and onthejob training in fiscal 2020 we hired over 3700 people and our voluntary turnover was below 9 

in addition to growth opportunities we strive to attract motivate and retain top talent by providing competitive compensation programs while rewarding outcomes and behaviors that align with our performance culture and values pay equity audits are performed in countries where they are legally required and we are embarking on a larger pay equity analysis as part of our continuing efforts to be competitive in the marketplace furthermore we continue to build on a global job architecture that allows for aligning pay by job role with market rates and serves as a career path tool to encourage a culture of upward mobility 

we also promote a healthy and safe workplace for our employees we maintain a global policy on safety  sustainability and as part of our efforts to promote our goals of working safely and sustainably in early 2020 we implemented a management systems approach to improve our safety performance which involves both employee and management engagement in and ownership of our sitelevel environment health safety and sustainability programs globally at every charles river site globally we have health and safety leaders that promote employee health and safety and keep site management engaged in their health and safety programs 

the covid19 pandemic has further underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy in response to the pandemic we have taken actions to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work charles river established a global crisis management team which includes a team of internal and external experts who have been closely monitoring the covid19 outbreak and its impact on employee safety and our business operations as we navigate the pandemic and focus on keeping people safe we continue to establish stringent safety protocols at our operating sites as always our goal is to provide a safe work environment for our employees while still meeting our client’s needs for their research solutions our global and site business continuity plans are comprehensive active and continuously updated as we continue to meet requirements for planned and new projects including work supporting covid19 research efforts 

we are also committed to cultivating a welcoming and inclusive environment operating in over 100 facilities and in over 20 countries worldwide excluding our insourcing solutions sites we believe in treating our employees and prospective talent with dignity decency and respect we recognize that employee diversity contributes to a more innovative workforce and see diversity and inclusivity as a strength for our business our commitment to equality spans across all employmentrelated decisions from hiring and promotions to transfers and compensation and career development programs our goal is to continue to build a talented workforce reflective of the global communities in which we live and work and it is critical that our people feel like valued members of our company we believe that we have taken positive steps to promote a sense of belonging for our employees in the workplace by building a diversity equality  inclusion team and council expanding diversity representation at our board level centralizing diversity and inclusion resources for our employees facilitating senior leadership training on cultural differences antiharassment and antidiscrimination unconscious bias and microinequities and rolling out a diverse interview panel initiative we look forward to continuing to make additional progress including expanding education allyship and integrating diversity and inclusion into our client supplier and business strategies as of december 26 2020 women made up approximately 59 of our global workforce 58 of our us workforce and 33 of our global leadership positions defined as positions carrying the title of vice president or higher from our us workforce 25 identified as racial and ethnic minorities 

our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils employee representative groups andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we collaborate with the works councils and believe we have good relationships with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 1676 million 14 billion and 792 million respectively as of december 26 2020 as compared to 1287 million 10 billion and 654 million respectively as of december 28 2019 related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client’s intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in december 26 2020 backlog may be completed in 2021 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens bred for use in research as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as europe china and japan for the care handling and use of regulated species and birds bred for research with the exception of one facility acquired as part of the cellero acquisition our dsa and rms facilities in north america and europe are either accredited or in the process of initiating accreditation by aaalac international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the scientific operational and quality process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity under newly issued guidance we have established a formal program to manage regulatory and client expectations regarding data integrity within our regulated businesses although each business has a different impact on patient safety all are expected to generate data with integrity we recognize the importance of generating quality reliable sustainable 

data and have instituted several processes and established a global governance team with oversight responsibilities for our data integrity compliance plans to ensure we are consistent in our approach to ensure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

at a global level retention of data and controls for electronic systems proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies we also have controls in place such as quality manuals policies and procedures work instructions document control processes training quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel validated computerized systems and archiving requirements within businesses procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs and to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation as appropriate under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

• the surface and air transportation of chemicals biological reagents and laboratory specimens 

• the handling use storage and disposal of chemicals including narcotics and psychotropic drugs biological reagents laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials 

• the procurement handling use storage and disposal of human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products for research purposes 

• the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities and 

• protection of the environment and general public 

global regulatory compliance programs are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance our compliance programs are also managed by global quality systems such as vendor supplier programs quality management systems and global computer system validation within each regulated business we have established quality assurance units qaus responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing our data integrity compliance program ensures that management has proper oversight with qaus of our electronic records inclusive of quality function reviews of our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

while we expect that capital expenditures will be necessary to ensure that our existing sites remain in compliance with government regulations at this point we do not expect these expenditures to materially differ than our historical experience 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on innovative technologies to enhance our portfolio with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions that are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the sec and the us federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and other applicable laws rules and regulations each member of our board of directors other than our chief executive officer is independent and has no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management all of our board committees except our executive committee and strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics that has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have established global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines to help ensure that our public disclosures including our periodic reports filed with the sec earnings releases and other written information that we disclose to the investment community are complete accurate and timely we continually monitor developments in the law and stock exchange regulations as well as overall corporate governance trends and intend to adopt new procedures consistent with such developments to the extent applicable to and appropriate for our company copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at httpircrivercom under the “investor relations  corporate governance” caption

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties and the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future documents we file with the sec 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and expanding the continuation of this outbreak may have and the emergence of other epidemic or pandemic crises could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and expanding and its ultimate scope duration and effects are uncertain this pandemic has and continues to result in and any future epidemic or pandemic crises may potentially result in direct and indirect adverse effects on our industry and customers which in turn has with respect to covid19 and may with respect to future epidemics or crises impact our business results of operations and financial condition further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us effects of the current pandemic have included or may in the future include among others 

• deterioration of worldwide regional or national economic conditions and activity which adversely affects global demand for our products and services 

• disruptions to our operations as a result of the potential health impact on our employees and crew and on the workforces of our customers and business partners 

• temporary andor partial closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers including academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations and thirdparty service providers 

• interruption of the operations of global supply chains and those of our suppliers 

• disruptions to our business from or additional costs related to new regulations directives or practices implemented in response to the pandemic such as travel restrictions shelter in placestay in placework from home orders increased inspection regimes hygiene measures such as quarantining and physical distancing or increased implementation of remote working arrangements 

• reduced cash flows and financial condition including potential liquidity constraints 

• reduced access to capital including the ability to refinance any existing obligations as a result of any credit tightening generally or due to declines in global financial markets including to the prices of publiclytraded equity securities of us our peers and of listed companies generally 

• deterioration in the financial condition and prospects of our customers or attempts by customers suppliers or service providers to invoke force majeure contractual clauses or the legal doctrines of impossibility or impracticability or other similar doctrines as a result of delays or other disruptions 

• delays in the commencement of or the suspension or cancellation of client studies and 

• the effects described elsewhere in these risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices including but not limited to health management of employees customers and suppliers management of production inventory supply chain risk management compensation practices and capital expenditure planning we have formed a tiered structure of designated covid19 crisis management teams throughout our organization to identify implement and monitor such actions as required by the dynamic exigencies arising from the pandemic such measures and others may not be sufficient to mitigate all the risks posed by covid19 and our ability to perform critical functions could be materially adversely affected 

although disruption and effects from the covid19 pandemic may be temporary given the dynamic nature of these circumstances and the worldwide nature of our business and operations the duration of any business disruption and the related financial impact to us cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we bear financial risk for contracts that may be terminated or reduced in scope underpriced subject to cost overruns or delayed 

many of our agreements including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

our counterparties including our clients who are competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including the invocation of force majeure clauses or the legal doctrines of impossibility or impracticability or other similar legal doctrines as a result of the covid19 pandemic the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested a client’s decision to forego or terminate a particular study our competitors’ establishment of alternative distribution channels dissatisfaction with our performance under the agreement the loss of funding for the particular research study or general conveniencecounterparty preference if a counterparty terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees however in many cases we are not entitled to any termination fees in the event of a termination cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

furthermore many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses the expansion and ongoing implementation of the systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including information security assessment and remediation data conversion network and system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing errors and accounting errors 

we have in the past experienced and in the future could experience an unauthorized access into our information systems 

we operate large and complex information systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such information systems to steal data or disrupt the systems or for financial gain like other companies we have on occasion experienced and will continue to experience threats and incursions to our data and systems including malicious codes and viruses phishing business email compromise and social engineering attacks or other cyberattacks the number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time 

while we have taken measures to protect our information systems from intrusion in march 2019 we detected evidence that an unauthorized third party who we believe was well resourced and highly sophisticated accessed certain of our information systems and copied data we worked with a leading cyber security firm to assist in our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities our investigation indicated that the affected information included client information 

in december 2019 we disclosed that we had completed our remediation of the incident identified in march of 2019 while we have implemented additional security safeguards including 

• remediation of the march 2019 incident 

• cooperation with us federal authorities’ investigation into the incident and established an ongoing relationship to better understand the everchanging nature of cybersecurity related threats 

• additional visibility into our network and environment 

• additional monitoring of our environment 

• active threat hunting in our environment 

• enhanced protection for externally facing web applications 

• the addition of multifactor authentication to ingress points 

• the addition of denial of service attack protection and 

• increased network segmentation 

such efforts may not be successful in which case we could suffer significant harm 

further we are at risk of being targeted and we have in the past been victim to business email compromise fraud which results in payments being made to illegitimate bank accounts although these instances have not resulted in our incurring material losses if similar instances occur in the future we may incur such losses 

our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from the studies we conduct in the event the confidentiality of such information is compromised whether by unauthorized access or other breaches we could be exposed to significant harm including termination of customer contracts damage to our customer relationships damage to our reputation and potential legal claims from customers employees and other parties in addition we may face investigations by government regulators and agencies as a result of a breach 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may be adversely impacted 

during the last two decades we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of hemacare cellero and distributed bio and our recently announced planned acquisition of cognate bioservices inc however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties in achieving business and financial success including as a result of covid19 pandemic and the longterm economic impact of the pandemic 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products information technology platforms technologies or preexisting relationships with our clients distributors and suppliers 

• challenges with developing and operating new businesses including those that are materially different from our existing businesses and that may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise 

• potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller or the insurance we acquire in connection with the transaction 

• loss of key employees 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• a more expansive regulatory environment 

• acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders 

• differences in foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies 

• new technologies and products may be developed that cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable and 

• disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business technology service or product that may result in litigation expenses and diversion of our management’s attention 

if an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses including specific product lines and service offerings to determine whether any divestitures are appropriate any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line or service offering and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely impact our results foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the us could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar resulting in a reduction in the amount of revenue and cash flow and an increase in the amount of expenses that we recognize and causing fluctuations in reported financial results we also carry foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where we conduct business for example certain contracts are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary’s functional currency while our financial results are reported in us dollars the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency during consolidation these results are translated into us dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results moreover as exchange rates vary revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity 

other risks associated with our international business include 

• general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate including implications of brexit and the covid19 pandemic 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in us andor foreign tax laws or interpretations and enforcement thereof notably tax regulations issued and tobeissued with respect to us tax reform and the eu antitax avoidance directives i and ii and the creation of the joint chiefs of global tax enforcement 

• potential international conflicts including terrorist acts 

• exchange controls adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the us 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of covid19 pandemic related suspensions of operations work stoppages andor strikes as well as violations of local laws or antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to the covid19 pandemic 

• unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions including those relating to the covid19 pandemic 

• longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 and 

• compliance with export controls import requirements and other trade regulations including those relating to certain products of which there is limited supply 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the fcpa and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their thirdparty intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and have been and will continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic 

we depend on our customers and facilities for the continued operation of our business while we maintain disaster recovery plans they might not adequately protect us despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events these events including terrorist attack a pandemic including the covid19 pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a disease hurricanes fire floods and ice and snow storms could result in damage to and closure of our or our customers’ facilities or the infrastructure on which such facilities rely as described herein the covid19 pandemic has already and will continue to materially disrupt our operations though the full extent of such impact remains uncertain such disruptions could include significant delays in the shipments of our products reduce our capacity to provide services adversely impact unique manufacturing capabilities result in our customers’ inability to pay for our products or services and ultimately result in the loss of revenue and clients although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our customers could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services that we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and a significant amount are mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders 

furthermore the habitat of certain animals used for research purposes may be located in or near certain environmentally protected areas or conservation areas activities conducted by us or any of our agents within these areas may be legally challenged and result in similar negative attention and action from environmental protection activists including advocacy for the expansion of environmental restrictions applicable to such areas any negative attention threats acts of vandalism or legal action directed against our animal research or procurement activities or our thirdparty service providers such as our airline carriers or suppliers or that restrict our or their ability to access protected or conservation areas could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

industry risk factors 

a reduction in demand may adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 also affect their rd budgets and consequentially our business as well 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of rd and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on lowering rd costs per drug candidate fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the rd budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services rd budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations including potential drug pricing legislation available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing rd budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

further our research products operations are structured to produce particular blood products based on customers’ existing demand and perceived potential changes in demand for these products sudden or unexpected changes in demand for these products could have an adverse impact on our profitability increasing demand could harm relationships with customers if we are unable to alter production capacity or purchase products from other suppliers to fill orders adequately this could result in a decrease in overall revenue and profits the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 caused us to temporarily suspend blood donations which have since resumed at our research products facilities further limiting our ability to respond to changes in demand lack of access to sufficient capital or lack of adequate time to properly or the failure to adequately respond to changes in demand could result in declining revenue and profits as customers transfer to other suppliers 

a reduction or delay in government funding of rd may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue predominantly in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast we also sell directly to the nih and these other agencies government funding of rd is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals included reduced allocations to government agencies that fund rd activities government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund rd activities or nih funding may not be directed towards projects and studies that require the use of our products and services both of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results furthermore changes in government budgetary priorities as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 could reduce government funding of rd that is unrelated to the disease which could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply that when interrupted adversely affects our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply from time to time arise from health problems including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the spread of other diseases export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes tariffs international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency geopolitical disputes measures intended to slow the spread of covid19 or other ordinary course or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could materially harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms for example as with other industry participants certain of our activities rely on a sufficient supply of large research models which has seen increasing demand as compared to supply in 2020 and into 2021 due to a variety of factors first the surge of research relating to covid19 has increased short term demand second china supplies a significant portion of certain critical large research models which have been subject to geographic export restrictions applicable to many animal species since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic while we continue to take steps to find alternative supply channels and lock in supply with preferred sources through multiyear andor minimum commitment contracts such mitigating efforts may not prove successful at ensuring a steady and timely supply or may require and in the past have required us to pay significantly higher prices for such products during periods of global shortage or restrictions on the transportation of products limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from nonpreferred vendors which may not be successful in addition reductions in global air transportation routes may result in sourcing alternative transportation at an increased cost an inability to obtain a sufficient and timely supply of critical products could adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations 

further our research products business depends on the availability of appropriate donors as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 we temporarily suspended blood donations at one of our research products facilities regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply including covid19 could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors or integrity of inventory due to any pandemic epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our research products business operates the portion of the donor pool that typically donates may be unable or unwilling to donate thereby significantly reducing the availability of research products upon which we rely in addition health and healthcare concerns among the public may result in a decline in donations if donor participation declines we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to maintain profitability of the research products business 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client’s facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection and liability for damages to infected persons 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification the third party may refuse to fulfill its indemnification obligation or may be unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also 

exists and may require us to restart the applicable colonies and would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements 

further many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems that are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently influenced outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 filed with the commission on february 11 2020 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete for business with other cros and blood product and therapeutic services companies as well as internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

• reputation for ontime quality performance 

• reputation for regulatory compliance 

• expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas 

• scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum 

• scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the manufacturing support spectrum 

• ability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients’ drug discovery nonclinical development and manufacturing support needs 

• broad geographic availability with consistent quality 

• pricevalue spend and flexibility 

• technological and scientific expertise and efficient drug development processes 

• quality of facilities 

• financial stability 

• size 

• ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner and 

• accessibility of client data through secure portals 

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies which are targets for each other and for large pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering 

entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research which could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to develop methods to improve cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from nonclinical to clinical studies further some companies are developing synthetic alternatives to lal which is derived from live animals it is our strategy to explore new technologies to refine and potentially reduce the use of animal models and animal derived products as new in vitro methods become validated however we may not be able to develop new products inputs or processes effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models inputs or processes with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and that may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our clients our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

costs increasing more rapidly than market prices could reduce profitability 

the cost of collecting processing and testing blood products has risen significantly in recent years and will likely continue to increase these cost increases are related to new and improved testing procedures increased regulatory requirements related to blood safety and higher staff and supply costs related to collecting and processing blood products competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating margins some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable sales costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

legal  regulatory risk factors 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning letter from the fda based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for glp or cgmp requirements that are not addressed to the regulatory monitoring authorities’ satisfaction could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines or the temporary closure of our facilities any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in recent years fda has issued guidance that now requires submissions to be presented in a format that conforms with the fda’s send standardization for exchange of nonclinical data standards that apply to our clients’ nda and ind submissions and require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews accordingly our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send notwithstanding some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community noncompliance with any of these expectations could lead to official action by a government authority damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our research products business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by federal state and local governments in the us and in the other countries in which it operates this business requires us to obtain many licenses permits authorizations approvals certificates and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate federal state and local regulations change often and new regulations are frequently adopted changes in the regulations could require us to change the way in which we operate our business and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant 

our donor collection centers are registered with the fda and the fda periodically conducts inspections of those facilities and operations at the conclusion of each inspection the fda provides us with a list of observations of regulatory issues discovered during the inspection that could result in additional regulatory action failure to comply with the regulations of the fda could result in sanctions andor remedies and have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping our customers navigate these regulatory processes accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies including the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures that utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted healthcare reform legislation the patient protection and affordable care act aca which includes provisions impacting drug manufacturers such as 1 the expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 the expansion of the medicaid program 3 the enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 the imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices in addition the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 repeals the aca’s individual health insurance mandate which is considered a key component of the aca since the aca and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations the ultimate effects of this legislation are unclear on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings 

furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on rd 

while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level or in laws and regulations in effect in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or have business relationships may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients furthermore modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a materially adverse impact on us our suppliers or our clients 

we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties andor other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions for example we are required to comply with the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 and imposes heightened obligations and enhanced penalties for noncompliance including up to four percent 4 of global revenue the cost of compliance and the potential for fines and penalties for noncompliance with gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations recent legal developments in the eu have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the eu to the us including the invalidation of the euus privacy shield framework in july 2020 and proposed updates to the eu standard contractual clauses in november 2020 if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate it could affect the manner in which we provide our services the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations and could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu we will have to comply with the eu gdpr and the gdpr as implemented in the united kingdom the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu with respect to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction which exposes us to further compliance risk 

the california consumer privacy act ccpa became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa creates new transparency requirements for companies and grants california residents several new rights with regard their personal information failure to comply with the ccpa may result in among other things significant civil penalties and injunctive relief or potential statutory or actual damages in addition california voters recently approved the california privacy rights act cpra which modifies the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in california including granting additional privacy rights to consumers and creating a new state privacy regulator while the cpra will not take effect until january 2023 it may impact our business activities and require compliance costs that adversely affect business operating results prospects and financial condition 

we have made changes to and investments in our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate changes to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex regulations additionally while collecting research products from donors we may collect use disclose maintain and transmit donor information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure storage transmission or confidentiality of patientidentifiable health information failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties andor other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to comply with us state local or international environmental health and safety laws and regulations including regulations issued by the occupational safety and health administration environmental protection agency nuclear regulatory agency and department of transportation could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure and have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

we are subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety including laws and regulations relating to the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees and protecting employees from the spread of covid19 failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties andor other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us that may be costly 

changes in us and international tax law or material changes in our stock price could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate 

in 2017 significant us tax law changes from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 us tax reform went into effect and reduced the us federal statutory tax rate broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits limited the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense and allowed for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us with a 100 federal dividends received deduction prospectively in addition us tax reform required a onetime transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings there remain certain provisions enacted as part of us tax reform which still require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue service irs and treasury department these or other changes in us tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows 

additionally the oecd the european commission ec and individual taxing jurisdictions have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations the oecd released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of rules to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany luxembourg netherlands and the uk in addition the oecd and ec and individual countries are examining how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from enacted laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments france and the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flows and effective tax rate 

further we generally receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options by employees or the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units held by employees the stock price timing and amount of the vesting and exercising of sharebased compensation could adversely impact our effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

• risks associated with errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in nonclinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing 

• risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients’ property such as research models and samples study compounds records work in progress other archived materials or goods and materials in transit while in our possession 

• risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to them or humans despite preventive measures for the quarantine and handling of imported animals 

• risks that we may have errors and omissions andor product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices injectable drugs food beverages and home and beauty products primarily through our microbial solutions business or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our biologics business which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials and 

• risk of transmitting dangerous infectious diseases as a result of the failure of our screening and testing processes or new pathogens that may be undetected by such processes 

while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore either we or a party required to indemnify us may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

the failure to successfully obtain maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to our intellectual property rights could adversely affect us 

many of our services products and processes rely on intellectual property in some cases that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to us sometimes exclusively to protect our intellectual property rights we primarily rely upon trade secret law confidentiality agreements and policies invention assignments and other contractual arrangements along with patent copyright and trademark laws existing laws of certain countries outside of the united states in which we operate offer only limited protection and these are subject to change at any time in addition the agreements upon which we rely to protect our intellectual property might be breached or might not be fully enforceable our intellectual property rights might not prevent our competitors from independently developing intellectual property that is similar to or duplicative of ours also enforcing our intellectual property rights might also require substantial time money and oversight and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights if we are unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to our intellectual property if we are unable to prevent attempted infringement against our intellectual property or if we are unable to defend against claims that we are infringing on another party’s intellectual property we could be adversely affected these adverse effects could include us having to abandon alter or delay the deployment of products services or processes that rely on such intellectual property having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that we seek to use and having to pay damages fines court costs and attorneys fees in connection with intellectual property litigation 

further the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may adversely affect our business 

the first stage of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” took place on january 31 2020 when the uk left the european union and entered a transition phase during the transition phase the uk engaged in negotiations with the european union on the terms of its future trading and other relationships with the european union the scope and timing of these negotiations created significant uncertainty the timing of the agreement reached between the uk and the european union at the end of 2020 continues that uncertainty and given the need to understand the implications of the agreement and the formalities required in respect of the uk’s future relationship with the european union we have formed a committee comprised of senior managers across our business functions to address key risks among four main themes 1 trade and customs 2 employees and immigration 3 strategy and business planning and 4 legislative changes that committee will continue until the situation is clarified 

notwithstanding the agreement reached the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the european union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure and additional vat requirements these changes to the trading relationship between the uk and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period although we are undertaking efforts to mitigate those risks within our control a failure to adequately mitigate such risks or other factors outside our control could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows” 

our bylaws designate the state courts located in the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions including derivative actions which could limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds 

favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers other employees or the companys stockholders and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company’s stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or the company’s certificate of incorporation or the company’s bylaws in each case as they may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware however this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought under the federal securities laws for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business and financial condition furthermore although we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

labor  employment risk factors 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer and president since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades while we entered into an employment agreement with mr foster in 2018 most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements except in jurisdictions outside of the united states where employment contracts are common for most employees if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process that identifies successors and potential talent needs there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our team members 

our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils employee representative groups andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees if we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor organizations we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

financial and accounting risk factors 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

as of december 26 2020 we had 20 billion of debt and finance leases debt in connection with our intended acquisition of cognate bioservices inc we anticipate increasing our debt to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price of approximately 875 million in cash our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 9 “longterm debt and finance lease obligations” included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the interest rate on our credit facility credit facility which matures in fiscal year 2023 is linked to libor as of december 26 2020 amounts outstanding on our credit facility were 1469 million on our term loan and 8148 million on our revolving credit facility for which there is an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 205 billion in 2017 the financial conduct 

authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop if libor ceases to exist the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our debt in the future may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity while we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phaseout or replacement of libor such efforts may not prove successful in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of measures intended to reduce the spread of covid19 could among other things impact the discount rate other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets should the covid19 pandemic have a prolonged impact on our industry triggering events may arise resulting in intangible asset or goodwill impairments to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 26 2020 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was 26 billion 

general risk factors 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by the risks discussed above as well as changes in the general global economy changes in the mix of our products and services cyclical buying patterns of our clients the financial performance of our venture capital investments and the occasional extra week “53rd week” that we recognize in a fiscal year and fourth fiscal quarter thereof due to our fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

covid19 

overview 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic is dynamic and expanding and its ultimate scope duration and effects are uncertain this pandemic has had and may continue to result in direct and indirect adverse effects on our industry and customers which in turn has impacted our business results of operations and financial condition further the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in ways that are and are not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results but which may in fact turn out to negatively affect us to a magnitude greater than anticipated refer to item 1a “risk factors” included herein for risk factors reflecting the impact of the covid19 pandemic giving consideration to each of these risk factors the following is our current estimate and belief of the impact of the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 and how it may continue to affect us in subsequent periods 

business continuity 

to date we generally have not experienced significant challenges in implementing our business continuity plans many government agencies have provided guidance permitting “essential” or “critical” business operations to remain open as of the date of this annual report in the geographies where business restrictions have been imposed we believe all of our business operations have satisfied the requirements to be designated to be “essential” or “critical” according to the guidance provided by government health and other regulatory agencies with authority over such matters as a result all of our operating sites remain open and adequately staffed as of the date of this annual report for certain operations or sites experiencing logistical delays we have experienced some inefficiencies as it relates to completing work or fulfilling orders however we do not believe material expenditures will be required or material resource constraints will occur logistical delays include a small number of sites that have experienced reduced operations including as a result of increased employee absenteeism or voluntarily closed as well as delays in transportation activities 

we have comprehensive business continuity plans in place for each site globally and are continuously updating these to address the evolving covid19 pandemic situation we implemented our initial plans in china beginning in january 2020 and have continuously refined our plans for other regions as the virus has spread we have encouraged and expressed our expectations that employees work remotely whenever possible and for those employees who need to come into our sites to fulfill their responsibilities we are adhering to guidelines from government health and other regulatory agencies this includes social distancing flexible scheduling such as split shifts restricting visitors enhanced cleaning and providing personal protective equipment ppe such as masks and gloves to employees due to the nature of our business many employees already work in biosecure environments that require ppe and adhere to other procedures to safely accomplish their daily responsibilities accordingly to date we believe we have been able to efficiently implement the additional safety precautions 

supply chain 

we are focused on ensuring that we have adequate inventory and supplies on hand given the potential disruption of the covid19 pandemic to our suppliers and their supply chain accordingly we have and expect to continue to increase inventory and supplies in 2021 we proactively engaged with our suppliers beginning in january 2020 to limit any potential disruption to our supply chain however notwithstanding generally successful efforts to maintain supply chain continuity we have experienced increased costs and delays throughout our supply chain during the pandemic 

financial condition and results of our global operations 

we are a global company that operates in over 100 facilities and in over 20 countries worldwide as we perform business across various borders we are experiencing a continuum of impacts in each location as the covid19 pandemic has impacted the global economy in different phases we are continuing to see demand for products and services across all of our businesses although as described below the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the level of demand varies with our different businesses while there is uncertainty our clients are still in need of the products and services we provide to biomedical research to advance discovery and develop new therapies for the treatment of disease including the covid19 pandemic due to certain restrictions in place at the various sites of our clients and suppliers including client and supplier site closures there have been challenges relating to timely receiving and shipping products globally in all businesses should these restrictions continue demandsupply issues may persist and could impact revenue growth operating income including operating income margins and cash flows we have observed some impact due to constraints from internal site restrictions remote work resources and productivity however we believe the impact to us has not been as significant as to companies in many other industries because of the nature of our businesses the classification of our businesses as essential or critical as the case may be and our business continuity plans 

our rms business was meaningfully impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 demand for research models declined due primarily to the physical shutdown of our client’s facilities principally academic institutions while many of our clients are deemed essential businesses as well we experienced a slowdown initially in china in january 2020 and then across europe and north america later in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 as measures were implemented by various governments to slow the spread of the covid19 pandemic this trend of reduced demand for research models continued during the second fiscal quarter of 2020 which negatively impacted revenue operating income operating income margins and cash flows during the third fiscal quarter of 2020 we experienced an increase in demand as our clients reopened impacted sites and resumed their research activity which positively impacted revenue operating income operating income margins and cash flows which continued through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 research models services specifically our gems and insourcing solutions businesses experienced higher revenues during fiscal year 2020 compared to the corresponding prior period and were not as adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

our dsa business was not significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 towards the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2020 we experienced some client work shifting towards subsequent quarters of fiscal year 2020 due to the 

various actions and restrictions put in place by governments around the world intended to slow the spread of the covid19 pandemic the work performed in our discovery services and safety assessment businesses are largely dependent on our internal sites being open therefore to the extent that clients require work to be completed we have been able to continue to meet client demands and perform the work so long as our work force at the specific site the work is done is not significantly adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic this trend is expected to continue as government actions to slow the spread of the covid19 pandemic continues to subside employees return to work and economies across the world reopen costs of supply have and may continue to increase as we procure the materials required to perform our work 

our manufacturing business was not significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 however some of our customers experienced disruptions in their manufacturing operations this resulted in delays in instrument installations in our microbial solutions business which began during the first half of fiscal 2020 and continued to a lesser extent during the second half of fiscal 2020 demand for certain manufacturing products was not significantly impacted such as microbial solutions endotoxin products and avian products our biologics testing facilities remain open and performing services for our clients similar to our other services businesses our ability to perform work is contingent on our internal facilities and our work force not being significantly adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

liquidity capital and financial resources 

we require cash to fund working capital needs as well as capital expansion acquisitions venture capital and strategic investments debt obligations leases and pension obligations the principal sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations supplemented by longterm borrowings in fiscal year 2019 we issued 500 million senior notes repaid part of our term loan for 500 million and increased our multicurrency revolving facility by 500 million from 155 billion to 21 billion as of december 26 2020 we had 20 billion of debt and finance leases outstanding of which 502 million is current available on the revolving line of credit revolver is 12 billion which matures on march 26 2023 and does not require scheduled payments before that date should additional borrowings occur the term loan facility matures in 19 quarterly installments with the last installment due march 26 2023 the senior notes become due in 2026 and 2028 

due to the uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we borrowed an additional 150 million from the revolver during the first fiscal quarter of 2020 to protect against any prolonged adverse impacts on liquidity markets while there remained uncertainty throughout fiscal 2020 we did not need to use these borrowings to fund operations and these funds were repaid during the third fiscal quarter of 2020 we expect to generate cash inflows from our operating activities sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs as well as to service our debt pension and venture capital obligations due to this higher debt we incurred immaterially higher interest expense we did not need to borrow additional funds during 2020 as of december 26 2020 there is significant capacity on the remaining revolver accordingly we do not anticipate a material risk of noncompliance with our debt covenants based on our current estimate of future earnings 

to protect against adverse liquidity concerns there are various mechanisms for us to improve cash flows during the second fiscal quarter of 2020 we implemented certain cost reduction plans including delaying compensation related increases implementing hiring restrictions reducing working hours reducing all nonessential travel and reducing certain discretionary spending beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2020 we reinstated certain annual compensation increases which had previously been delayed from the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 additionally we had temporarily slowed our investment activity including acquisitions and capital projects but have since resumed certain of those activities including the acquisitions of cellero llc cellero during the third fiscal quarter of 2020 and distributed bio during the first fiscal quarter of 2021 

as of the date these financial statements are issued based on our current and expected liquidity position we do not believe there is significant uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 

recoverability andor impairment of assets 

the covid19 pandemic did not and is not expected to impact the ability to timely account for assets on our balance sheet there are judgments involved as it relates to reviewing our allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of inventory and valuationsrecovery of investments we believe we have the necessary support for estimates derived for these account balances we have reviewed the collectability and valuation of the assets through the date of financial statement issuance noting no significant recoverability concerns or any impairments identified gains and losses on certain investments in venture capital funds are recorded on a quarterly lag due to the availability of the funds’ financial information which is consistent with our venture capital investment accounting policy described in this annual report we did not identify any triggering events when reviewing impairment indicators for our goodwill and longlived assets tangible and intangible that would indicate an impairment may exist should a prolonged disruption occur where there is a material change from our current expectation of future cash flows we could experience additional writeoffs of client receivables or impairments to certain asset balances due to 

collectability and valuation issues review of impairment indicators and quantifying any impact will continue to be a focus throughout fiscal year 2021 

internal controls over financial reporting in a remote work environment 

internal controls over financial reporting are a focus for us to ensure they continue to be designed and operating effectively as of december 26 2020 and through the issuance of these financial statements we did not have any material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting for personnel responsible for internal control activities and working remote the ability to work effectively enabled us to continue to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting system and efficiency programs implemented in recent years as well as those implemented as part of business continuity plans have enabled us to effectively complete our financial reporting process in a similar way we completed it prior to the covid19 pandemic despite a largely remote working environment although there is uncertainty over the duration of the covid19 pandemic disruption we do not anticipate any adverse impact to relevant systems or to the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 

recent acquisitions 

our strategy is to augment internal growth of existing businesses with complementary acquisitions we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of products and services to support the drug discovery and development continuum our recent acquisitions are described below 

on february 17 2021 we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire cognate bioservices inc for approximately 875 million in cash subject to customary closing adjustments cognate bioservices inc is a cell and gene therapy cdmo offering comprehensive manufacturing solutions for cell therapies as well as for the development and production of plasmid dna and viral vectors for gene therapies the planned acquisition of cognate bioservices inc will create a scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development testing and manufacturing providing clients with an integrated solution from basic research through cgmp production the proposed transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021 the proposed acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our credit facility under the multicurrency revolving facility this business is expected to be reported as part of our manufacturing reportable segment

fiscal quarters 

our fiscal year is typically based on 52weeks with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on or closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 a 53 rd week was included in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar yearend 

business trends 

the global economy faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic as did our company but we believe the resilience of our business model has enabled us to weather these challenges extremely well this resilience was the result of comprehensive business continuity plans that enabled us to keep our operating sites open and adequately staffed the global scale broad scientific capabilities and flexible outsourcing solutions that we are able to offer clients and the commitment of our global employees while several of our businesses experienced a significant shortterm decline in demand associated with covid19related disruptions at our clients’ sites primarily in the rms reportable segment and principally in the second quarter of 2020 we also benefited from persistent client demand across many of our businesses including in our dsa reportable segment driven by robust biotech funding and continued innovation that is generating scientific breakthroughs across multiple therapeutic areas including for covid19 therapeutics 

many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients intensified their use of strategic outsourcing during 2020 to overcome challenges at their own sites and move their earlystage research programs forward during the pandemic small and midsize biotechnology clients continued to be the primary driver of revenue growth as these clients benefited from record biotechnology funding levels in fiscal year 2020 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital as the covid19 pandemic enhanced the global focus on scientific innovation and emphasized greater investment in their preclinical pipelines many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros like us and biotechnology companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market clients continue to seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us which is leading to new business opportunities as clients adopt more flexible and efficient research and development models 

the primary result of these trends was robust revenue growth within our dsa reportable segment in fiscal year 2020 which experienced only a limited impact related to covid19 and benefited from incremental outsourcing activity from our clients as they sought a reliable cro partner to help move their programs forward amidst the challenges of covid19 robust safety assessment revenue growth in fiscal year 2020 was primarily driven by increased demand and pricing we believe the acquisitions of citoxlab 2019 mpi research 2018 and wil research 2016 have solidified our scientific capabilities and global scale and the breadth and depth of our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us as biotechnology funding remains robust and our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research to bring innovative new therapies to market they are evaluating outsourcing more of their research programs such as discovery services we continued to enhance our discovery services capabilities to provide clients with a comprehensive portfolio that enables them to start working with us at the earliest stages of the discovery process we have accomplished this through acquisitions including distributed bio in december 2020 fiscal year 2021 citoxlab’s discovery services kws biotest in january 2018 and brains online in august 2017 and through adding cuttingedge capabilities to our discovery toolkit through partnerships such as bitbio cypre and fios genomics in fiscal year 2020 demand in our discovery services business also increased significantly as our efforts to enhance our scientific capabilities provide clients with flexible partnering models and become a trusted scientific partner for our clients’ earlystage programs have been successful 

overall demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was strong in fiscal year 2020 our biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market including cell and gene therapies as well as covid19 therapeutics demand for our microbial solutions was affected by delayed instrument installations as certain client sites were inaccessible due to 

covid19 restrictions we were able to complete additional instrument installations and the revenue growth rate for microbial solutions did improve as the year progressed 

demand for our research models and services was negatively impacted in fiscal year 2020 particularly during the second quarter worldwide demand for research models declined sharply principally in the second quarter as covid19related restrictions such as stayathome orders disrupted our clients’ research activities many academic clients closed their research sites temporarily and there was also a significant reduction in order activity from both large biopharmaceutical and smaller biotechnology clients as these clients reduced their onsite activities clients began to resume more normalized research activities in the third quarter and demand for research models began to rebound demand for research models services experienced very little impact from covid19 in fiscal year 2020 and these businesses performed very well particularly for our is and gems businesses we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts in 2020 we enhanced the rms business’ growth profile and portfolio of critical research tools that we are able to supply through the acquisitions of hemacare and cellero premier providers of humanderived cellular products used in cell therapies hemacare and cellero together generated revenue of 481 million in fiscal year 2020 as robust underlying client demand in the cell therapy market was partially offset by covid19related disruptions 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 29 billion compared to 26 billion in fiscal year 2019 the 2020 increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 was 3027 million or 115 and was primarily due to both growth in our dsa and manufacturing segments as discussed in the above “business trends” section as well as the recent acquisitions of hemacare and cellero in our rms segment and by the positive effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the corresponding period in 2019 partially offset by a reduction in rms product revenue due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic when compared to the corresponding period in 2019 

in fiscal year 2020 our operating income and operating income margin were 4327 million and 148 respectively compared with 3512 million and 134 respectively in fiscal year 2019 the increases in operating income and operating income margin were primarily due to contributions from our dsa and manufacturing segments and lower acquisition related costs compared to the corresponding period in 2019 partially offset by lower rms operating income and operating income margin due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic as well as increased amortization of intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions of hemacare and cellero 

net income attributable to common shareholders increased to 3643 million in fiscal year 2020 from 2520 million in the corresponding period of 2019 the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of 1123 million was primarily due to higher operating income mentioned above and higher net gains on our venture capital investments compared to the corresponding period in 2019  

during fiscal year 2020 our cash flows from operations was 5466 million compared with 4809 million for fiscal year 2019 the increase was driven by higher net income and certain favorable changes in working capital items including favorable timing of certain government deferrals of payroll tax payments and compensation related items partially offset by the timing of vendor and supplier payments and collections of net contract balances from contracts with customers collectively trade receivables net deferred revenue and customer contract deposits and certain pension related payments compared to the same period in 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the application of our accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant 

accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer “transaction price” 

to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration is included in the transaction price if in our judgment it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available sales value add and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue 

when determining the transaction price of a contract an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance resulting in a significant financing component generally we do not extend payment terms beyond one year applying the practical expedient we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components 

contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations for such arrangements the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation we determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations 

contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations generally when contract modifications create new performance obligations the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively when contract modifications change existing performance obligations the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue on a cumulative catchup basis 

product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer we generally measure our progress using either costtocost input method or righttoinvoice output method we use the costtocost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract generally related to fixed fee service contracts under the costtocost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation the costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours allocation of overhead costs research model costs and subcontractor costs revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the righttoinvoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or timebased increments such as samples tested or labor hours incurred revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date during fiscal year 2020 18 billion or approximately 60 of our total revenue recognized 29 billion is dsa service revenue transferred over time 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of 

items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations our valuation allowance increased by 249 million from 3100 million as of december 28 2019 to 3348 million as of december 26 2020 the increase is primarily a result of foreign exchange impact on net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances relating to the company’s 2019 financing structure changes 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we generally receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options by employees or the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units held by employees the stock price timing and amount of vesting and exercising of stockbased compensation could materially impact our current tax expense 

in 2017 significant us tax law changes from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 us tax reform went into effect and reduced the us federal statutory tax rate broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits limited the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense and allowed for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us with a 100 federal dividends received deduction prospectively in addition us tax reform required a onetime transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings 

our accounting for the elements of us tax reform is complete we have made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

in our recent acquisitions customer relationship intangible assets also referred to as client relationships have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired to determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model a commonly accepted valuation technique which includes the following key assumptions projections of cash flows from the acquired entities which included future revenue growth rates operating income margins and customer attrition rates as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the acquired entities’ weighted average cost of capital the value of client relationships acquired were 1704 million for hemacare and 147 million for cellero in fiscal year 2020 1346 million for citoxlab in fiscal year 2019 and 2649 million for mpi research in fiscal year 2018 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset no impairments were recognized during 2020 2019 or 2018 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we perform the quantitative impairment test where we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference in fiscal 2020 we adopted asu 201704 “simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” the standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing step 2 of the quantitative goodwill impairment test which previously required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the amount of a goodwill impairment loss 

in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2020 2019 and 2018 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

• significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

• significant negative industry or economic trends or 

• significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our longlived assets 

determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations a 25basis point change in the discount rate changes the projected benefit obligation by approximately 17 million for all our plans 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

the charles river laboratories inc pension plan us pension plan is a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan covering certain us employees the us pension plan was amended in 2002 to exclude new participants and in 2008 the accrual of benefits was frozen in january 2019 we commenced the process to terminate this plan and received regulatory approval in april 2020 in october 2020 we settled all remaining benefits directly with vested participants through either lump sum payouts or the purchase of a group annuity contract from a qualified insurance company to administer all future payments prior to the settlement the us pension plan was underfunded with a benefit obligation of approximately 94 million and plan assets of approximately 93 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 we made a contribution of approximately 1 million to fully fund this plan to cover the lump sum payments purchase the group annuity contract and settle remaining termination costs upon settlement of the pension liability we recognized a noncash settlement charge of approximately 10 million related to pension losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other expense in the consolidated statement of income 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and rsus to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments stockbased compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value adjusted for forfeitures when they occur over the requisite service period 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of psus is estimated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change

the following table presents operating income by reportable segment 



the following presents and discusses our consolidated financial results by each of our reportable segments 

rms 



rms revenue increased 340 million or 63 due primarily to the recent acquisitions of hemacare and cellero which contributed 430 million and 51 million respectively higher research model services revenue specifically our gems and insourcing solutions businesses and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offsetting these 

increases were lower research model product revenue in north america and europe due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

rms operating income decreased 312 million or 233 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 180 a decrease of 69 from 249 for the corresponding period in 2019 operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the lower sales volume for research model products due to the covid19 pandemic as described above and due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the recent acquisitions of hemacare and cellero 

dsa 



dsa revenue increased 2184 million or 135 due primarily to service revenue increases in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from biotechnology clients and increased pricing of services the acquisition of citoxlab which contributed 602 million to service revenue growth and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates additionally dsa revenue was not significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 

dsa operating income increased 670 million or 259 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 dsa operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 177 an increase of 17 from 160 for the corresponding period in 2019 these increases were primarily attributable to the higher revenue described above realizing the benefit from operating efficiency and cost control initiatives and lower acquisition related costs and severance costs primarily impacting selling general and administrative costs these increases were partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses related to recent site closures and higher amortization of intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions 

manufacturing 



manufacturing revenue increased 503 million or 108 due primarily to higher service revenue in the biologics business due to our facility in pennsylvania being fully operational in 2020 compared to 2019 where work continued to be transitioned from a legacy facility higher demand for products in both our microbial solutions’ endotoxin business and our avian business and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by lower product revenue in our microbial solutions’ bioburden business specifically due to the timing of a large stocking order from a strategic partner in 2019 which did not recur in 2020 and delays in instrument installations caused by the covid19 pandemic overall manufacturing revenue was not significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2020 

manufacturing operating income increased 361 million or 248 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 352 an increase of 39 from 313 

for the corresponding period in 2019 the increases were due primarily to higher revenue as well as improved production efficiencies including the absence of duplicative biologics facilities in 2020 compared to 2019 and the impact of operating efficiencies realized during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

unallocated corporate 



unallocated corporate costs consist of selling general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments the decrease in unallocated corporate costs of 96 million or 52 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is predominantly associated with decreased costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisition activity as we temporarily slowed our acquisition activity during fiscal year 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic  costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 61 a decrease of 10 from 71 for the corresponding period in 2019 

interest income interest income which represents earnings on cash cash equivalents and time deposits was 08 million and 15 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease of 07 million was primarily due to lower interest rates on invested funds in 2020 as compared to 2019 

interest expense in terest expense for fiscal year 2020 was 864 million an increase of 255 million or 420 compared to 609 million for fiscal year 2019 the increase was due primarily to foreign currency losses recognized in connection with debtrelated foreign exchange forward contracts in fiscal year 2020 compared to foreign currency gains recognized in fiscal year 2019 

other income net o ther income net was 1000 million for fiscal year 2020 an increase of 877 million or 7133 compared to 123 million for fiscal year 2019 the increase was due to net gains on our venture capital and strategic equity investments of 1009 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to 207 million in fiscal year 2019 resulting primarily from increases in fair value from our publiclyheld investments which included initial public offerings of certain portfolio companies and foreign currency gains recognized in connection with a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus entity with a different functional currency in fiscal year 2020 as compared to foreign currency losses recognized in fiscal year 2019 partially offset by higher pension related costs recognized during fiscal year 2020 including a settlement loss of 103 million for the termination of the us pension plan as compared to fiscal year 2019 

income taxes income tax expense was 818 million for fiscal year 2020 an increase of 318 million compared to 500 million for fiscal year 2019 our effective tax rate was 183 for fiscal year 2020 compared to 165 for fiscal year 2019 the increase in our effective tax rate in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period was primarily due to the recognition of 206 million of net operating loss deferred tax assets due to foreign finance structure changes in 2019 partially offset by state tax benefits from amended state tax returns and higher tax benefits from stockbased compensation deductions in 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

revenue and operating income 

the following tables present consolidated revenue by type and by reportable segment 





the following table presents operating income by reportable segment 



the following presents and discusses our consolidated results by each of our reportable segments 

rms 



rms revenue increased 174 million or 33 due primarily to higher research model services revenue and higher research model product revenue in china research model services benefited from a large government contract in the is business and strong client demand in the gems business resulting from increased research and development activity conducted across biotechnology and academic institutional clients partially offsetting these increases were the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower research model product revenue outside of china particularly from large biopharmaceutical clients 

rms operating income decreased 26 million or 19 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 249 a decrease of 14 from 263 for the corresponding period in 2018 operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses which included the following a 22 million charge recorded within selling general and administrative costs in fiscal year 2019 in connection with the modification of the option to purchase the remaining 8 equity interest in vital river increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases higher severance charges in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives and facility expansions primarily in china in addition operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower operating income margins on the aforementioned large government contract and lower sales volume for research models outside of china 

dsa 



dsa revenue increased 3021 million or 229 due primarily to the recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research which contributed 1237 million and 730 million respectively to service revenue growth additionally service revenue increased in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from biotechnology clients and increased pricing of services these increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

dsa operating income increased 313 million or 138 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 dsa operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 160 a decrease of 13 from 173 for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase to operating income was primarily attributable to contributions from our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research this increase was partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses which included the following increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases increased investments related to facility expansions higher severance charges in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives and higher amortization of intangible assets and acquisition and integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 

manufacturing 



manufacturing revenue increased 356 million or 83 due primarily to higher demand for endotoxin products bioburden products and services and species identification services in the microbial solutions business and higher service revenue in the biologics business partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

manufacturing operating income increased 92 million or 68 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 313 a decrease of 04 from 317 for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase to operating income was due primarily to the increase in revenue this increase was partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses which included the following increased investments in process improvements to further enhance microbial solutions’ operating efficiency increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases and increased investments related to facility expansions primarily in biologics and certain site consolidation costs these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 

unallocated corporate 



unallocated corporate costs consist of selling general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated corporate costs of 181 million or 108 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 is related to an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisition activity and costs related to the remediation of the unauthorized access into our information systems costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 71 a decrease of 04 from 75 for the corresponding period in 2018 

interest income interest income which represents earnings on cash cash equivalents and time deposits was 15 million and 08 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase of 07 million was primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2019 as compared to 2018 

interest expense interest expense for fiscal year 2019 was 609 million a decrease of 29 million or 45 compared to 638 million for fiscal year 2018 the decrease was due primarily to a foreign currency gain recognized in connection with a debtrelated foreign exchange forward contract and lower debt issuance costs incurred compared to the corresponding period in 2018 partially offset by higher interest expense from increased debt to fund our recent acquisitions 

other income net other income net was 123 million for fiscal year 2019 a decrease of 10 million or 73 compared to 133 million for fiscal year 2018 the decrease was due to higher foreign currency losses recognized in connection with a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus entity with a different functional currency compared to the corresponding period in 2018 and higher pensionrelated costs as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 partially offset by higher net gains on our venture capital investments and our life insurance policy investments compared to the corresponding period in 2018 

income taxes income tax expense was 500 million for fiscal year 2019 a decrease of 45 million compared to 545 million for fiscal year 2018 our effective tax rate was 165 for fiscal year 2019 compared to 193 for fiscal year 2018 the decrease in our effective tax rate in the 2019 period compared to the 2018 period was primarily due to recognizing a 206 million deferred tax asset in fiscal year 2019 for net operating losses expected to be utilized in the future due to changes in our international financing structure 

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs capital expansion acquisitions and to pay our debt lease venture capital investment and pension obligations our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations supplemented by longterm borrowings based on our current business plan we believe that our existing funds when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future as previously discussed in our section on the covid19 pandemic impacts 

the following table presents our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



borrowings 

on march 26 2018 we amended and restated our 165 billion credit facility which extended the maturity date and provided for a 7500 million term loan and a 155 billion multicurrency revolving facility credit facility the term loan facility matures in 19 quarterly installments with the last installment due march 26 2023 the revolving facility matures on march 26 2023 and requires no scheduled payment before that date on october 23 2019 we prepaid 5000 million of the term loan with proceeds from a 5000 million unregistered private offering see 2028 senior notes below additionally on november 4 2019 we further amended and restated the credit facility to increase the multicurrency revolving facility by 5000 million from 155 billion to 205 billion under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loan andor revolving facility by up to 10 billion in the aggregate 

on april 3 2018 we entered into an indenture base indenture with mufg union bank na to allow for senior notes offerings under supplemental indentures concurrently on april 3 2018 we entered into our first supplemental indenture and raised 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of 55 senior notes due in 2026 2026 senior notes in an unregistered offering under the terms of the first supplemental indenture interest on the 2026 senior notes is payable semiannually on april 1 and october 1 beginning on october 1 2018 on october 23 2019 we entered into our second supplemental indenture and raised an additional 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of 425 senior notes due in 2028 2028 senior notes in an unregistered offering under the terms of the second supplemental indenture interest on the 2028 senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 beginning on may 1 2020 

amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and both the 2026 senior notes and the 2028 senior notes were as follows 



the interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving facility under the credit facility are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of 1 the prime rate 2 the federal funds rate plus 050 or 3 the onemonth adjusted libor rate plus 10 or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 to limit our foreign currency exposure related to a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus euro functional currency entity under the credit facility 

the acquisition of hemacare on january 3 2020 for 3798 million in cash was funded through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our credit facility under the multicurrency revolving facility 

the acquisition of distributed bio on december 31 2020 fiscal year 2021 for approximately 83 million in cash was funded through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our credit facility under the multicurrency revolving facility

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 26 2020 our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by 96 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi during fiscal year 2020 the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi japanese yen and brazilian real 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expenses which will decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the va lue of the nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2020 our revenue would 

have increased by 961 million and our operating income would have increased by 04 million if the us dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit our foreign currency exposure related to both intercompany loans and a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus euro functional currency entity under our credit facility refer to note 14 “foreign currency contracts” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding these types of forward contracts

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp which is able to support our clients from target identification through nonclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

the development of new drugs requires a steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10 to 15 years up to 20 billion excluding time costs and exploration of between 10000 and 15000 drug molecules to produce a single food and drug administration fdaapproved drug 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4 to 6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development rd timelines 

development activities which follow and which can take up to 7 to 10 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the nonclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro nonanimal typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to establish drug safety prior to and in support of human clinical trials 

for over 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services which now encompasses the broader earlystage drug research process we are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in earlystage drug research in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients’ discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy because of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio  we are the only large global cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we can collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage and enables our clients to make critical drug development decisions more quickly we understand our clients’ therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

pharmaceutical manufacturing support portfolio we also offer a portfolio of products services and solutions that supports the process development scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry we provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products in particular we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods which provide the highest testing quality enhance productivity and reduce cycle time 

deep scientific expertis e we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities including biomarkers biologics medicinal chemistry in vitro screening in vivo pharmacology immunology pathology biologics process development testing microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain independently we continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients’ internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of disease focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology respiratory bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular otology ophthalmology and cns in the 

areas of functional expertise it includes synthetic and medicinal chemistry cell line development in vitro and in vivo assay development screening nonclinical imaging structural biology process chemistry reproductive and general toxicology safety pharmacology veterinary pathology bioanalysis scale up and formulation development cell and gene therapy drug abuse liability and medical device testing we also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint 

commitment to animal welfare  we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3rs” initiative replacement reduction and refinement as researchers we are responsible to our clients our animals and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work closely with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support  we maintain scientific rigor and highquality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity and quality these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible and integrated infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff while ensuring the conduct of effective quality research for their projects we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner  we believe there is an important advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo and in vitro services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work they frequently chose to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlystage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals provision of data in sponsorspecific formats for data warehousing needs accelerated reporting reduced standard reporting timelines and industryleading standard exchange of nonclinical data send capabilities a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

our clients’ rd needs continue to evolve these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies we also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio 

we believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to 

reassess their core differentiators from rd to commercialization and which aspects of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes they will choose to outsource we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as larger pharmaceutical clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure by partnering with a cro like charles river they can take advantage of efficiencies in their earlystage research activities that can result in months or years saved in getting a drug to market in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical rd business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time  three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship because of this strategy we have been successfully renewing the majority of our strategic partnerships 

the evolving biopharmaceutical rd business model coupled with a robust funding environment have also led to the emergence of a significant number of new biotechnology companies in recent years that are discovering innovative new therapies we believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff 

our strategic imperatives are centered around our intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth enhance our operating efficiency and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment which we believe will collectively enable us to maximize value for our shareholders 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions such as our acquisitions of ctl international citoxlab in april 2019 and hemacare in january 2020 are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we believe the acquisition of citoxlab enhanced our position as a leading global early stage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum further we believe the acquisition of hemacare enhances our ability to provide a comprehensive cell therapy solution from discovery through commercialization which we believe will enhance our clients’ efficiency and accelerate their speedtomarket we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital 

in addition to conventional mergers and acquisitions our longterm strategy includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broadbased portfolio of products and services in particular our focus has been to drive differentiation through technologies that enhance the speed to develop a clinical candidate and allow biopharmaceutical companies to make earlier gonogo decisions among other arrangements these relationships may include entering into license agreements strategic partnerships or joint ventures that will allow us to access cuttingedge or nascent technologies with a modest investment component our ability to thoroughly assess these nascent technologies and market opportunities may later result in an acquisition 

we also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on earlystage companies through these partnerships and close relationships we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery safety assessment and biologics testing thus we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

clients 

our clients consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and industrial chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2019  no single commercial 

client accounted for more than 2 of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 10 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio because of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients’ planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada asia pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of earlystage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients’ global and sitespecific needs 

our gotomarket approach employs a number of sales and marketing strategies including dedicated sales teams for each of our major lines of business we also maintain several sales specialists that either have specific technical expertise often degreed scientists or cover unique markets 

in addition to our field sales teams and related specialists we also have a team of alliance managers who are organized by key client within our market segments global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our clients benefit by additional support from a combination of technical specialists with specific scientific and therapeutic area expertise we also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines such as in our manufacturing businesses 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales and business development teams who work in north america europe and asia in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters hosting webinars and seminars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with digital marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales and business development teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain client engagement digital experience inbound client support technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients’ routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity nonclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

competition 

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 



 industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care imperative hci which is directed by our global animal welfare and training group the goal of hci is to ensure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health research animal behavioral management programs and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro assays we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare and the 3rs as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we also partner with clients to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we maintain a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we fund scholarships for training in laboratory animal science provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal science field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees 

as of december 28 2019 prior to the acquisition of hemacare we had approximately 17100 employees including approximately 1900 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils employee representative groups andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 1287 million  10 billion and 654 million  respectively as of december 28 2019 prior to the acquisition of hemacare as compared to 1065 million 9008 million and 744 million respectively as of december 29 2018  related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client’s intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in december 28 2019 backlog may be completed in 2020 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty 

payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens bred for use in research as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as europe china and japan for the care handling and use of regulated species and birds bred for research all of our dsa and rms facilities in north america and europe are either accredited or in the process of initiating accreditation by aaalac international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the scientific operational and quality process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity under newly issued guidance we have established a formal program to manage regulatory and client expectations regarding data integrity within our regulated businesses although each business has a different impact on patient safety all are expected to generate data with integrity we recognize the importance of generating quality reliable sustainable data and have instituted several processes and established a global governance team with oversight responsibilities for our data integrity compliance plans to ensure we are consistent in our approach to ensure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

at a global level retention of data and controls for electronic systems proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies we also have controls in place such as quality manuals policies and procedures work instructions document control processes training quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel validated computerized systems and archiving requirements within businesses procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs and 

to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation as appropriate under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 global regulatory compliance programs are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance our compliance programs are also managed by global quality systems such as vendor supplier programs quality management systems and global computer system validation within each regulated business we have established quality assurance units qaus responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing our data integrity compliance program ensures that management has proper oversight with qaus of our electronic records inclusive of quality function reviews of our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on innovative technologies to enhance our portfolio with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions that are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties and the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future documents we file with the sec 

a reduction in demand may adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their rd budgets and consequentially our business as well 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of rd and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on lowering rd costs per drug candidate fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the rd budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services rd budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations including potential drug pricing legislation available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 

for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing rd budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

further our research products operations are structured to produce particular blood products based on customers’ existing demand and perceived potential changes in demand for these products sudden or unexpected changes in demand for these products could have an adverse impact on our profitability increasing demand could harm relationships with customers if we are unable to alter production capacity or purchase products from other suppliers to fill orders adequately this could result in a decrease in overall revenue and profits decreases in demand may require us to make sizable investments to restructure operations away from declining products to the production of new products lack of access to sufficient capital or lack of adequate time to properly respond to such a change in demand could result in declining revenue and profits as customers transfer to other suppliers 

a reduction or delay in government funding of rd may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue predominantly in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast we also sell directly to the nih and these other agencies government funding of rd is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals included reduced allocations to government agencies that fund rd activities government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund rd activities or nih funding may not be directed towards projects and studies that require the use of our products and services both of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems including as a result of the spread of diseases such as coronavirus export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes tariffs international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other ordinary course or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could materially harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms while we continue to take steps to find alternative supply channels and lock in supply with preferred sources through multiyear andor minimum commitment contracts such mitigating efforts may not prove successful at ensuring a steady and timely supply or may require us to pay significantly higher prices for such products 

during periods of global shortage or restrictions on the transportation of products in addition limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from nonpreferred vendors 

further our research products business depends on the availability of appropriate donors if the level of donor participation declines we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to maintain profitability of the research products business for example regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply including coronavirus could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors due to any pandemic epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our research products business operates the portion of the public that typically donates may be unable or unwilling to donate thereby significantly reducing the availability of research products upon which we rely in addition even if suspected diseases prove to be no more virulent than other more common disease the heightened fear among the public resulting from widespread media coverage may result in a dramatic decline in donations 

we have in the past experienced and in the future could experience an unauthorized access into our information systems 

we operate large and complex information systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such information systems to steal data or disrupt the systems while we have taken measures to protect them from intrusion in march 2019 we detected evidence that an unauthorized third party who we believe was well resourced and highly sophisticated accessed certain of our information systems and copied data we worked with a leading cyber security firm to assist in our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities our investigation indicated that the affected information included client information 

in december 2019 we disclosed that we had completed our remediation of the incident identified in march of 2019 while we have implemented additional security safeguards including 

 such efforts may not be successful in which case we could suffer significant harm 

our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from the studies we conduct in the event the confidentiality of such information is compromised whether by unauthorized access or other breaches we could be exposed to significant harm including termination of customer contracts damage to our customer relationships damage to our reputation and potential legal claims from customers employees and other parties in addition we may face investigations by government regulators and agencies as a result of a breach 

further we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions for example we are required to comply with the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 and imposes heightened obligations and enhanced penalties for noncompliance including up to four percent 4 of global revenue the cost of compliance and the potential for fines and penalties for noncompliance with gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations also the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act ccpa which became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa creates new transparency requirements and grants california residents several new rights with regard their personal information failure to comply with the ccpa may result in among other things significant civil penalties and injunctive relief or potential statutory or actual damages we have made changes to and investments in our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate 

changes to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex regulations additionally while collecting research products from donors we may collect use disclose maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure storage transmission or confidentiality of patientidentifiable health information 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client’s facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection and liability for damages to infected persons 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification the third party may refuse to fulfill its indemnification obligation or may be unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require us to restart the applicable colonies and would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements 

further many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems that are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning letter from the fda based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for glp or cgmp requirements that are not addressed to the regulatory monitoring authorities’ satisfaction could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in recent years fda has issued guidance that now requires submissions to be presented in a format that conforms with the fda’s send standardization for exchange of nonclinical data standards that apply to our clients’ nda and ind submissions and require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews accordingly our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send notwithstanding some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community noncompliance with any of these expectations 

could lead to official action by a government authority damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our research products business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by federal state and local governments in the us and in the other countries in which it operates this business requires us to obtain many licenses permits authorizations approvals certificates and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate federal state and local regulations change often and new regulations are frequently adopted changes in the regulations could require us to change the way in which we operate our business and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant 

our donor collection centers are registered with the fda and the fda periodically conducts inspections of those facilities and operations at the conclusion of each inspection the fda provides us with a list of observations of regulatory issues discovered during the inspection that could result in additional regulatory action failure to comply with the regulations of the fda could result in sanctions andor remedies and have a material adverse effect on us 

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently influenced outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping our customers navigate these regulatory processes accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies including the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures that utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted healthcare reform legislation the patient protection and affordable care act aca which includes provisions impacting drug manufacturers such as 1 the expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 the expansion of the medicaid program 3 the enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 the imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices in addition the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 repeals the aca’s individual health insurance mandate which is considered a key component of the aca since the aca and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations the ultimate effects of this legislation are unclear on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect rd expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on rd 

while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level or in laws and regulations in effect in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or have business relationships may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients furthermore modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a materially adverse impact on us our suppliers or our clients 

we bear financial risk for contracts that may be terminated or reduced in scope underpriced subject to cost overruns or delayed 

many of our agreements including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

our counterparties including our clients who are competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 if a counterparty terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

furthermore many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may be adversely impacted 

during the last two decades we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and hemacare we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 



 if an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses including specific product lines and service offerings to determine whether any divestitures are appropriate any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line or service offering and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 28 2019  the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was 22 billion  

our business is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely impact our results foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the us could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar resulting in a reduction in the amount of revenue and cash flow and an increase in the amount of expenses that we recognize and causing fluctuations in reported financial results we also carry foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where we conduct business for example certain contracts are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary’s functional currency while our financial results are reported in us dollars the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency during consolidation these results are translated into us dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results moreover as exchange rates vary revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity 

other risks associated with our international business include 

 these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the fcpa and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their thirdparty intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the 

purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 

we depend on our customers and facilities for the continued operation of our business while we maintain disaster recovery plans they might not adequately protect us despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events these events including terrorist attack a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a disease including coronavirus hurricanes fire floods and ice and snow storms could result in damage to and closure of our or our customers’ facilities or the infrastructure on which such facilities rely such disruptions could significant delays in the shipments of our products reduce our capacity to provide services eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities result in our customers’ inability to pay for our products or services and ultimately result in the loss of revenue and clients although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our customers could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance 

failure to comply with us state local or international environmental health and safety laws and regulations including regulations issued by the occupational safety and health administration environmental protection agency nuclear regulatory agency and department of transportation could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure and have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business 

we are subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety including laws and regulations relating to the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties andor other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us that may be costly 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research which could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from nonclinical to clinical studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro technologies such that employ human biospecimens stem cell technologies and genome editing 

it is our strategy to explore these in vitro technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated for example our discovery and safety assessment businesses have programs to evaluate the utility of induced pluripotent stems cells advanced in vitro models artificial intelligence and machine learning in discovery and preclinical development successful commercialization of alternatives to traditional research models may not be sufficient to fully offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services that we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and a significant amount are mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our 

annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our thirdparty service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

as of december 28 2019  we had 19 billion of debt our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 9 “longterm debt and finance lease obligations” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the interest rate on our 23 billion credit facility credit facility which matures in fiscal year 2023 is linked to libor as of december 28 2019  amounts outstanding on our credit facility were 1938 million on our term loan and 6761 million on our revolving credit facility for which there is an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 205 billion  in 2017 the financial conduct authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop if libor ceases to exist the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our debt in the future may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity while we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phaseout or replacement of libor such efforts may not prove successful in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

costs increasing more rapidly than market prices could reduce profitability 

the cost of collecting processing and testing blood products has risen significantly in recent years and will likely continue to increase these cost increases are related to new and improved testing procedures increased regulatory requirements related to blood safety and higher staff and supply costs related to collecting and processing blood products competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating margins some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable sales costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete for business with other cros and blood product and therapeutic services companies as well as internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 



 if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies which are targets for each other and for large pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

changes in us and international tax law 

in 2017 significant us tax law changes from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 us tax reform went into effect and reduced the us federal statutory tax rate broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits limited the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense and allowed for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us with a 100 federal dividends received deduction prospectively in addition us tax reform required a onetime transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings several of the new provisions enacted as part of us tax reform still require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue service irs and treasury department these or other changes in us tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows 

additionally the oecd the european commission ec and individual taxing jurisdictions have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations the oecd released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of rules to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany luxembourg netherlands and the uk in addition the oecd and ec and individual countries are examining how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from enacted laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments france and the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flows and effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 



lot release testing of medical devices injectable drugs food beverages and home and beauty products primarily through our microbial solutions business or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our biologics business which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials and 

 while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore either we or a party required to indemnify us may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses the expansion and ongoing implementation of the systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including information security assessment and remediation data conversion network and system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing errors and accounting errors 

the failure to successfully obtain maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to our intellectual property rights could adversely affect us 

many of our services products and processes rely on intellectual property in some cases that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to us sometimes exclusively to protect our intellectual property rights we primarily rely upon trade secret law confidentiality agreements and policies invention assignments and other contractual arrangements along with patent copyright and trademark laws existing laws of certain countries outside of the united states in which we operate offer only limited protection and these are subject to change at any time in addition the agreements upon which we rely to protect our intellectual property might be breached or might not be fully enforceable our intellectual property rights might not prevent our competitors from independently developing intellectual property that is similar to or duplicative of ours also enforcing our intellectual property rights might also require substantial time money and oversight and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights if we are unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to our intellectual property if we are unable to prevent attempted infringement against our intellectual property or if we are unable to defend against claims that we are infringing on another party’s intellectual property we could be adversely affected these adverse effects could include us having to abandon alter or delay the deployment of products services or processes that rely on such intellectual property having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that we seek to use and having to pay damages fines court costs and attorneys fees in connection with intellectual property litigation 

further the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new 

products and services to our clients our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may adversely affect our business 

the first stage of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” took place on january 31 2020 when the uk left the european union and entered a transition phase during the transition phase the uk needs to negotiate the terms of its future trading and other relationships with the european union the scope and timing of these negotiations have created significant uncertainty and continue to do so the uk prime minister has said that a trade agreement needs to be reached by december 31 2020 there is currently no mechanism to automatically extend the transition period but there is a possibility that the transition period may be extended by agreement between the uk and the european union 

given the continuing uncertainty concerning the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union including the possibility that there may still be no negotiated agreement despite the results of the december 2019 general election we have formed a committee comprised of senior managers across our business functions to address key risks among four main themes 1 trade and customs 2 employees and immigration 3 strategy and business planning and 4 legislative changes that committee will continue until the situation is clarified 

in the absence of a trade deal in the short to medium term the uk’s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization additionally the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the european union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure these changes to the trading relationship between the uk and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period although we are undertaking efforts to mitigate those risks within our control a failure to adequately mitigate such risks or other factors outside our control could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer and president since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades while we entered into an employment agreement with mr foster in 2018 most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may be adversely impacted 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process that identifies successors and potential talent needs there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by the risks discussed above as well as 



 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment

we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs sites and leases added to the portfolio by way of acquisition are integrated into our overall real estate strategy in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations

business trends 

the demand for our products and services continued to increase meaningfully in fiscal year 2019 our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally small and midsize biotechnology clients continued to be the primary driver of revenue growth as these clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2019 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros like charles river and biotechnology 

companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our full service earlystage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions and new business opportunities in fiscal year 2019 as clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

the primary result of these trends was robust revenue growth within our dsa reportable segment in fiscal year 2019 particularly from biotechnology clients in addition to the acquisition of citoxlab in april 2019 increased demand and pricing contributed to robust safety assessment revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 our safety assessment facilities remained well utilized in fiscal year 2019 recent acquisitions most notably citoxlab and mpi added modest amounts of available capacity to accommodate increasing client demand we believe the breadth and depth of our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us as biotechnology funding remains robust and our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research to bring innovative new therapies to market they are evaluating outsourcing more of their research programs such as discovery services we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities to provide clients with a comprehensive portfolio that enables them to start working with us at the earliest stages of the discovery process we have accomplished this through acquisitions including citoxlab’s discovery services kws biotest in january 2018 and brains online in august 2017 and through adding cuttingedge capabilities to our discovery toolkit through partnerships such as distributed bio bitbio and fios genomics in fiscal year 2019 demand in our discovery services business also increased meaningfully driven by biotechnology clients as many of these clients either initiated or continued to work with us on integrated programs and other projects our efforts to enhance our sales strategies provide clients with flexible partnering models and become a trusted scientific partner for our clients’ earlystage programs have been successful and enabled us to attract new clients demand from large biopharmaceutical companies also increased these clients continue to have significant internal discovery capabilities on which they can choose to rely in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to increasingly outsource more work to us we must continue to demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients’ drug discovery processes 

demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2019 demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions our biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market to support this increased demand we continued to expand the capacity of our biologics business 

demand for our research models and services increased in fiscal year 2019 driven by strong demand for research models in china higher revenue for research model services and improved pricing demand for research models in china continued to be robust in fiscal year 2019 as clients in this growing market continue to value our highquality research models demand for research models services also improved in fiscal year 2019 particularly for our is and gems businesses the is business further benefited from a fiveyear 957 million contract from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases or niaid that commenced in september 2018 the continued effect of the consolidation of internal infrastructure within our large biopharmaceutical clients and a longerterm trend towards more efficient use of research models has led to reduced demand for research models outside of china we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and the rms business will continue to be an important source of cash flow generation for us in addition in january 2020 we enhanced the rms business’ growth profile and portfolio of critical research tools that we are able to supply through the acquisition of hemacare a premier provider of humanderived cellular products used in cell therapies 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 26 billion compared to 23 billion in fiscal year 2018  the 2019 increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was 3551 million  or 157  and was primarily due to both growth in our dsa and manufacturing segments as discussed in the above “business trends” section as well as the recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research partially offset by the negative effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which decreased revenue by 361 million  or 15  when compared to the corresponding period in 2018  

in fiscal year 2019  our operating income and operating income margin were 3512 million and 134  respectively compared with 3314 million and 146  respectively in fiscal year 2018  the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenues discussed above and contributions from our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research partially offset by the following which decreased the operating income margin increased amortization expense and costs related to our recent acquisition activity increased costs incurred in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives continued investments to support future growth of the businesses which includes increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases and facility expansions primarily in the rms and biologics businesses and companywide it and 

infrastructure projects offsetting the decreases in operating income margin were the realization of improved volume mix and pricing across our products and services portfolio as well as the impact of recent productivity initiatives across all businesses 

net income attributable to common shareholders increased to 2520 million in fiscal year 2019  from 2264 million in the corresponding period of 2018  the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of 256 million was primarily due to the increase in operating income described above as well as a lower income tax rate due to recognizing a 206 million deferred tax asset in fiscal year 2019 for net operating losses expected to be utilized in the future due to changes in the company’s international financing structure 

during fiscal year 2019  our cash flows from operations was 4809 million compared with 4411 million for fiscal year 2018  the increase was primarily driven by the increase to net income and the favorable timing of vendor and supplier payments compared to the same period in 2018 partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities specifically related to the timing of net contract balances from contracts with customers collectively trade receivables net deferred revenue and customer contract deposits increases in inventory levels in response to customer demand and higher compensation payments compared to the prior year period 

on october 23 2019 we issued 5000 million of 425 senior notes due in 2028 2028 senior notes in an unregistered offering interest on the 2028 senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 beginning on may 1 2020 net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes of approximately 494 million  along with available cash was used to prepay 5000 million of our term loan under our credit facility additionally on november 4 2019 we amended and restated our credit facility by increasing the amount of our multicurrency revolving facility by 5000 million from 155 billion to 205 billion under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loan andor revolving facility by up to 10 billion in the aggregate 

in march 2019 we detected unauthorized access into portions of our information systems and commenced an investigation into the incident coordinated with us federal law enforcement and leading cyber security experts and promptly implemented a comprehensive containment and remediation plan in december 2019 we completed our remediation of this incident the financial impact of the march 2019 event is not material refer to part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k for further details on the results of the remediation efforts 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the application of our accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

accounting standard codification topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” asc 606 became effective for us on december 31 2017 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption for contracts that were modified before the effective date we reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price in accordance with the practical expedient which did not have a material effect on the cumulative impact of adopting asc 606 the reported results for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 reflect the application of asc 606 guidance while the historical results for fiscal year 2017 was prepared under the guidance of asc 605 “revenue recognition” asc 605 there is no material difference in the reporting of revenue during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 in accordance with asc 606 when compared to fiscal year 2017 in accordance with asc 605 

revenue is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer “transaction price” 

to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration is included in the transaction price if in our judgment it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available sales value add and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue 

when determining the transaction price of a contract an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance resulting in a significant financing component generally we do not extend payment terms beyond one year applying the practical expedient we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components 

contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations for such arrangements the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation we determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations 

contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations generally when contract modifications create new performance obligations the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively when contract modifications change existing performance obligations the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue on a cumulative catchup basis 

product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer we generally measure our progress using either costtocost input method or righttoinvoice output method we use the costtocost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract generally related to fixed fee service contracts under the costtocost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation the costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours allocation of overhead costs research model costs and subcontractor costs revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the righttoinvoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or timebased increments such as samples tested or labor hours incurred revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date during fiscal year 2019  16 billion  or approximately 60 of our total revenue recognized  26 billion  is dsa service revenue transferred over time 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected 

future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

our valuation allowance increased by 3002 million from 98 million as of december 29 2018 to 3100 million as of december 28 2019  the increase is primarily related to the recognition of 3155 million of net operating loss deferred tax assets due to changes in our financing structure 2949 million of which we do not believe is more likely than not to be utilized 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as us tax reform us tax reform made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to i reducing the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 ii requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries iii generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iv requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations v eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and changing how existing amt credits can be realized vi subjecting certain foreign earnings to us taxation through base erosion antiabuse tax beat and global intangible lowtaxed income gilti vii creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense viii changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and ix modifying the officer’s compensation limitation 

our accounting for the elements of us tax reform is complete we have made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense see note 11 “income taxes” for further discussion 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

in our recent acquisitions customer relationship intangible assets also referred to as client relationships have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired to determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model a commonly accepted valuation technique which includes the following key assumptions projections of cash flows from the acquired entities which included future revenue growth rates operating income margins and customer attrition rates as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the acquired entities’ weighted average cost of capital the value of client relationships acquired were 1346 million for citoxlab in fiscal year 2019 and 2649 million for mpi research in fiscal year 2018 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from 

projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset no impairments were recognized during 2019  2018 or 2017  

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in fiscal years 2019  2018 and 2017  we elected to perform the quantitative first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2019  2018 and 2017 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

in fiscal 2017 we recognized 177 million of asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on the rms facility in frederick maryland in connection with our 2017 rms restructuring initiatives 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this 

amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations a 25 basis point change in the discount rate changes the projected benefit obligation by approximately 20 million for all our plans 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in fiscal year 2019  new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2018 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 28 million as of december 28 2019  in fiscal year 2018  new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2017 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 17 million as of december 29 2018  

on january 31 2019 we commenced the process to terminate t he charles river laboratories inc pension plan  us pension plan and expect to complete the termination process during the second half of fiscal year 2020  as part of the planned termination we rebalanced assets to better match the characteristics of the liabilities at december 28 2019  the us pension plan has a benefit obligation of 944 million and plan assets of 912 million  the benefit obligation has been valued at the amount expected to be required to settle the obligations assumptions utilized considered the portion of obligations expected to be settled through participant acceptance of lump sum payments or annuities and the cost to purchase annuities which are subject to change upon actual plan settlement increasing the us pension plan’s obligations to reflect the expected settlement value resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately 6 million  which was recorded within other comprehensive income as part of the annual revaluation for fiscal year 2019 upon settlement of the benefit obligation pension losses currently deferred and recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets will be reclassified to other expense net within our consolidated statement of income as of december 28 2019 we had unrecognized losses related to the us pension plan of approximately 14 million  

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and rsus to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments stockbased compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value adjusted for forfeitures when they occur over the requisite service period 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of psus is estimated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change

rms 



rms revenue increased 174 million  or 33  due primarily to higher research model services revenue and higher research model product revenue in china research model services benefited from a large government contract in the is business and strong client demand in the gems business resulting from increased research and development activity conducted across biotechnology and academic institutional clients partially offsetting these increases were the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower research model product revenue outside of china particularly from large biopharmaceutical clients 

rms operating income decreased 26 million  or 19  compared to the corresponding period in 2018  rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 249  a decrease of 14 from 263 for the corresponding period in 2018  operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses which included the following a 22 million charge recorded within selling general and administrative costs in fiscal year 2019 in connection with the modification of the option to purchase the remaining 8 equity interest in vital river increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases higher severance charges in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives and facility expansions primarily in china in addition operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower operating income margins on the aforementioned large government contract and lower sales volume for research models outside of china 

dsa 



dsa revenue increased 3021 million  or 229  due primarily to the recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research which contributed 1237 million and 730 million respectively to service revenue growth additionally service revenue increased in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from biotechnology clients and increased pricing of services these increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

was partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses which included the following increased investments in process improvements to further enhance microbial solutions’ operating efficiency increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases and increased investments related to facility expansions primarily in biologics and certain site consolidation costs these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2019 compared to 2018  

unallocated corporate 



unallocated corporate costs consist of selling general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated corporate costs of 181 million  or 108  compared to the corresponding period in 2018 is related to an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisition activity and costs related to the remediation of the unauthorized access into our information systems costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 71  a decrease of 04 from 75 for the corresponding period in 2018  

interest income interest income which represents earnings on cash cash equivalents and time deposits was 15 million and 08 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase of 07 million was primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2019 as compared to 2018

manufacturing 



manufacturing revenue increased 455 million  or 119  due primarily to higher demand for endotoxin products and species identification services in the microbial solutions business higher service revenue in the biologics business higher product revenue in the avian business and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by the absence of 18 million of service revenue related to the cdmo business 

manufacturing operating income increased 123 million  or 99  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 was 317  a decrease of 06 from 323 for the corresponding period in 2017  the increase to operating income was due primarily to the increase in revenue this increase was partially offset by increased costs to support the growth of the company including increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increase facility expansions primarily in microbial solutions and biologics and increased investments in technology to support research and development efforts primarily in microbial solutions increased costs are recorded in cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses and these higher costs decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 

unallocated corporate 



the increase in unallocated corporate costs of 359 million  or 270  is consistent with the allocated selling general and administrative expense increases discussed above and are primarily related to an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses and an increase in costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisitions to support the growth of the company costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 was 75  an increase of 03 from 72 for the corresponding period in 2017

cash flows 

the following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by cash flows from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for 1 noncash operating items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes gains on venture capital investments and divestiture and impairment charges as well as 2 changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations for fiscal year 2019  compared to fiscal year 2018  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations net of income taxes 

and the favorable timing of vendor and supplier payments compared to the same period in 2018 partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities specifically related to the timing of net contract balances from contracts with customers collectively trade receivables net deferred revenue and customer contract deposits increases in inventory levels in response to customer demand and higher compensation payments compared to the prior year period the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations and positive changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from an increase in our deferred revenue primarily due to a onetime upfront payment received in connection with a strategic agreement an increase in customer contract deposits as well as improved collections of our receivables

as of december 28 2019  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk promulgated under the exchange act except as disclosed below 

venture capital investments 

we invest in several venture capital funds that invest in startup companies primarily in the life sciences industry our total commitment to the funds as of december 28 2019 was 1284 million  of which we funded 803 million through december 28 2019  refer to note 6 “venture capital investments and other investments” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

letters of credit 

our offbalance sheet commitments related to our outstanding letters of credit as of december 28 2019 were 75 million  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 28 2019  our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by 87 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi during fiscal year 2019  the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the canadian dollar british pound hungarian forint euro and chinese yuan renminbi 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expenses which will decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2019  our revenue would have increased by 905 million and our operating income would have increased by 20 million  if the us dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit our foreign currency exposure related to both intercompany loans and a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus euro functional currency entity under our credit facility refer to note 14 “foreign currency contracts” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding these types of forward contracts

avian vaccine services    we are the global leader for the supply of spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens spf chicken embryos are used by vaccine producers as selfcontained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material for human and veterinary vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is performed under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence with several spf egg production facilities in the us and contracted production capabilities in hungary we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the us which provides inhouse quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively in addition we believe we can improve and augment drug discovery and earlystage development effectiveness by coordinating the dialog between large pharmaceutical biotechnology academic and nongovernmental organizations and venture capitalists separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio    we are the only large global cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage and enables our clients to make critical drug development decisions more quickly we understand our clients therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

pharmaceutical manufacturing support portfolio we also offer a portfolio of products services and solutions that supports the process development scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry we provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products in particular we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods which provide the highest testing quality enhance productivity and reduce cycle time 

deep scientific expertis e   we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities including biomarkers biologics medicinal chemistry in vitro  screening in vivo  pharmacology immunology pathology biologics process development testing microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain independently we continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of disease focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology respiratory bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular otology ophthalmology and cns in the areas of functional expertise it includes synthetic and medicinal chemistry cell line development in vitro  and in vivo  assay development screening nonclinical imaging structural biology process chemistry reproductive and general toxicology safety pharmacology veterinary pathology bioanalysis scale up and formulation development we also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need

where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint 

commitment to animal welfare  we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3rs” initiative replacement reduction and refinement as researchers we are responsible to our clients our animals and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support  we maintain scientific rigor and highquality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity and quality these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible and integrated infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff while ensuring the conduct of effective quality research for their projects we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner    we believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo  and in vitro  services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work they frequently chose to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlystage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals accelerated reporting and industryleading standard exchange of nonclinical data send capabilities a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies we also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio for example during the past year we were awarded a large multiyear contract in our rms segment with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid one of the nih’s largest institutes to manage niaid’s research model operations we also extended our longstanding collaboration with the michael j fox foundation for parkinson’s research mjff since 2011 we have worked together with mjff to accelerate the discovery of therapies for parkinson’s disease 

our clients research and development needs continue to evolve particularly with regard to larger biopharmaceutical companies these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic

outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure by partnering with a cro like charles river they can take advantage of scientific reporting efficiencies that can result in months or years saved in getting a drug to market in addition with one of the largest and most experienced send team in the industry we believe that our services quality and ability to navigate the complex world of electronic data for submission is an unmatched competitive advantage to be shared with all our clients in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time  three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship as a result of this strategy we have been successfully renewing the majority of our strategic partnerships 

we also believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services and integrated services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff 

we maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment as a result we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital for example in each of 2017 and 2018 we completed strategic acquisitions in august 2017 we acquired brains online bol a leading cro that provides critical data that advances novel therapeutics for the treatment of cns diseases in january 2018 we acquired kws a leading cro specializing in in vitro  and in vivo  discovery testing services for immunooncology and inflammatory and infectious diseases and in april 2018 we acquired mpi a premier nonclinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide 

in addition to conventional mergers and acquisitions our longterm strategy includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broadbased portfolio of products and services among other arrangements could include entering into a license agreement strategic partnership or joint venture which will allow us to access cuttingedge or nascent technologies with an investment component which ultimately may later become an acquisition for example in october 2018 we entered into an exclusive partnership with distributed bio inc a leader in the computational design and optimization of antibody platforms 

we are also partnering with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on earlystage companies through these partnerships and close relationships we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery safety assessment and biologics testing thus we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

clients 

our gotomarket approach employs a number of sales and marketing strategies including dedicated sales teams for each of our major lines of business we also maintain several sales specialists which either have specific technical expertise often degreed scientists or cover unique markets 

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and industrial chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic 

 10 

institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during   2018  no single commercial client accounted for more than 25 of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 6 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio because of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada asia pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 4 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

in addition to our fields sales teams and related specialists we also have a team of alliance managers who are organized by key client within our market segments global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our clients benefit by additional support from a combination of technical specialists with specific scientific and therapeutic area expertise we also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines such as in our manufacturing businesses 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales and business development teams who work in north america europe and asia in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters hosting webinars and seminars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with digital marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales and business development teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain client engagement digital experience inbound client support technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity nonclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of earlystage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition 

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments although the largest competitors within any segment vary we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 



 11 

 industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro  assays we also partner with clients to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we also maintain a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees 

as of december 29 2018  we had approximately 14700 employees including approximately 1600 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils employee representative groups andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 1065 million 9008 million and 744 million respectively as of december 29 2018  as compared to 968 million 5900 million and 469 million respectively as of december 30 2017  related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in   december 29 2018   backlog may be completed in 2019 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic 

 12 

decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens bred for use in research as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as europe china and japan for the care handling and use of regulated species and birds bred for research all of our dsa and rms facilities in north america and europe are either accredited or in the process of initiating accreditation by aaalac international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the scientific operational and quality process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity under newly issued guidance 

we have established a formal program to manage regulatory and client expectations regarding data integrity within our regulated businesses although each business has a different impact on patient safety all are expected to generate data with integrity we recognize the importance of generating quality reliable sustainable data and have instituted a number of processes to ensure we are consistent in our approach 

at a global level retention of data and controls for electronic systems proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies we also have controls in place such as quality manuals policies and procedures work instructions document control processes training quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel validated computerized systems and archiving requirements within businesses procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs working with our clients to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing 

 13 

and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation as appropriate under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 global compliance programs are managed by a dedicated group responsible for global regulatory affairs and compliance including internal assessment of quality programs and systems to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our clients’ expectations for quality and regulatory compliance to assure these compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qaus in each of our regulated businesses that require independent oversight the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing that studies that supports manufacturing 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the sec and the united states federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and other applicable laws rules and regulations each member of our board of directors other than mr foster who is also our chief executive officer is independent and has no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have established global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines to help ensure that our public disclosures including our periodic reports filed with the sec earnings releases and other written information that we disclose to the investment community are complete accurate and timely we continually monitor developments in the law and stock exchange regulations as well as overall corporate governance trends and intend to adopt new procedures consistent with such developments to the extent applicable and appropriate to our company copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at httpircrivercom  under the “investor relations  corporate governance” caption

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of research and development and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of 

 15 

pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations including potential drug pricing legislation available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue predominantly in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast we also sell directly to the nih and these other agencies government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard including with respect to how we process and report any breaches but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions for example we are required to comply with the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 and imposes heightened obligations and enhanced penalties for noncompliance including up to four percent 4 of global revenue the cost of compliance with the gdpr and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a violation of the gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations we have made changes to and investments in our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate changes to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex regulations 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales

if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for glp or cgmp requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd have increased their emphasis on the management of computerized systems to ensure data integrity new guidance related to the need for data integrity compliance programs have recently been released and we may require additional efforts for validation audit trail review and archiving activities to assure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance in addition the fda’s recently applicable send standardization for exchange of nonclinical data standards which apply to our clients’ nda and ind submissions require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews accordingly our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send notwithstanding some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community noncompliance with any of these expectations could lead to official action by a government authority damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in canada europe and asia failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted healthcare reform legislation the patient protection and affordable care act or the aca intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allowed implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices in may 2017 the us house of representatives voted to pass the american health care act the ahca which would repeal many provisions of the aca although the us senate considered but failed to pass the ahca and other comparable measures the us congress may consider further legislation to repeal or replace elements of the aca in addition the tax cuts and jobs act which president trump signed into law in december 2017 repeals the aca’s   individual health insurance mandate which is considered a key component of the aca since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations as well as from the incoming president and his administration we are uncertain as to the ultimate effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients furthermore modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a material impact on us or our clients 

 18 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past sixteen years we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

in april 2018 we acquired mpi research a nonclinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide this transaction was our largest acquisition since 2004 in february 2019 we  signed a binding offer to acquire citoxlab for €448 million  in cash or approximately 510 million  based on current exchange rates citoxlab is a nonclinical cro specializing in regulated safety assessment services nonregulated discovery services and medical device testing 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 



 19 

 in the event that an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses including specific product lines and service offerings these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line or service offering and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate and other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing 

 20 

operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 29 2018  the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was 19 billion  

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us our international revenue represented approximately onehalf of our total revenue in recent years we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 



 21 

 these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the fcpa and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their thirdparty intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

our facilities could be damaged or disrupted by natural disasters or other catastrophic events which could adversely affect our reputation financial position results of operations and cash flows  

while we have taken precautions to mitigate production and service interruptions at our global facilities a major catastrophe such as a hurricane tornado earthquake flood wildfire or other natural disaster or other unanticipated displacement at or near any of our facilities could result in physical damage to our properties including closure resulting in a prolonged interruption of our business a disruption resulting from any one of these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products reduce our capacity to provide services eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities and ultimately result in the loss of revenue and clients any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from nonclinical to clinical studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro   technologies such that employ human biospecimens stem cell technologies and genome editing 

it is our strategy to explore these in vitro  technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated for example our safety and assessment businesses have a program to evaluate the utility of induced pluripotent stems cells advanced in vitro  models “organonachip” technologies artificial intelligence and machine learning in preclinical development successful commercialization of alternatives to traditional research models may not be sufficient to fully offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and a significant amount are mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

as of december 29 2018  we had 17 billion   of debt in connection with our intended acquisition of citoxlab we anticipate increasing our debt to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price of approximately €448 million  in cash or approximately 510 million  based on current exchange rates our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial 

 22 

portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 9 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the drug discovery development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive 

the drug discovery nonclinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

 if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us and international tax law 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law significant us tax law changes us tax reform which reduced the us federal statutory tax rate broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits limited the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense and transitioned to a territorial tax system which allows for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us with a 100 federal dividends received deduction prospectively in addition us tax reform required a onetime transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings several of the new provisions enacted as part of us tax reform require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue 

 23 

service irs and treasury department these or other changes in us tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows 

we have substantial operations in canada ireland and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flows and effective tax rate 

the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany luxembourg netherlands and the uk future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

 while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that neither we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems the expansion and ongoing implementation of the systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of similar largescale systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

 24 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our clients our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may adversely affect our business 

the uk is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the european union “ brexit ” scheduled for march 29 2019 in november 2018 the uk and the european union agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement that sets out the terms of the uk’s departure including commitments on citizen rights after brexit a financial settlement from the uk and a transition period from march 29 2019 through december 31 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed on january 15 2019 the draft withdrawal agreement was rejected by the uk parliament creating significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the uk will leave the european union  

given the uncertainty concerning the terms of the uk’s departure from the eu including the possibility of no negotiated agreement we have formed a committee comprised of senior managers across our business functions to address the three main risks 1 trade and customs 2 employees and immigration and 3 strategy and business planning 

in the absence of a future trade deal the uk’s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization additionally the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the european union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure these changes to the trading relationship between the uk and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period  although efforts are being undertaken to mitigate for risks within our control other factors outside our control could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer and president since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades while we entered into an employment agreement with mr foster in 2018 most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process which identifies successors and potential talent needs there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

 25 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment

we track room utilization on an ongoing basis and depending on the needs of our clients at given times we may need to execute on contingent plans for expansion which average between six and fifteen months to complete 

we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations

recent acquisitions and divestiture 

our strategy is to augment internal growth of existing businesses with complementary acquisitions we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market our recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below 

on february 13 2019 we announced that we signed a binding offer to acquire citoxlab for €448 million  in cash or approximately 510 million  based on current exchange rates subject to customary closing adjustments citoxlab is a nonclinical cro specializing in regulated safety assessment services nonregulated discovery services and medical device testing with operations in europe and north america the proposed acquisition of citoxlab would further strengthen our position as the leading global earlystage cro by expanding our scientific portfolio and geographic footprint which would enhance our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum   the proposed transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019 subject to labor consultations regulatory requirements and customary closing 

 30 

conditions upon completion of the labor consultations citoxlab’s shareholders are expected to enter into a definitive purchase agreement the proposed acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through our existing revolving credit facility and cash in the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances we may be required to pay a termination fee of €182 million  this business is expected to be reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on april 3 2018 we acquired mpi research a nonclinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide the acquisition enhances our position as a leading global earlystage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum the purchase price for mpi research was 8297 million  in cash subject to certain postclosing adjustments the acquisition was funded by borrowings on our 23 billion credit facility 23b credit facility as well as the issuance of 5000 million of our senior notes the mpi research business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on january 11 2018  we acquired kws biotest limited kws biotest a cro specializing in in vitro  and in vivo  discovery testing services for immunooncology inflammatory and infectious diseases the acquisition enhances our discovery expertise with complementary offerings that provide our customers with additional tools in the active therapeutic research areas of oncology and immunology the purchase price for kws biotest was 203 million  in cash subject to certain postclosing adjustments in addition to the initial purchase price the transaction includes aggregate undiscounted contingent payments of up to £ 30 million  approximately 38 million  based on recent exchange rates based on future performance during the three months ended september 29 2018 the terms of these contingent payments were amended resulting in a fixed payment of £ 20 million  approximately 25 million  based on recent exchange rates due in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 the kws biotest business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on august 4 2017 we acquired brains online a leading cro providing critical data that advances novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases brains online strategically expands our existing cns capabilities and establishes us as a singlesource provider for a broad portfolio of discovery cns services the purchase price for brains online was 213 million  in cash in addition to the initial purchase price the transaction includes aggregate undiscounted contingent payments of up to € 67 million  approximately 77 million  based on recent exchange rates based on future performance and due in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 if achieved the brains online business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on february 10 2017 we completed the divestiture of our cdmo business to quotient clinical ltd based in london england for 750 million  in proceeds net of cash cash equivalents and working capital adjustments the cdmo business was acquired in april 2016 as part of the acquisition of wil research and was reported in our manufacturing reportable segment 

fiscal quarters 

our fiscal year  is typically based on 52week s  with each quarter comp osed  of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on or closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 a 53 rd week was included in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar yearend 

business trends 

the demand for our products and services increased meaningfully in fiscal year 2018 our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros like charles river and biotechnology companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market in addition small and midsize biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2018 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital our full service earlystage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions and new business opportunities in fiscal year 2018 as clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

the primary result of these trends was robust demand for our safety assessment services in fiscal year 2018 particularly from biotechnology clients as a result of this improvement our safety assessment facilities remained well utilized in fiscal year 2018 in order to accommodate increasing client demand we continued to open modest amounts of capacity at legacy sites and gained additional capacity through the acquisition of mpi research in april 2018 price also improved slightly in fiscal year 2018 as we believe industry capacity utilization continued to increase as well we believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us as our clients continue to pursue their 

 31 

goal of more efficient and effective drug research they are evaluating outsourcing new areas of their research programs such as discovery services we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past five years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process in fiscal year 2018 demand in our discovery services business also increased meaningfully driven by biotechnology clients as many of these clients either initiated or continued to work with us on integrated programs and other projects our efforts to enhance our sales strategies and become a trusted scientific partner for our clients’ earlystage programs have been successful and enabled us to attract new clients for our early discovery services including a growing base of biotechnology clients demand from large biopharmaceutical companies also increased these clients continue to have significant internal discovery capabilities on which they can choose to rely in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to increasingly outsource more work to us we must continue to demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients’ drug discovery processes demand for our in vivo  discovery services continued to increase in fiscal year 2018 and we acquired kws biotest in january 2018 to enhance our discovery expertise and provide immunooncology capabilities to our clients  

demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2018 demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions our biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market to support this increased demand we continue to expand the capacity of our biologics business 

demand for our research models and services increased in fiscal year 2018 driven by strong demand for research models in china higher revenue for research model services and improved pricing demand for research models in china continued to be robust in fiscal year 2018 as clients in this growing market continue to value our highquality research models and we expanded our geographic footprint demand for research models services also improved in fiscal year 2018 particularly for our is and gems businesses the is business further benefited from being awarded a fiveyear 957 million contract from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases or niaid which commenced in september 2018 the continued effect of the consolidation of internal infrastructure within our large biopharmaceutical clients and a longerterm trend towards more efficient use of research models has led to reduced demand for research models outside of china  we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and the rms business will continue to be an important source of cash flow generation for us 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

revenue for fiscal year 2018  was 23 billion  compared to 19 billion  in fiscal year 2017  the 2018  increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2017  was 4085 million  or 220  and was primarily due to both growth in our dsa and manufacturing segments as discussed in the above “business trends” section as well as the recent acquisitions of mpi research kws biotest and brains online the positive effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased revenue by 237 million  or 13  when compared to the corresponding period in 2017 

in fiscal year 2018  our operating income and operating income margin were 3314 million  and 146  respectively compared with 2883 million  and 155  respectively in fiscal year 2017  the increase in operating income was primarily due to our recent acquisitions and increased demand from biotechnology and global biopharmaceutical clients the decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to increased amortization expense and costs related to our recent acquisitions as well as continued investments to support future growth of the company which includes increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increase facility expansions primarily in the rms microbial solutions and biologics businesses and companywide it and infrastructure projects offsetting the decreases in operating income margin were the realization of improved volume mix and pricing across our products and services portfolio as well as the impact of recent productivity initiatives across all businesses 

net income attributable to common shareholders increased to 2264 million  in fiscal year 2018  from 1234 million  in the corresponding period of 2017  the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of 1030 million  was primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above and a lower effective tax rate driven primarily by net benefits of us tax reform partially offset by lower gains on our venture capital and life insurance policy investments higher interest expense related to higher debt balances to support our recent acquisitions and the absence of a gain recorded in other income net on the cdmo divestiture in 2017 

during fiscal year 2018  our cash flows from operations was 4411 million  compared with 3181 million  for fiscal year 2017  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations and positive changes in operating assets 

 32 

and liabilities resulting from an increase in our deferred revenue and customer contract deposits as well as improved collections of our receivables 

on march 26 2018 we amended and restated our credit facility creating a 23b credit facility the 23b credit facility provides for a 7500 million term loan and a 155 billion multicurrency revolving facility the term loan facility matures in 19 quarterly installments with the last installment due march 26 2023 the revolving facility matures on march 26 2023 and requires no scheduled payment before that date under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loan andor revolving facility by up to 10 billion in the aggregate 

on april 3 2018 we issued 5000 million of 55 senior notes senior notes due in 2026 in an unregistered offering interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning on october 1 2018 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the application of our accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer “transaction price” 

to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration is included in the transaction price if in our judgment it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available sales value add and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue 

when determining the transaction price of a contract an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance resulting in a significant financing component generally we do not extend payment terms beyond one year applying the practical expedient we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less none of our contracts contained a significant financing component during fiscal year 2018  

contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations for such arrangements the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation we determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations 

contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations generally when contract modifications create new performance obligations the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is 

 33 

recognized prospectively when contract modifications change existing performance obligations the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue on a cumulative catchup basis 

product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer we generally measure our progress using either costtocost input method or righttoinvoice output method we use the costtocost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract generally related to fixed fee service contracts under the costtocost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation the costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours allocation of overhead costs research model costs and subcontractor costs revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the righttoinvoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or timebased increments such as samples tested or labor hours incurred revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date 

accounting standard codification topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” asc 606 became effective for us on december 31 2017 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption for contracts that were modified before the effective date we reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price in accordance with the practical expedient which did not have a material effect on the cumulative impact of adopting asc 606 the reported results for fiscal year 2018 reflect the application of asc 606 guidance while the historical results for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were prepared under the guidance of asc 605 “revenue recognition” asc 605 

the cumulative effect of applying asc 606 to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of december 30 2017  was immaterial there is no material difference in the reporting of revenue during fiscal year 2018  in accordance with asc 606 when compared to asc 605 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the 

 34 

related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as us tax reform us tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to i reducing the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 ii requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries iii generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iv requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations v eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and changing how existing amt credits can be realized vi subjecting certain foreign earnings to us taxation through base erosion antiabuse tax beat and global intangible lowtaxed income gilti vii creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense viii changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and ix modifying the officer’s compensation limitation 

our accounting for the elements of us tax reform is complete we have made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense see note 11 “income taxes” for further discussion 

in march 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201805 “income taxes topic 740  amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118” this standard amends accounting standards codification 740 income taxes asc 740 to provide guidance on accounting for the tax effects of us tax reform pursuant to sab 118 which allows companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 within a oneyear measurement period from the enactment date of us tax reform this standard is effective upon issuance and we have complied with the amendments 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” the standard allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects arising from the change in the reduction of the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 we elected to early adopt this standard in fiscal year 2018 as permitted on a prospective basis resulting in a reclassification of 33 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings as a result of remeasuring our deferred tax liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan gains and losses our policy is to release material stranded tax effects on a specific identification basis 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that 

 35 

the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  we elected to perform the quantitative first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2018  2017  and 2016  impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

in fiscal 2017 we recognized 177 million of asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on the rms facility in frederick maryland in connection with our global rms restructuring initiatives 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

 36 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations a 25 basis point change in the discount rate changes the projected benefit obligation by approximately 16 million to 17 million for all our plans 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in fiscal year 2018  new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2017  releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 17 million  as of december 29 2018  in fiscal year 2017  new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2016  releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 52 million  as of december 30 2017  

on january 31 2019 we commenced the process to terminate the charles river laboratories inc pension plan  us pension plan and expect to complete the termination process over the next two  years as part of the planned termination we rebalanced assets to a target asset allocation of 100 fixed income investments the change in us pension plan investments is intended to provide for a better matching of assets to the characteristics of the liabilities we intend to take further actions to reduce the volatility of the value of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and to settle remaining liabilities this includes making such contributions to the us pension plan as may be necessary to settle all liabilities including making lump sum distributions to us pension plan participants and purchasing annuity contracts to cover vested benefits for participants who decline to elect a lump sum distribution 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and rsus to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments stockbased compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value adjusted for forfeitures when they occur over the requisite service period 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of psus is estimated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change

results of operations 

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017 

revenue and operating income 

the following tables present consolidated revenue by type and by reportable segment 





the following table presents operating income by reportable segment 



the following presents the results from operating income by each of our reportable segments 

rms 



rms revenue increased   261 million  due primarily to higher research model product revenue in china and higher revenue for research model services research model services benefited from a large government contract in the is business and strong client demand in the gems business resulting from increased research and development activity conducted across biotechnology global biopharmaceutical and academic institutional clients and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by lower research model product revenue outside of china 

rms operating income increased 219 million  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  was 263  an increase of 31  from 232  for the corresponding period in 2017  operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to lower amount of costs associated 

 38 

with the realignment of our research model production site in maryland in 2018 compared to 2017 restructuring costs recorded primarily within cost of revenue incurred during 2017 were 181 million  which primarily related to noncash asset impairments and accelerated depreciation charges restructuring costs incurred during 2018 were 20 million  which primarily related to cash payments for severance and transition costs additionally operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased due to the increased revenue discussed above partially offset by continued investments to support future growth including increased investments in personnel staffing levels and hourly wage increases and facility expansions primarily in china as well as lower operating income margins on the aforementioned large government contract 

dsa 



dsa revenue increased   3369 million  due primarily to the recent acquisitions of mpi research kws biotest and brains online which contributed 2095 million  86 million and 60 million to service revenue growth respectively additionally service revenue increased in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from both biotechnology and global biopharmaceutical clients and favorable pricing and mix of services the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased revenue 

dsa operating income increased 448 million  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  dsa operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  was 173  a decrease of 14  from 187  for the corresponding period in 2017  the increase to operating income was primarily attributable to contributions from recent acquisitions of mpi research kws biotest and brains online these increases were partially offset by increased costs to support the growth of the company which include costs due to the acquisitions including a higher service cost base an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses recorded within both cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expense and higher amortization of intangible assets as substantially all of our acquisitions in fiscal year 2018  are included within the dsa reportable segment these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2018  compared to 2017  

manufacturing 



manufacturing revenue increased   455 million  due primarily to higher demand for endotoxin products and species identification services in the microbial solutions business higher service revenue in the biologics business higher product revenue in the avian business and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by the absence of 18 million of service revenue related to the cdmo business 

manufacturing operating income increased 123 million  compared to the corresponding period in 2017  manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  was 317  a decrease of 06  from 323  for the corresponding period in 2017  the increase to operating income was due primarily to the increase in revenue this increase was partially offset by increased costs to support the growth of the company including increased investments in personnel staffing 

 39 

levels and hourly wage increase facility expansions primarily in microbial solutions and biologics and increased investments in technology to support research and development efforts primarily in microbial solutions increased costs are recorded in cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses and these higher costs decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2018  compared to 2017  

unallocated corporate 



unallocated corporate costs consist of selling general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated corporate costs of 359 million is consistent with the allocated selling general and administrative expense  increases discussed above and are primarily related to an increase in compensation benefits and other employeerelated expenses and an increase in costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisitions to support the growth of the company   costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  was 75  an increase  of 03  from 72  for the corresponding period in 2017

tax related obligations 

we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities as of december 29 2018  we had 188 million  of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 29 2018  our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by 113 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen during fiscal year 2018  the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the euro british pound canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expenses which will decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2018  our revenue would 

 46 

have increased by approximately 818 million  and our operating income would have increased by approximately 70 million  if the us dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during fiscal year 2018  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit our foreign currency exposure related to both intercompany loans and a us dollar denominated loan borrowed by a nonus euro functional currency entity under our credit facility we did not have any foreign currency contracts open related to intercompany loans as of december 29 2018

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4 to 6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 7 to 10 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the nonclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  nonanimal typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human clinical trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10 to 15 years up to 20 billion excluding time costs and exploration of between 10000 and 15000 drug molecules to produce a single food and drug administration fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in earlystage drug research in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively in addition we believe we can improve and augment drug discovery and earlystage development effectiveness by coordinating the dialog between large pharmaceutical biotechnology academic and nongovernmental organizations and venture capitalists separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely as these groups increasingly rely on and interact with one another in this field we assist them in working together by developing deeper strategic relationships with each of these constituencies 

 7 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio   we are the only large global cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage we understand our clients therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

pharmaceutical manufacturing support portfolio we also offer a portfolio of products services and solutions that supports the process development scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry we provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products in particular we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods which provide the highest testing quality enhance productivity and reduce cycle time 

deep scientific expertis e  we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities including biomarkers biologics medicinal chemistry in vitro  screening in vivo  pharmacology immunology pathology biologics process development testing microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain inhouse we continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of disease focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology respiratory bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular ophthalmology and central nervous system in the areas of functional expertise it includes synthetic and medicinal chemistry cell line development in vitro  and in vivo  assay development screening nonclinical imaging structural biology process chemistry toxicology veterinary pathology bioanalysis scale up and formulation development we also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint 

commitment to animal welfare  we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3rs” replacement reduction and refinement as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support  we maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner   w e believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo  and in vitro  services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work their preference is to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlystage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and 

 8 

experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies for example during the past year 

 for some of our partners we provide a broad suite of research models and discovery and safety assessment services and for others we provide a customized and select array of discovery and safety assessment services andor research models offering flexibility enables our clients to utilize our products and services to deliver innovative health solutions in a manner which best suits their individual needs 

there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time  three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities 

we also believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services and integrated services where we work hand in hand with our customers to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff our clients have utilized this capability which blends resources both inside and outside their walls 

 9 

we maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment as a result we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital for example in each of 2016 and 2017 we completed strategic acquisitions in 2016 we completed three acquisitions in april 2016 we acquired wil research a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide in june 2016 we acquired blue stream an analytical cro supporting the development of complex biologics and biosimilars in september 2016 we acquired agilux a cro that provides a suite of integrated discovery small and large molecule bioanalytical services drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic services and pharmacology services in august 2017 we acquired brains online bol a leading cro that provides critical data that advances novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases in january 2018 we acquired kws a leading cro specializing in in vitro  and in vivo  discovery testing services for immunooncology and inflammatory and infectious diseases 

we are also partnering with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on earlystage companies through these partnerships and close relationships we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery safety assessment and biologics testing thus we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

customers   

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

 we also maintain several sales specialists which either have specific technical expertise often degreed scientists or cover unique markets 

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and industrial chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2017  no single commercial client accounted for more than 3 of our total revenue and no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio because of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 15 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada asia pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 15 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support

we have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population we also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines such as in our manufacturing businesses 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams who work in north america europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters hosting webinars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity nonclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of earlystage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition   

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments although the largest competitors within any segment vary we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 

 industry support and animal welfare 

 11 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro  assays we also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we also maintain a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees   

as of december 30 2017  we had approximately 11800 employees including approximately 1300 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and survey results 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 968 million 5900 million and 469 million respectively as of december 30 2017  as compared to 880 million 5518 million and 395 million respectively as of december 31 2016  related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in december 30 2017  backlog may be completed in 2018 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must 

 12 

also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as the european union china and japan for the care handling and use of regulated species our animal production facilities in the us our dsa facilities in the us and canada and most of our dsa and rms sites in europe are either accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation by the aaalac international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of computerized systems to ensure data integrity new guidance related to the need for data integrity compliance programs have recently been released and may require additional efforts by crl for validation audit trail review and archiving activities to be considered 

to assure that we have proper regulatory oversight over electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines vaccine support products and provided gmp contract manufacturing of clinical and marketed products additionally several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs working with our clients to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 global compliance programs are centralized under a single group responsible for global regulatory affairs compliance including quality programs and systems to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our clients’ expectations for quality and regulatory compliance to assure these compliance 

 13 

obligations we established quality assurance units qaus in each of our regulated businesses that require independent oversight the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing that studies that supports manufacturing 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the sec and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ten of the eleven members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at httpircrivercom

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of research and development and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research 

 15 

and development budgets and consequentially our business as well furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue predominantly in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for glp or cgmp requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

regulatory monitoring authorities such as the fda medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and oecd have increased their emphasis on the management of computerized systems to ensure data integrity new guidance related to the need for data integrity compliance programs have recently been released and we may require additional efforts for validation audit trail review and archiving activities to assure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance in addition the fda’s recently applicable send standardization for exchange of nonclinical data standards which apply to our customers’ nda and as of december 18 2017 ind submissions require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews accordingly our customers expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send notwithstanding some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community  noncompliance with any of these expectations could lead to official action by a government authority damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service 

 16 

operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in canada europe and asia failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

 17 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted healthcare reform legislation the patient protection and affordable care act or the aca intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations as well as from the incoming president and his administration we are uncertain as to the ultimate effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

the current executive branch of the us government has disclosed a key initiative as being to repeal or substantially unwind the aca while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that may have a material impact on us or our clients include but are not limited to appeal or reform of the aca and modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of 

 18 

winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past fifteen years we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

on february 12 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mpi research a nonclinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide if consummated this transaction will be the largest acquisition in nearly fifteen years refer to item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for more details 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 in the event that an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 19 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate and other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 30 2017  the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet  was 11747 million  

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us our international revenue represented approximately onehalf of our total revenue in recent years we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 



 20 

 changes in eu privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations the general data protection regulation gdpr becomes effective in may 2018 and will replace the 1995 data protection directive the gdpr will impose heightened obligations on businesses that control and manage the personal data of eu citizens the penalties for noncompliance are significant including up to four percent of global revenue 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

our facilities could be damaged or disrupted by natural disasters or other catastrophic events which could adversely affect our reputation financial position results of operations and cash flows  

while we have taken precautions to mitigate production and service interruptions at our global facilities a major catastrophe such as a hurricane tornado earthquake flood wildfire or other natural disaster or other unanticipated displacement at or near any of our facilities could result in physical damage to our properties including closure resulting in a prolonged interruption of our business a disruption resulting from any one of these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products reduce our capacity to provide services eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities and ultimately result in the loss of revenue and customers any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from nonclinical to clinical studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro technologies such that employ human biospecimens stem cell technologies and genome editing 

it is our strategy to explore these in vitro  technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated for example charles river laboratories cleveland ind fka chantest corporation has a welldeveloped program to evaluate the utility of induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes advanced in vitro  models and “organonachip” technologies successful commercialization of alternatives to traditional research models may not be sufficient to fully offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and a significant amount are mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object 

 21 

to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects   

as of december 30 2017  we had 11 billion  of debt and in connection with our plan to acquire mpi research see note 17 “subsequent event” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k we announced our intention to increase our debt level by approximately 830 million by obtaining a commitment letter for a bridge loan facility  we are evaluating fixedrate debt financing alternatives which could be used to finance the acquisition and for general corporate purposes our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 7 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the drug discovery development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive 

the drug discovery nonclinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

 if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our 

 22 

competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us and international tax law 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law significant us tax law changes us tax reform which reduces the us federal statutory tax rate broadens the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits limits the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense and transitions to a territorial tax system which will allow for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us with a 100 federal dividends received deduction prospectively  in addition us tax reform requires a onetime transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings several of the new provisions enacted as part of us tax reform  require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue service irs and treasury department these or other changes in us tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows 

we have substantial operations in canada ireland and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flows and effective tax rate 

currently the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany luxembourg and the uk future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

 while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially 

 23 

adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that neither we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain sites worldwide with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the expansion of the erp system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue 

in july 2015 idexx laboratories inc and idexx distribution inc collectively idexx filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we have infringed three 3 recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents in february 2017 we entered into a settlement agreement with idexx which included a license to us of the relevant technology the withdrawal by idexx of their complaint and withdrawal by us of our inter partes review filing 

legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades while we recently entered into an employment agreement with mr foster most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 24 

 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union “brexit” may adversely affect our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government continues to negotiate the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the decision by referendum to withdraw the uk from the eu caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations the execution of brexit also may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for our products and services in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the eu and the uk these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment

recent acquisitions and divestiture 

we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market our recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below 

on february 12 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mpi research a nonclinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide acquiring mpi research will enhance our position as a leading global earlystage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum the transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2018 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions the preliminary purchase price will be approximately 800 million in cash subject to customary closing adjustments the acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through an expansion of our credit facility and cash we entered into a commitment letter pursuant to which we will be provided up to 830 million under a bridge loan facility this business is expected to be reported as part of our dsa reportable segment in the 

 30 

event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances we may be required to pay a termination fee of 48 million increasing to 56 million based on other specific circumstances 

on january 11 2018  we acquired kws biotest limited kws biotest a cro specializing in in vitro  and in vivo  discovery testing services for immunooncology inflammatory and infectious diseases the acquisition enhances our discovery expertise with complementary offerings that provide our customers with additional tools in the active therapeutic research areas of oncology and immunology the purchase price for kws biotest was 203 million  in cash subject to certain postclosing adjustments that may change the purchase price and was funded by our various borrowings in addition to the initial purchase price the transaction includes aggregate undiscounted contingent payments of up to £ 30 million  approximately 41 million  based on recent exchange rates based on future performance this business will be reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on august 4 2017 we acquired brains online a leading cro providing critical data that advances novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases brains online strategically expands our existing cns capabilities and establishes us as a singlesource provider for a broad portfolio of discovery cns services the purchase price for brains online was 213 million in cash subject to certain postclosing adjustments in addition to the initial purchase price the transaction includes potential additional payments of up to €67 million approximately 79 million based on recent exchange rates based on future performance the brains online business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment 

on february 10 2017 we completed the divestiture of our cdmo business to quotient clinical ltd based in london england for 750 million in proceeds net of cash cash equivalents and working capital adjustments the cdmo business was acquired in april 2016 as part of the acquisition of wil research and was reported in our manufacturing reportable segment following a strategic review that was finalized subsequent to december 31 2016 we determined that the cdmo business was not optimized within our portfolio at its current scale and that the capital could be better deployed in other longterm growth opportunities 

fiscal quarters 

our fiscal year  is typically based on 52week s  with each quarter comp osed  of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on or closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 a 53 rd week was included in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar yearend 

business trends 

the demand for our products and services increased in fiscal year 2017 our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros like charles river and biotechnology companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market in addition small and midsize biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2017 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital academia has also benefited from partnering activities as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities our full service earlystage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in fiscal year 2017 regarding strategic relationships where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our safety assessment services in fiscal year 2017 particularly from biotechnology clients this improvement led to increased capacity utilization in our safety assessment facilities   which remained well utilized in fiscal year 2017   price also improved slightly in fiscal year 2017 as industry capacity utilization continued to increase in order to accommodate increasing client demand we continued to open small amounts of new capacity in fiscal year 2017 we believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us as our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research they are evaluating outsourcing new areas of their research programs such as discovery services we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past four years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process in fiscal year 2017 demand in our discovery services business was stable the completion of a few large integrated early discovery projects from biopharmaceutical clients in fiscal year 2016 was largely offset with improving demand from biotechnology clients as many of these clients either initiated or continued to work with us on integrated programs and other projects large biopharmaceutical companies continue to have significant internal discovery capabilities on which they can choose to rely in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to increasingly outsource more work to us we must continue to 

 31 

demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients’ drug discovery processes the business changes that we implemented in fiscal year 2016   including a small site consolidation and realignment of sales strategies   in our early discovery business have been successful resulting in the stabilization of the business in fiscal year 2017 and in attracting new clients including a growing base of biotechnology clients demand for our   in vivo   discovery services continued to increase in fiscal year 2017 and we acquired brains online in august 2017 to enhance our position as the premier singlesource provider for a broad portfolio of discovery cns services in addition we acquired kws biotest limited in january 2018 to enhance our discovery expertise with complementary offerings that provide our customers with additional tools in the active therapeutic research areas of oncology and immunology 

demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2017 demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions our biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market to support this increased demand we continue to expand the capacity of our biologics business 

demand for our research models and services was stable in fiscal year 2017 demand for research models in mature markets outside of china declined modestly partially offset by improved pricing the continued effect of the consolidation of internal infrastructure within our large biopharmaceutical clients and a longerterm trend towards more efficient use of research models has led to reduced demand for research models demand for research models in china continued to be robust in fiscal year 2017 as clients in this growing market continue to value our highquality research models to accommodate increased demand we opened a new research models facility in china in late 2017 demand for research models services also improved in fiscal year 2017 particularly for our gems and is businesses we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts and the rms business will continue to be an important source of cash flow generation for us 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

revenue for fiscal year 2017  was 18576 million  compared to 16814 million  in fiscal year 2016  the 2017  increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2016  was 1762 million  or 105  and was primarily due to growth in our dsa and manufacturing segments as discussed in the above “business trends” section 

in fiscal year 2017  our operating income and operating income margin were 2875 million  and 155  respectively compared with 2374 million  and 141  respectively in fiscal year 2016  the increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to increased demand in our dsa and manufacturing segments the effects of our recent acquisitions and various productivity initiatives 

net income attributable to common shareholders decreased to 1234 million  in fiscal year 2017  from 1548 million  in the corresponding period of 2016  the decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of 314 million  was primarily due to an increase in the provision for income taxes of 1046 million  as a result of us tax reform partially offset by an increase in operating income as discussed above as well as a gain of 106 million on the cdmo divestiture and an increase of 126 million  in gains on our venture capital investments 

during fiscal year 2017  our cash flows from operations was 3181 million  compared with 3169 million  for fiscal year 2016  the increase was primarily driven by positive changes in operating assets and liabilities due to the recognition of a tax payable in connection with the recent us tax reform and the timing of our accounts payable and accrued compensation payments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in income from continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as part of our efficiency initiatives we committed to a plan to close our rms production facility in maryland before the end of 2018 consolidate production in other facilities and to reduce our workforce at certain other global rms facilities total costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were 181 million  of which 177 million  related to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation additional costs are expected to be incurred during 2018 resulting from accelerated lease obligations severance and transition costs and site consolidation costs in the range of 65 million to 75 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these 

 32 

estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the application of our accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been provided our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract in cases where performance spans reporting periods revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known changes in scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above 

most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project fees earned to date or in some cases a termination fee such payments are included in revenues when earned 

we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition we defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria 

a portion of our revenue is from multipleelement arrangements that include multiple products andor services as deliverables in a single arrangement with each deliverable or a combination of the deliverables representing a separate unit of accounting we allocate revenues to each element in a multipleelement arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met judgments as to the identification of deliverables units of accounting the allocation of consideration to the deliverable and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements 

at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either 1 our performance to achieve the milestone or 2 the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement we evaluate factors such as the scientific clinical regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment  if a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved if we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones in those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive we recognize as revenue on the date 

 33 

the milestone is achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance as of december 30 2017  we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive 

we record shipping charges billed to customers in total revenue and record shipping costs in c ost of revenue excluding amortization of intangible assets  for all periods presented 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as us tax reform us tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to i reducing the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 ii requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries iii generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iv requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations v eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and changing how existing amt credits can be realized vi creating the base erosion antiabuse tax beat a new minimum tax vii creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense viii changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and ix modifying the officer’s compensation limitation 

the provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2017 includes a 785 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of us tax reform the estimated impact of us tax reform consists of 735 million relating to the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated earnings 182 million of withholding and state taxes relating to withdrawal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion regarding unremitted earnings and 132 million tax benefit for the revaluation of us federal net deferred tax liabilities from 35 to 21 the final impact of us tax reform may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations analysis and assumptions made by management additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service and any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impact therefore our accounting for the elements of us tax reform is incomplete however we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of us tax reform 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we asserted that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were deemed indefinitely reinvested as they were required to fund needs outside of the us as a result of the deemed repatriation toll tax and 

 34 

other effects of us tax reform enacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we have withdrawn our indefinite reinvestment assertion for all of our unremitted foreign earnings and have provided deferred taxes of 182 million for future withholding and state income taxes upon the repatriation of these earnings in light of the reduced incremental tax cost of repatriating unremitted earnings as well as other effects of us tax reform we have determined we can no longer overcome the presumption that all undistributed foreign earnings will ultimately be transferred to the us parent entity 

in fiscal 2017 we adopted accounting standard update asu 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the standard reduces complexity in several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased compensation including certain income tax consequences excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized in the consolidated statements of income on a prospective basis the adoption to recognize excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the consolidated statements of income on a prospective basis could result in fluctuations in the effective tax rate periodoverperiod depending on how many awards vest and the volatility of our stock price during fiscal year 2017  the impact to the provision for income taxes within the consolidated statements of income was an excess tax benefit of 110 million  further for fiscal year 2017  we excluded the effect of windfall tax benefits from the hypothetical proceeds used to calculate the repurchase of shares under the treasury stock method for the calculation of diluted earnings per share 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

during fiscal year 2016 we determined that the carrying values of certain dsa intangible assets were not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of 19 million  which was included in costs of services provided excluding amortization of intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated

weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2017  2016  and 2015  impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

in the second quarter of 2016 we revised the composition of our reportable segments to align with the view of the business following our acquisition of wil research as a result goodwill was allocated from our rms reportable segment to our manufacturing reportable segment based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit in addition we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

in fiscal 2017 we recognized 177 million  of asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on the rms facility in frederick maryland in connection with our global rms restructuring initiatives 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in fiscal year 2017 new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and united kingdom uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2016 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 52 million as of 

 36 

december 30 2017 in fiscal year 2016 new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2015 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 13 million as of december 31 2016 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units rsus and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and rsus to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change 

due to our adoption in fiscal 2017 of asu 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures when they occur on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs capital expansion acquisitions pay our debt and pension obligations our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations supplemented by longterm borrowings based on our current business plan we believe that our existing funds when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

the following table presents our cash cash equivalents and investments 



borrowings 

on march 30 2016 we amended and restated our 13 billion credit facility creating our 165b credit facility which 1 extended the maturity date for the credit facility and 2 made certain other amendments in connection with our acquisition of wil research the 165b credit facility provides for up to 165 billion in financing including a 6500 million term loan facility and a 10 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility the term loan facility matures in 19 quarterly installments with the last installment due march 30 2021 the revolving credit facility matures on march 30 2021 and requires no scheduled payment before that date 

amounts outstanding under the 165b credit facility were as follows 



under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loan facility andor revolving credit facility by up to 5000 million in the aggregate the interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving loans under the 165b credit facility are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of 1 the prime rate 2 the federal funds rate plus 050 or 3 the onemonth adjusted libor rate plus 1 or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio 

in connection with our plan to acquire mpi research our intention is to increase our debt level by approximately 830 million as we obtained a commitment for a bridge loan facility  we are evaluating fixedrate debt financing alternatives which could be used to finance the acquisition and for general corporate purposes

cash flows 

the following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by cash flows from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for 1 noncash operating items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred income taxes gains on venture capital investments and divestiture and impairment charges as well as 2 changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations net cash provided by operating activities increased from fiscal year 2016  to 2017  the increase was primarily driven by positive changes in operating assets and liabilities due to the recognition of a tax payable in connection with the recent us tax reform and the timing of our accounts payable and accrued compensation payments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in income from continuing operations the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year 2015  to 2016  was primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations partially offset by a negative change in operating assets and liabilities our days sales outstanding which includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable but is not adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts in the calculation was 60  days as of december 30 2017  compared to 52  days as of december 31 2016  and 51  days as of december 26 2015  the increase was primarily driven by changes in the timing of certain working capital items related to integration of the information systems of wil research which the company acquired in 2016 and timing of deferred revenue 

the following table presents our net cash used in investing activities 



the primary use of cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017  related to our capital expenditures to support the growth of the business net investment activity and our acquisition of brains online partially offset by the proceeds from the divestiture of the cdmo business the primary use of cash in fiscal year 2016  was related to our acquisitions of wil research for 5774 million net of cash acquired agilux for 620 million net of cash acquired and blue stream for 87 million net of cash acquired as well as our capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments net of purchases of investments and contributions to venture capital investments the principal use of cash in fiscal year 2015  was related to our acquisitions of celsis for 2020 million net of cash acquired oncotest for 352 million net of cash acquired and sunrise for 96 million net of cash acquired as well as our capital expenditures

 the above table excludes obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for more details 

 46 

tax related obligations 

we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities as of december 30 2017  we had 247 million  of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 

additionally we excluded federal and state income tax liabilities of 735 million which is net of a federal benefit of state income tax from our summary of contractual obligations presented above relating to the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated earnings under us tax reform of which 129 million is expected to be paid within one year the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest

mpi research 

on february 12 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mpi research in the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances we may be required to pay a termination fee of 48 million increasing to 56 million based on other specific circumstances refer to item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for more details

letters of credit 

our offbalance sheet commitments related to our outstanding letters of credit as of december 30 2017  were 49 million  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 30 2017  our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by 110 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen during fiscal year 2017  the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expenses which will decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2017  our revenue would have increased by approximately 720 million  and our operating income would have increased by approximately 52 million  if the us dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

 47 

during fiscal year 2017  we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge certain balance sheet exposures resulting from currency fluctuations no foreign currency contracts were open as of december 30 2017

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner   w e believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and nonclinical in vivo  and in vitro  services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work their preference is to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlystage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies for example in 2016 we extended the term of our longstanding integrated drug discovery alliance with genentech a member of the roche group through this alliance we provide genentech early discovery services including medicinal chemistry  in vitro and  in vivo  biology structural biology and computeraided drug design to help identify promising candidates for nonclinical development and  in 2015 we extended the term of our collaboration with astrazeneca for outsourced regulated safety assessment and development drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics until 2020 for some of our partners we provide a broad suite of research models and discovery and safety assessment services and for others we provide a customized and select array of discovery and safety assessment services andor research models offering flexibility enables our clients to utilize our products and services to deliver innovative health solutions in a manner which best suits their individual needs 

there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and nonclinical support needs we believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research nonclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time  three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities 

we also believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range 

 9 

of services and integrated services where we work hand in hand with our customers to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff our clients have utilized this capability which blends resources both inside and outside their walls 

we maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment as a result we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital for example in each of 2015 and 2016 we completed significant strategic acquisitions in 2015 we acquired celsis group limited a leading provider of rapid bacterial detection systems for sterile and nonsterile quality control testing in the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries in 2016 we made three acquisitions in april we acquired wil research a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide in june we acquired blue stream an analytical cro supporting the development of complex biologics and biosimilars in september we acquired agilux a cro that provides a suite of integrated discovery small and large molecule bioanalytical services drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic services and pharmacology services 

our acquisition strategy also takes into account geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services for example in 2015 we acquired oncotest a germanybased cro providing discovery services for oncology which complements our existing in vivo  discovery businesses in the us and finland and sunrise a producer of spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses 

we are also partnering with a number of venture capital firms primarily investing in life sciences healthcare and technology companies with an emphasis on earlystage emerging growth companies  through these partnerships we are able to promote contract research services for discovery and safety assessment to these companies for example in 2016 we committed to invest 10 million in biomotiv llc the therapeutic accelerator company associated with the harrington project for discovery and development through this agreement we will be the preferred drug discovery and nonclinical development partner for biomotiv’s portfolio of technologies and companies this offers us the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

customers   

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

 we also maintain several sales specialists which either have specific technical expertise often degreed scientists or cover unique markets 

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2016  no single commercial client accounted for more than 3 of our total revenue and no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our early 

 10 

stage portfolio b ecause of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 15 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 15 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population we also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines such as in our manufacturing business 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams who work in north america europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters hosting webinars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity nonclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of earlystage drug research   are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition   

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments although the largest competitors within any segment vary we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 



 11 

 industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro  assays we also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we also maintain a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees   

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 11000 employees including approximately 1200 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and survey results 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 880 million 5518 million and 395 million respectively as of december 31 2016  as compared to 1066 million 3278 million and 362 million respectively as of december 26 2015  related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in december 31 2016  backlog may be completed in 2017 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

 12 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act  awa  governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service  phs  must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture  usda  and similar agencies in other countries such as the european union china japan and canada for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities in the us our dsa facilities in the us and canada and most of our dsa and rms sites in the europe are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice  glp  glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines vaccine support products and provided gmp contract manufacturing of clinical and marketed products additionally several of our laboratories conduct analytical testing such as identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs working with our clients to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice  cgmp  regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 global compliance programs are centralized under a single group responsible for global quality programs and systems to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our clients’ expectations for 

 13 

quality and regulatory compliance to assure these compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qaus in each of our regulated businesses that require independent oversight the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or analytical testing that studies that supports manufacturing 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the sec and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 eight of the nine members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwircrivercom

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in nonclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of nonclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development   decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the nonclinical phases of research and development and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations   similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government 

 15 

funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the department of state the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other oversight agencies in canada europe and asia failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted healthcare reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations as well as from the incoming president and his administration we are uncertain as to the ultimate effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

in addition the recent presidential and congressional elections in the us may result in significant changes in and uncertainty with respect to legislation regulation and government policy while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes at the local state or federal level may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses andor those of our clients specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that may have a material impact on us or our clients include but are not limited to appeal or reform of the health care reform act and modifications to international trade policy public company reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for glp or cgmp requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to be updated notably the european directive 201063eu requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017   some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the nonclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past fifteen years we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

in april 2016  we acquired wil research a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide this transaction was our largest acquisition in over ten years 

acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 in the event that an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

 19 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate and other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 31 2016  the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet  was 11820 million  

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us our international revenue represented approximately onehalf of our total revenue in recent years   we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

 these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign 

 20 

government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from nonclinical to clinical studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro  technologies such that employ human materials stem cell technology and other model creation technology however the increasing availability and utility of these in vitro  models is partially offset by these technologies facilitating the creation of humanized highly specialized and specific diseasemimicking models we can produce 

it is our strategy to explore these in vitro  technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated for example chantest corporation has a welldeveloped program to evaluate the cardiac properties of induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes we may not be successful in commercializing these methods and furthermore revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects   

 as of december 31 2016  we had 12 billion  of debt our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 7 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the drug discovery development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive 

the drug discovery nonclinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 



 21 

 if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us and international tax law 

in the us there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits implementing a territorial regime of taxation limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense modifying the foreign tax credit rules and reducing the ability to defer us tax on offshore earnings these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and effective tax rate 

currently the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting  beps  this initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany and the uk future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 



 22 

 while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that neither we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain sites worldwide with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning  erp  system the expansion of the erp system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue 

in july 2015 idexx laboratories inc and idexx distribution inc collectively idexx filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we have infringed three 3 recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents we filed our answer to the complaint on july 21 2016 in addition on july 29 2016 we initiated an inter partes  review ipr procedure with the united states patent and trademark office challenging the validity of the idexx patents on february 6 2017 we entered into a settlement agreement with idexx which involved the withdrawal by idexx of their complaint and withdrawal by us of the ipr 

legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

 23 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union “brexit” may adversely affect our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the decision by referendum to withdraw the uk from the eu has caused significant 

 24 

volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations including the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies the execution of brexit also may create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for our products and services in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the eu and the uk these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation which can be costly  

our industry has a history of intellectual property litigation on july 31 2015 idexx laboratories inc and idexx distribution inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we infringed three recently issued patents related to a dried blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents legal proceedings relating to intellectual property can be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns regardless of the outcome of the litigation on february 6 2017 we entered into a settlement agreement with idexx which involved the withdrawal by idexx of their complaint and withdrawal by us of the ipr 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments to be reported in response to item 1b 




 item 2 properties 

we own or lease the land and buildings where we have facilities we own large facilities facilities over 50000 square feet for our dsa businesses in canada france ireland netherlands scotland and the us and lease large facilities in england and the us we own large rms facilities in canada china france germany italy japan england and the us we own large manufacturing segment facilities in the us and china none of our leases is individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew  and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us   we believe that our facilities in each of our reportable segments are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available when needed for additional information see note 7 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies”  included in  item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

capacity at our safety assessment businesses within our dsa segment is primarily based on physical room infrastructure designed towards meeting specific scientific and regulatory requirements we track room utilization on an ongoing basis and depending on the needs of our clients at given times we may need to execute on contingent plans for expansion which average between six and fifteen months to complete 

we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not party to any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition 

in may 2013 with the assistance of the law firm of davis polk  wardwell llp we commenced an investigation into inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts this issue had been reported to our senior management by a charles river employee we promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers the department of health and human services’ office of the inspector general and the department of justice and we are cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter the investigation confirmed that our rms business 

 25 

segment billed the department of health and human services for certain work that had not been performed with respect to a small subset of our government contracts it has been determined that when employees regularly assigned to work in research model barrier rooms associated with these contracts were absent other employees names would be substituted on timekeeping records associated with the relevant contracts we billed the government for the hours associated with these substitute employees despite the fact that in many cases these employees did not perform any services in connection with the relevant government contracts based on the findings of the investigation to date we believe that this conduct was limited to our research model facilities in raleigh north carolina and kingston new york we previously identified approximately 15 million of excess amounts billed on these contracts and recorded a liability for such amount based on our ongoing discussions with the government we have recorded an additional charge of 03 million during the fiscal year 2016 our best estimate which totals 18 million may be subject to change based on the terms of any final settlement with the department of justice and the department of health and human services’ office of the inspector general we have already taken appropriate steps to prevent this conduct from recurring and will consider additional remedial measures following the conclusion of the matter 

in july 2015 idexx filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we have infringed three 3 recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents on september 21 2015 we timely filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter and therefore are invalid on october 7 2015 idexx filed an amended complaint which substantially asserted the same patents and infringement allegations as asserted in the original complaint and on october 26 2015 we timely filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint the hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on january 12 2016 on july 1 2016 the court issued an opinion denying the motion to dismiss we filed our answer to the complaint on july 21 2016 in addition on july 29 2016 we initiated an inter partes  review ipr procedure with the united states patent and trademark office challenging the validity of the idexx patents on february 6 2017 we entered into a settlement agreement with idexx which involved the withdrawal by idexx of their complaint and withdrawal by us of the ipr

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentage changes from period over period may not recalculate due to rounding 

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro for 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp which are able to support our clients from target identification through nonclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

our client base includes all of the major global biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies cros agricultural and industrial chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies and diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies around the world we currently operate approximately 75 facilities in 23 countries worldwide which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions is sites 

business trends 

the demand for our products and services increased in fiscal year 2016 our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have refocused on their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts after a period of greater emphasis on latestage programs to bring new drugs to market in addition small and midsize biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2016 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital academia has also benefited from partnering activities as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities our full service earlystage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in fiscal year 2016 regarding strategic relationships where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our safety assessment services in fiscal year 2016 particularly from biotechnology clients this improvement led to increased capacity utilization in our safety assessment facilities with utilization approaching optimal levels price also improved moderately in fiscal year 2016 as industry capacity utilization continued to increase in view of client demand we expanded our global footprint and reinforced our scientific leadership in safety assessment services by acquiring wrh inc wil research in april 2016 we also opened small amounts of new capacity in fiscal year 2016 including the reopening of our charles river massachusetts facility we believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us 

demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2016 demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions our biologics testing solutions biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market to enhance our ability to support biologic and biosimilar development we acquired blue stream laboratories inc blue stream in june 2016 

as our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research they are evaluating outsourcing new areas of their research programs such as discovery services we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past three years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process in fiscal year 2016 demand from biotechnology clients was strong for discovery services but demand from larger biopharmaceutical clients fluctuated particularly for our early discovery capabilities we believe this is due to the fact that large biopharmaceutical companies have significant internal discovery capabilities on which they can choose to rely in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to 

 30 

increasingly outsource more work to us we must continue to demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients’ drug discovery process we implemented business changes   including a small site consolidation and realignment of sales strategies   in fiscal year 2016 in our early discovery business to expedite this process demand for our   in vivo   discovery services continued to increase in fiscal year 2016 and we acquired agilux laboratories inc agilux in september 2016 to strengthen our bioanalytical services offering and reinforce the linkage between our discovery and safety assessment capabilities 

demand for research models and services improved modestly in fiscal year 2016 we remain confident in the longterm drivers of this business because research models and services remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts 

acquisitions 

we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market fiscal year 2016  acquisitions included 

 segment reporting 

we report our performance in three reportable segments research models and services rms discovery and safety assessment dsa and manufacturing support manufacturing we aggregate our operating segments into a reportable segment if a they have similar economic characteristics b they are similar in the in the nature of the products or services nature of the production process type or class of customer for their products and services methods used to distribute their products and services and nature of the regulatory environment and c the aggregation helps users better understand our performance 

in the second quarter of 2016  we acquired wil research wil research’s safety assessment business is reported in our dsa reportable segment and its cdmo business created a new operating segment contract manufacturing that is reported as part of our manufacturing reportable segment on february 10 2017  we divested the cdmo business in addition amounts due to changes in our market strategy for certain services and resulting information provided to the chief operating decision maker were reclassified from our rms reportable segment to our manufacturing reportable segment including revenue of 28 million  and 37 million  for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  respectively and operating income of 05 million  and 06 million  for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 31 

the revised reportable segments are as follows 

our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models as well as the supply of large research models research model services includes three business units genetically engineered models and services gems which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models research animal diagnostic services rads which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models and is which provides management of our clients’ research operations including recruitment training staffing and management services our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services which are nonregulated services to assist clients with the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for drug development and regulated and nonregulated safety assessment services our manufacturing segment includes microbial solutions which includes   in vitro  nonanimal lotrelease testing products and microbial detection conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and nonsterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products and species identification services biologics which performs specialized testing of biologics avian vaccine services avian which supplies specificpathogenfree fertile chicken eggs and chickens and contract manufacturing which until we divested this business on february 10 2017  specialized in formulation design and development manufacturing and analytical and stability testing for small molecules 

fiscal quarters 

our fiscal year  is typically based on 52week s  with each quarter comp osed  of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on or closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 a 53 rd week was included in fiscal year 2016 which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar yearend the additional week was included in the fourth quarter 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that our application of the following accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data”  in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been provided our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract in cases where 

 32 

performance spans reporting periods revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known changes in scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above 

most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project fees earned to date or in some cases a termination fee such payments are included in revenues when earned 

we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria 

a portion of our revenue is from multipleelement arrangements that include multiple products andor services as deliverables in a single arrangement with each deliverable or a combination of the deliverables representing a separate unit of accounting we allocate revenues to each element in a multipleelement arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met judgments as to the identification of deliverables units of accounting the allocation of consideration to the deliverable and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements 

at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either 1 our performance to achieve the milestone or 2 the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement we evaluate factors such as the scientific clinical regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment  if a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved if we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones in those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive we recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance as of december 31 2016  we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited 

 33 

to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

as of december 31 2016  our nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings were 7046 million as of the end of fiscal year 2016  our policy with respect to the undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries is to maintain an indefinite reinvestment assertion as they are required to fund needs outside of the us and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially taxfree this assertion is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the us and our foreign subsidiaries if we decide to repatriate funds to the us in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs the resulting tax consequences could negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings on december 18 2015 the us enacted the consolidated appropriations act which reinstated and extended the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough rules through the fiscal year 2019 this rule allows us to access chinese and canadian cash in a more taxefficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the us without triggering residual us tax as such we are accruing foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change for the years in which the rules are reinstated 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

during fiscal year 2016 we determined that the carrying values of certain dsa intangible assets were not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of 19 million  which was included in costs of services provided excluding amortization of intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step 

 34 

of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2016  2015  and 2014  impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 

in the second quarter of 2016  we revised the composition of our reportable segments to align with the view of the business following our acquisition of wil research see note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies as a result goodwill was allocated from our rms reportable segment to our manufacturing reportable segment based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit in addition we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

 35 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in fiscal year 2016 new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2015 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 13 million as of december 31 2016 in fiscal year 2015 new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and the united kingdom uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 33 million as of december 26 2015 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and performance share units psus to employees and stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change 

we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing sharebased compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ or are expected to materially differ from our estimates

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs pension obligations capital expansion acquisitions and to pay our debt obligations our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations supplemented by longterm borrowings based on our current business plan we believe that our existing funds when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

the following table presents our cash cash equivalents and investments 



borrowings 

in april 2015 we amended and restated our 970m credit facility creating a 13 billion facility 13b credit facility that provides for a 4000 million term loan facility and a 9000 million multicurrency revolving facility the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the company’s 13b credit facility were at our option equal to either the alternate base rate which is the higher of 1 the prime rate 2 the federal funds rate plus 05 or 3 the onemonth adjusted libor rate plus 1 or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio 

on march 30 2016 we amended and restated our 13b credit facility creating a 165 billion credit facility 165b credit facility which 1 extends the maturity date for the credit facility and 2 makes certain other amendments in connection with our acquisition of wil research the 165b credit facility provides for up to approximately 165 billion in financing including a 6500 million term loan facility and a 10 billion multicurrency revolving facility the term loan facility matures in 19 quarterly installments with the last installment due march 30 2021 the revolving facility matures on march 30 2021 and requires no scheduled payment before that date under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loans andor revolving line of credit by up to 5000 million in the aggregate

cash flows 

the following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for 1 noncash operating items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation gains on venture capital investments and gains on bargain purchases as well as 2 changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations the increase in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year 2015  to 2016  was primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations and an increase in noncash adjustments primarily an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as stockbased compensation partially offset by a negative change in operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year 2014  and 2015  was primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations and a positive change in operating assets and liabilities our days sales outstanding which includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation was 52 days as of december 31 2016  compared to 51 days as of december 26 2015  and 52 days as of december 27 2014

contractual commitments and obligations 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  are as follows 

 the above table excludes obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for more details 

tax related obligations 

we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities as of december 31 2016  we had 242 million  of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk promulgated under the exchange act except as disclosed below 

venture capital investments 

we invest in several venture capital funds that invest in startup companies primarily in the life sciences industry our total commitment to these entities as of december 31 2016  was 848 million  of which we had funded 382 million  refer to note 4 “venture capital investments and marketable securities” to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data”  in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

letters of credit 

our offbalance sheet commitments related to our outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2016  were 49 million  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

 46 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 31 2016  our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by approximately 121 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound and canadian dollar during fiscal year 2016  the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment that the company recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss were the euro british pound canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies particularly as a result of brexit and other recent developments the value of our nonus revenue expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expense which will also decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue and expenses assets liabilities and cash flows will generally increase when reported in us dollars for fiscal year 2016  our revenue would have decreased by approximately 659 million  and our operating income would have decreased by approximately 28 million  respectively if the us dollar exchange rate would have strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during fiscal year 2016  we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge certain balance sheet exposures resulting from currency fluctuations

overview   

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice  glp  and nonglp which is able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities   utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

discovery  represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  nonanimal typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 1015 years up to 20 billion and exploration of between 5000 and 10000 drug molecules to produce a single food and drug administration fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in earlystage drug research   in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster our clients reduce their costs increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in earlystage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services 

for nearly 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services which now encompasses the broader earlystage drug research process our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies government agencies and hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate 64 facilities in 18 countries worldwide   which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions is sites our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our clients to overcome many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2015 our total revenue was 14 billion  and our operating income from continuing operations before income taxes was 1954 million 

we have three reporting segments research models and services  rms  discovery and safety assessment  dsa  and manufacturing support  manufacturing  

through our rms segment we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with over 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including barrier rooms andor isolator facilities in 2015 rms accounted for 347  of our total revenue and approximately 3100 of our employees including approximately 75 science professionals with advanced degrees 

our dsa business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their innovative drug discovery research their critical regulatoryrequired safety assessment testing and related drug discovery and development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies that exceeded their internal capacity and by the needs of biotechnology companies and nonprofits who traditionally outsourced most of their discovery and development programs global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their discovery and development activities because outsourcing reduces the significant investment in personnel facilities and other capital resources necessary to efficiently and effectively conduct required scientific studies 

we are one of the two largest providers of drug discovery and preclinical development services worldwide and offer a comprehensive portfolio of target discovery through safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission we have extensive expertise in the discovery of small molecule clinical candidates and in the design execution and reporting of safety 

 2 

assessment studies for both small and large molecules we currently provide discovery and safety assessment services at multiple facilities located in the united states us canada and europe our dsa segment represented 449  of our total revenue in 2015 and employed approximately 3900 of our employees including approximately 630 science professionals with advanced degrees 

through our manufacturing segment we help ensure the safe production and release of products manufactured by our clients our microbial solutions formerly known as endotoxin and microbial detection or emd business provides in vitro  methods for conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and nonsterile biopharmaceuticals and consumer products our avian vaccine services business provides specificpathogenfree  spf  fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses our biologics testing solutions business provides specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 

in 2015 manufacturing accounted for 204  of our total revenue from continuing operations and approximately 1200 of our employees including approximately 65 science professionals with advanced degrees 

in recent years we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service “onestop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts it is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is at least 50 outsourced while emerging growth areas such as in vivo  discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced 

research models and services rms  our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models and 2 research model services 

research models  our research models business is comprised   of the production and sale of research models 

research models a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies and many government agencies hospitals and academic institutions   we have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in eight countries in close proximity to our clients our research models include standard stocks and strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the fda  and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our research models include 

 certain of our research models are proprietary diseasespecific rodent models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease 

we are also a premier provider of high quality purpose bred spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

research model services  rms also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients use of research models in basic research and screening preclinical drug candidates these services address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities our services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models and managing research operations for government entities academic

safety assessment  we offer a full range of discovery and safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism  in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with biologics the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis in support of preclinical studies we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted  adme  toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects these studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate that the compound does not have the potential to prolong the cardiac qt interval we have the assays and can perform the screening for this demonstration that is required for an investigational new drug submission 

toxicology  toxicology is one of our nonclinical competencies and a competitive strength we have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of both chemicallyderived small molecule and biotechnologyderived large molecule pharmaceuticals once a lead molecule is selected toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans and new drug registrations these toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the molecule to determine if administration of the molecules to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects these studies are typically performed in research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and nonclinical development products services and solutions to support our clients discovery and earlystage drug research process development scale up and manufacturing efforts and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively in addition we believe we can improve and augment drug discovery and earlystage development effectiveness by coordinating the dialog between large pharmaceutical biotechnology academic and nongovernmental organizations and venture capitalists separately through our various manufacturing segment businesses we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely as these groups increasingly rely and interact with one another in this field we assist them in working together by developing deeper strategic relationships with each of these constituencies 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio   we are the only large global cro  with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage we understand our clients therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

pharmaceutical manufacturing support portfolio we also offer a portfolio of products services and solutions that supports the process development scale up and quality control efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry we provide products and services that support the development and release of commercialized biologics products in particular we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods which provide the highest testing quality enhance productivity and reduce cycle time

 7 

preclinical imaging structural biology process chemistry toxicology veterinary pathology bioanalysis scale up and formulation development we also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics manufacturing portfolio in areas of greatest industry need where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early development portfolio and global footprint 

commitment to animal welfare  we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the “3rs” replacement reduction and refinement as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support  we maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions  each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client by utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities we help clients create a flexible infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner   w e believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and preclinical in vivo  and in vitro  services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work their preference is to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients support across the earlierstage drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery development and manufacturing processes over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies for example in 2015 we extended the term of our collaboration with astrazeneca for outsourced regulated safety assessment and development drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics until 2020 for some of these partners we provide a broad suite of our research models and discovery and safety assessment services and for others we provide a customized and select array of discovery and safety assessment services andor research models offering flexibility enables our clients to utilize our products and services to deliver innovative health solutions in a manner which best suits their individual needs 

there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

there have been fundamental shifts in the manufacturing needs of our clients clients have significantly outsourced their small molecule manufacturing capacity by selling off assets as well as contracting with contract manufacturing organizations  cmos  there is now a very large global and highly fragmented cmo industry supporting the industry biologic production has been slower to be outsourced but this is accelerating furthermore the industry is increasing reliance on venture capital funded and midtier companies for new small molecule and biologics drugs and they prefer an outsourced cmo model this will continue to drive further manufacturing outsourcing higher standards for quality control testing during process 

 8 

development and ongoing manufacturing will drive enhanced need for cmo testing support services particularly rapid methods and fast turnaround services to minimize the impact on manufacturing timelines and costs 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros and cmos as a means of meeting their discovery and preclinical support needs we believe that the successful launch of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research preclinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness 

we believe it is critical to participate in the strategic partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time  three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities 

we also believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies which have limited or no infrastructure these clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services and integrated services where we work hand in hand with our customers to design plan and manage integrated projects and programs this includes classically outsourced services “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and staff our clients have utilized this capability which blends both resources inside and outside their walls 

we maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment as a result we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital for example in each of 2014 and 2015 we completed significant strategic acquisitions in 2014 we acquired argenta and biofocus global leaders in integrated drug discovery services with a predominant focus on in vitro  capabilities and chantest a premier provider of ion channel testing in 2015 we acquired celsis group limited a leading provider of rapid bacterial detection systems for sterile and nonsterile quality control testing in the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries 

our acquisition strategy also takes into account geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services for example in 2015 we acquired oncotest a germanybased cro providing discovery services for oncology which complements our existing in vivo  discovery businesses in the us and finland and sunrise farms a producer of spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses in 2013 we acquired microbial solutions singapore and 75 ownership of vital river the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in china and in 2014 and 2012 we acquired vivopath and accugenix respectively 

we are also partnering with a number of venture capital firms primarily investing in life sciences health care and technology companies with an emphasis on earlystage emerging growth companies through these partnerships we are able to promote contract research services for discovery and safety assessment to these companies this offers us the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

customers   

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

  9 

 we also maintain several sales specialists which either have specific technical expertise often degreed scientists or cover unique markets 

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major biopharmaceutical companies many biotechnology agricultural and chemical life science veterinary medicine medical device diagnostic and consumer product companies contract research and contract manufacturing organizations and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2015 no single commercial client accounted for more than 5 of our total revenue and no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the revenue of any of our three business segments 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midmarket clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships the structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio and in total the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent over 30 of our total revenues b ecause of the strength of these relationships we have better insight into our clients planning processes and therefore better visibility than in the past for information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 14 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 14 “segment and geographic information” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population we also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines such as in our manufacturing business 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams who work in north america europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters webinars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of earlystage drug research   are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition   

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing 

 10 

innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

we encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments although the largest competitors within any segment vary we also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients 

 industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro  assays we also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate we have recently instituted a quarterly award recognizing our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3rs at our sites globally 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees   

as of december 26 2015 we had approximately 8600 employees including approximately 770 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the us employees at some of our european facilities are represented by works councils andor unions which is consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and survey results 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 1066 million 3278 million and 362 million respectively as of december 26 2015 as compared to 1157 million 3105 million and 275 million respectively as of 

 11 

december 27 2014 related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in 2015 backlog may be completed in 2016 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act  awa  governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the us other than laboratory rats mice and chickens as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service  phs  must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture  usda  and similar agencies in other countries such as the european union china japan and canada for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities in the us  our dsa facilities in the us and canada  and most of our dsa sites in the european union are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice  glp  glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the uk health products regulatory authority in ireland health canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs working with our clients to fulfill their validation requirements as applicable these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice  cgmp  regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

 12 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 global compliance programs are centralized under a single group responsible for global quality programs and systems to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our clients’ expectations for quality and regulatory compliance to assure these compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qaus in each of our regulated businesses that require independent oversight the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies manufacturing or studies that support manufacturing 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our microbial solutions testing business we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the sec and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 eight of the nine members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the “investor relationscorporate governance” caption

the outsourcing trend in preclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development   decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phases of research and development and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 

our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets   similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of revenue in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities only since 2013 has funding for the nih begun to increase a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or 

 14 

unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih the drug enforcement agency as well as numerous other canadian european and asian oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

the fda is in the process of reviewing and modernizing the glp regulations to reflect current industry standards as this may change some of the glp requirements the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued 

we are at risk that changes in us government practices may negatively affect our business since it is a significant customer of ours for example in 2014 the national cancer institute nci canceled a 10year 1120 million contract that was originally initiated in 2006 which had two years remaining under the contract we produced nci research models for academic and government researchers in an effort to mitigate the effect of the cancellation we launched an outreach program to inform researchers that they could continue to obtain the nci models from us with no change in initial pricing or logistics from a revenue standpoint we received between 100 and 110 million annually to produce the models and expect that we will retain approximately half of that amount from direct sales to researchers 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

 15 

if they occur contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for glp or cgmp requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably the european directive 201063eu requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017   some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

  16 

 if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate and other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles to the extent goodwill or other intangibles are impaired their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 26 2015 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet  was 7196 million  

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf of our total revenue in recent years   we expect that 

 17 

international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

 these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and viceversa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro  technologies such as human materials stem cell technology and model creation technology however the increasing availability and utility of these in vitro  models is partially offset by these technologies facilitating the creation of humanized highly specialized and specific disease mimicking models we can produce 

it is our strategy to explore these in vitro  technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated for example chantest has a welldeveloped program to evaluate the cardiac properties of induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes we may not be successful in commercializing these methods and furthermore revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits 

 18 

from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders periodic demonstrations at our operating sites occur particularly where large animals are situated any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers such as our airline carriers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects   

at december 26 2015 we had 8294 million of debt and in connection with our plan to acquire wil research see note 16 “subsequent events” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k we announced our intention to increase our borrowing by approximately 3500 million our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 7 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

the drug discovery development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive 

the drug discovery preclinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros and cmos but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

  19 

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros and cmos generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us and international tax law 

in the us there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits implementing a territorial regime of taxation limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and reducing the ability to defer us tax on offshore earnings these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and effective tax rate 

currently the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting  beps  this initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany and the united kingdom future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

 while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

 20 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past fifteen years we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

on january 6 2016 we announced our plans to acquire wil research a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide if consummated this transaction will be the largest acquisition in over ten years refer to item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for more details 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 in the event that an acquired business technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

  21 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain sites worldwide with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning  erp  system the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from thirdparties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends in part on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for four decades we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

  22 

 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation which can be costly  

our industry has a history of intellectual property litigation on july 31 2015 idexx laboratories inc and idexx distribution inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we infringed three recently issued patents related to a dried blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents legal proceedings relating to intellectual property can be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns regardless of the outcome of the litigation while we intend to defend against this proceeding vigorously if we do not prevail in this lawsuit we might be ordered to pay damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use the technology on unfavorable terms 

since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition capital requirements legal requirements earnings and other factors consequently our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments to be reported in response to item 1b 




 item 2 properties 

we own or lease the land and buildings where we have facilities we own large facilities facilities over 50000 square feet for our dsa businesses in canada ireland scotland and the united states and lease large facilities in england and the united states we own large rms facilities in canada china france germany japan england and the united states we own large manufacturing segment facilities in the united states and china none of our leases is individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew  and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us   we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available when needed for additional information see note 7 “longterm debt and capital lease obligations” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies”  included in  item 8 “financial statements and other supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

capacity at our safety assessment businesses within our dsa segment is primarily based on physical room infrastructure designed towards meeting specific scientific and regulatory requirements we track room utilization on an ongoing basis and 

 23 

depending on the needs of our clients at given times we may need to execute on contingent plans for expansion which average between six and fifteen months to complete 

we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not party to any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition 

in early may 2013 with the assistance of the law firm of davis polk  wardwell llp we commenced an investigation of inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts this issue had been reported to our senior management by a charles river employee we promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers the department of health and human services office of the inspector general and the department of justice and is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter 

the investigation to date has confirmed that our rms business segment billed the department of health and human services for certain work that had not been performed with respect to a small subset of our government contracts it has been determined that when employees regularly assigned to work in research model barrier rooms associated with these contracts were absent other employees names would be substituted on timekeeping records associated with the relevant contracts we billed the government for the hours associated with these substitute employees despite the fact that in many cases these employees did not perform any services in connection with the relevant government contracts based on the findings of the investigation to date we believe that this conduct was limited to our research model facilities in raleigh north carolina and kingston new york we have identified approximately 15 million in excess amounts billed on these contracts since january 1 2007 and have recorded a liability for such amount as of december 26 2015 because of the ongoing discussions with the government and the complex nature of this matter we believe it is reasonably possible that additional losses may be incurred but cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such estimated liability 

we have already taken appropriate steps to prevent this conduct from recurring and will consider additional remedial measures following the conclusion of the investigation 

on july 31 2015 idexx laboratories inc and idexx distribution inc collectively idexx  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging we infringed three recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents on september 21 2015 we timely filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter and therefore are invalid on october 7 2015 idexx filed an amended complaint which substantially asserts the same patents and infringement allegations as asserted in the original complaint and on october 26 2015 we timely filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint while no prediction may be made as to the outcome of litigation we intend to defend against this proceeding vigorously and therefore an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentage changes from period over period may not recalculate due to rounding 

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro for nearly 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp which are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

our client base includes all of the major global pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies cros agricultural and industrial chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies and diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies around the world we currently operate approximately 64 facilities in 18 countries worldwide which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions is sites 

business trends 

the demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2015 as did demand for products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have refocused on their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts after a period of greater emphasis on delivering latestage programs to bring new drugs to market in addition small and midsize biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2015 from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment by venture capital academia has also benefited from partnering activities as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities 

the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2015 particularly from biotechnology clients this improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment facilities which were open during 2015 and in which utilization approached optimal levels price also improved moderately in the fiscal year 2015 as industry capacity utilization continued to increase we believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us in order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients’ needs we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2015 at existing facilities and reopened our charles river massachusetts facility in the first quarter of 2016 charles river massachusetts will provide additional capacity for earlystage drug research services and is strategically located near the bostoncambridge biotechnology hub 

demand for our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities was also robust in the fiscal year 2015 our biologics testing solutions biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market demand for our microbial solutions formerly endotoxin and microbial detection or emd business also remained strong as we addressed manufacturers’ requirements for a comprehensive rapid microbial testing solution to further enhance our rapid testing portfolio we acquired celsis in the fiscal year 2015 to expand in the nonsterile quality control testing market 

our clients’ intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs to address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum we have significantly enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past two years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process we acquired 

 30 

the discovery services businesses of argenta biofocus chantest and vivopath in the fiscal year 2014 and oncotest in the fiscal year 2015 our full service earlystage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in the fiscal year 2015 regarding strategic relationships where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

demand for research models and certain services began to stabilize in the fiscal year 2015 particularly in north america and europe clients’ efforts to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity have begun to moderate as these initiatives generate the desired benefits we remain confident in the longterm drivers of this business because research models and services remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and earlystage development efforts 

acquisitions 

during the fiscal year 2015 we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market the 2015 acquisitions include 

 on january 6 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wrh inc wil research a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide acquiring wil research will enhance our position as a leading global earlystage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with global clients across the drug discovery and development continuum the transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2016 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions the preliminary purchase price will be approximately 5850 million in cash subject to customary closing adjustments the acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through an expansion of our credit facility and cash in the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances we may be required to pay wil research a termination fee of 175 million 

segment reporting 

in the second quarter of 2014 following our acquisition of argenta and biofocus we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business we reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business the recently revised gotomarket strategy longterm operating margins and the discrete financial information available to our chief operating decision maker and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors based on this review we identified three reportable segments research models and services rms discovery and safety assessment dsa and manufacturing support manufacturing we reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 31 

the revised reportable segments are as follows 

our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models as well as the supply of large research models research model services includes three business units gems which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models rads which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models and is which provides management of our clients’ research operations including recruitment training staffing and management services our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services which are nonregulated services to assist clients with the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for drug development and regulated and nonregulated safety assessment services our manufacturing segment includes microbial solutions which includes   in vitro  nonanimal lotrelease testing products and microbial detection conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and nonsterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products and species identification services biologics which performs specialized testing of biologics and avian which supplies specificpathogenfree fertile chicken eggs and chickens 

prior to recasting the reportable segments the businesses were reported in two segments as follows 

fiscal quarters 

our fiscal quarters consists of the 3 months ending on the last saturday on or prior to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that our application of the following accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 32 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been provided our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract in cases where performance spans reporting periods revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known changes in scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above 

most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project fees earned to date or in some cases a termination fee such payments are included in revenues when earned 

we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria 

a portion of our revenue is from multipleelement arrangements that include multiple products andor services as deliverables in a single arrangement with each deliverable or a combination of the deliverables representing a separate unit of accounting we allocate revenues to each element in a multipleelement arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met judgments as to the identification of deliverables units of accounting the allocation of consideration to the deliverable and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements 

at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either 1 our performance to achieve the milestone or 2 the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement we evaluate factors such as the scientific clinical regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment  if a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved if we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones in those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive we recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance as of december 26 2015 we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred 

 33 

tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

as of december 26 2015 our nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings were 5476 million as of the end of fiscal year 2015 our policy with respect to the undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries is to maintain an indefinite reinvestment assertion as they are required to fund needs outside of the us and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially taxfree this assertion is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the us and within our foreign subsidiaries if we decide to repatriate funds to the us in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs the resulting tax consequences could negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings on december 18 2015 the us enacted the consolidated appropriations act which provides for a reinstatement and extension of the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough rules through the fiscal year 2019 this rule allows us to access chinese and canadian cash in a more taxefficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the us without triggering residual us tax as such we will begin accruing foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change for the years in which the rules are reinstated 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 

 34 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2015 2014 and 2013 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired 

in 2014 we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the argenta and biofocus acquisition as a result of this reorganization goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit in addition we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets during the fiscal year 2015 we did not record any significant impairment charges to longlived assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our 

 35 

data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations beginning in the fiscal year 2014 we have employed the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary bondlink tool prior to the fiscal year 2014 we employed a cashflow matching methodology which used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index the refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model we believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner this refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of december 27 2014 by 55 million 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in the fiscal year 2014 for our uk and us plans we adopted newly released mortality tables and mortality improvement scales for measurement of retirement plan obligations which increased our benefit obligations by 79 million as of december 27 2014 in the fiscal year 2015 new mortality improvement scales were issued in the us and the uk reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that we adopted which decreased our benefit obligations by 33 million as of december 26 2015 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and performance share units psus to employees and stock options and restricted stock to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change 

we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing sharebased compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ or are expected to materially differ from our estimates

liquidity and capital resources 

we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs pension obligations capital expansion acquisitions and to pay our debt obligations our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations supplemented by longterm borrowings based on our current business plan we believe that our existing funds when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

the following table presents our cash cash equivalents and investments held by us and nonus entities 



borrowings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 26 2015  our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by approximately 84 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency the principal functional currencies of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are the euro british pound and c anadian dollar during the fiscal year 2015 the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment the company recorded as part of comprehensive income were the euro and canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the british pound 

fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows  often in ways that are difficult to predict in particular as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue  expenses assets liabilities and cash flows  will generally  decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expense which will also decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue and expenses    assets liabilities and cash flows  will generally  increase when reported in us dollars for the fiscal year 2015  our revenue would have decreased by approximately 557 million and our operating income would have increased by approximately 08 million respectively if the us dollar exchange rate would have strengthened by 10 with all other variables held constant 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during the fiscal year 2015  we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge certain balance sheet exposures resulting from currency fluctuations

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp that are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities    utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

discovery  represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 1015 years up to 20 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in earlystage drug research   in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster our clients reduce their costs increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in earlystage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services 

for nearly 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services which now encompasses the broader earlystage drug research process our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate approximately 60 facilities in 17 countries worldwide which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions is sites our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our clients to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2014 our total revenue from continuing operations was 13 billion  and our operating income from continuing operations was 1777 million  

we have three reporting segments research models and services rms discovery and safety assessment dsa and manufacturing support manufacturing 

through our rms segment we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with over 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice   we  also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including barrier rooms andor isolator facilities in 2014 rms accounted for 391  of our total revenue from continuing operations and approximately 3100 of our employees including approximately 70 science professionals with advanced degrees 

our dsa business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their drug discovery research their critical regulatoryrequired safety assessment testing and related drug discovery and development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies that exceeded their internal capacity and by the needs of biotechnology companies who traditionally outsourced all of their discovery and development programs global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their discovery and development activities because outsourcing reduces or eliminates the significant investment in personnel facilities and other capital resources necessary to efficiently and effectively conduct required scientific studies 

we are one of the two largest providers of drug discovery and preclinical development services worldwide and offer target discovery to investigational new drug submission drug discovery with particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of safety assessment studies we currently provide discovery and safety assessment services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada europe and japan our dsa segment represented 415  of our total revenue from

continuing operations in 2014 and employed approximately 3400 of our employees including approximately 590 science professionals with advanced degrees 

through our manufacturing segment we help ensure the safe production and release of products manufactured by our clients our endotoxin and microbial detection business provides nonanimal or in vitro  methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination our avian vaccine services business provides specific pathogen free spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens for the manufacture of live viruses our biologics testing services business provides specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 

in 2014 manufacturing accounted for 194  of our total revenue from continuing operations and approximately 1100 of our employees including approximately 50 science professionals with advanced degrees 

in recent years we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service “onestop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts   it is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is approximately 45 to 50 outsourced while emerging growth areas such as in vivo  discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced 

research models and services rms   our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models and 2 research model services 

research models   our research models business is comprised   of the production and sale of research models 

research models  a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies and many government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions    we have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in 8 countries in close proximity to our clients our research models include standard stocks and strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our research models include 

 

certain of our research models are proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research oncology central nervous system metabolic cardiovascular and renal diseases 

we are also a premier provider of high quality purpose bred specificpathogenfree spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

research model services  rms also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients use of research models in screening drug candidates these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models and managing research operations for government entities academic organizations and commercial clients we 

 3 

currently have three service offerings in research models services  genetically engineered models and services insourcing solutions and research animal diagnostic services 

genetically engineered models and services gems   we breed and maintain research models purchased or purposefully created by our clients for biomedical research activities the creation of a genetically engineered model gem is a critical scientific event but it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support early discovery research we also provide breeding expertise and colony development quarantine health and genetic monitoring germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation including assisted reproduction our team of project managers is supported by a technologically advanced internet based colony management system that allows for real time data exchange we provide these services to clients around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities 

insourcing solutions is   we manage research operations including recruitment training staffing and management services for government entities academic organizations and commercial clients research institutions prefer to outsource staffing and management while retaining certain elements of their research inhouse thus driving demand for our services we believe that our expertise in earlystage drug research and in particular research model care scientific and technical support facility operations and discovery and development services enhances the productivity and quality of our clients research programs 

research animal diagnostic services rads   we monitor and analyze the health profiles of the research models and cell lines of our clients we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic needs of our research model business we are able to serve as our clients solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting our clients’ internal laboratory capabilities we believe we are the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of animal diagnostics we also offer nonglp biomarker assay platforms and services to support earlystage discovery studies across these platforms we can provide both standard as well as customized biomarker testing including serum and urine chemistries 

discovery and safety assessment dsa 

we currently offer discovery and safety assessment services both regulated and nonregulated in which we include both in vivo  and in vitro  studies supporting laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development 

discovery services   we offer a full spectrum of discovery services from identification of a druggable target within a cell through delivery of clinical drug candidates in 2014 we integrated our early discovery and in vivo  discovery businesses into a single business line  discovery services  as part of our continued efforts to streamline and enhance the support we can provide for clients’ integrated drug discovery programs one seamless discovery organization allows us to better engage with clients at the earliest stages of drug discovery and support complex scientific needs we support a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology cns bone and musculoskeletal inflammation metabolic diseases respiratory cardiovascular gastrointestinal genitourinary and ophthalmology   as we look forward we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of drug discovery applications and platforms from target discovery to candidate selection

 4 

safety assessment we offer a full range of discovery and safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with biologics the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis in support of preclinical studies we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects these studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

toxicology   toxicology is one of our nonclinical competencies and a competitive strength we have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of both chemicallyderived small molecule and biotechnologyderived large molecule pharmaceuticals once a lead molecule is selected toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans and new drug registrations these toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the molecule to determine if administration of the molecules to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects these studies are typically performed in research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods our toxicology services feature 

 

our discovery and safety assessment facilities comply with good laboratory practices glps to the extent required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies furthermore our earlystage discovery work which is not subject to glp standards is typically carried out under a quality management system such as iso 9100 our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities our clients quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program 

pathology services   the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics key “gonogo” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of fluid tissue and cellular changes that our experts identify and interpret for our clients we employ a large number of highly trained veterinary anatomic and clinical pathologists and other scientists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells in addition to all standard anatomic and clinical pathology techniques we provide specialized evaluations such as cytology platelet function assay development immunohistochemistry in situ  hybridization and electron microscopy services

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients we drive our growth by providing our clients superior flexible and tailored solutions to help them accelerate and enhance the efficiency of their drug research and development efforts our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and earlystage development products services and solutions to support our clients goal to maintain the flexible infrastructure that they require to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively in addition we believe we can improve and augment drug discovery and development effectiveness by coordinating the dialog between large pharmaceutical biotechnology academic and nongovernmental organizations and venture capitalists as these groups increasingly rely and 

 6 

interact with one another in this field we assist them in working together by developing deeper strategic relationships with each of these constituencies 

we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio  we are the only large global contract research organization cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses almost exclusively on drug discovery and earlystage development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment and toxicology studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapies will progress from discovery to development we continue to work alongside them as the drug candidates move downstream our recognized expertise in earlystage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage we understand our clients therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

deep scientific expertise  we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities that our clients demand but are not perceived as strategic differentiators for their businesses these include biomarkers biologics pharmacology immunology pathology and other specialty areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain inhouse we continue to increase our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology respiratory bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular infectious disease central nervous system synthetic and medicinal chemistry library design cell line development in vitro  and in vivo  screening structural biology process chemistry scale up and formulation development 

commitment to animal welfare we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support we maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions each of our clients is different with unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and we can deliver customized solutions based upon the breadth and depth of our capabilities expertise and services we help clients improve their workload and staffing requirements by drawing upon the higher utilization and streamlined efficiencies of our facilities this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to fit the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner  we believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of research models and associated services discovery and preclinical in vivo  and in vitro  services and manufacturing support on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work their preference is to partner with large tier 1 cros like charles river who can offer clients access to greater value through economics of scale and scope as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider by building and expanding broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery and development processes for example over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with 

 7 

leading global pharmaceutical companies and we have expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global pharmaceutical companies for some of these partners we provide a broad suite of our research models and discovery and safety assessment services and for others we provide a customized and select array of discovery and safety assessment services and or research models utilizing our capabilities enables our clients to create a flexible research platform to deliver innovative health solutions 

we believe it is critical to participate in that process now because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time from three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities to do this we are positioning ourselves as the preferred partner for outsourced drug discovery and earlystage development products and services 

we developed this strategy and focus in recognition of our clients needs biopharmaceutical companies continue to face increasing pressure to innovate and to better manage their pipelines accordingly our clients have reduced their infrastructure while simultaneously they search for improved ways to identify and develop innovative new therapies clients are reducing historical fixed costs in favor of a more flexible business model with an aim to accelerate their discovery and development activities as a consequence our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients have been looking to outsource these services to high quality fullservice providers like us our business prospects are driven primarily by this trend towards the virtualization and externalization of our clients through partnering and outsourcing client spending is not just influenced by the levels of research and development at these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies but also by spending of all the sponsors including federal and state governments and nonprofit organizations by providing clients with an outsourced suite of robust services from drug discovery to postind we allow them to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on areas that provide true differentiation and advance their pipelines this creates opportunities for us to help optimize our clients pipelines and be a true partner in accelerating their drug discovery and development efforts 

in recent years the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have faced a collection of challenges this involves scientific publicperception economic and regulatory challenges that all have negatively affected demand and pricing for outsourced discovery and preclinical development services these challenges included 

 

as a result there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process this has reduced the number of molecules moving into preclinical and clinical development and results in fewer molecules undergoing regulated safety assessment the result is a greater focus on discovery services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonglp dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means of meeting their discovery and safety assessment needs    with the stabilization of factors addressed above as well as the successful launch of new therapies and the need to advance earlystage pipelines we believe outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be a positive driver 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products 

 8 

and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research and development efficiency and cost effectiveness 

to address the challenging market conditions that have persisted over the last few years we have taken significant steps to better support our clients identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operational efficiency and productivity drive cost savings and generally strengthen our business model 

 

we maintain an intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and better positioned ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment as a result we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities as clients particularly larger pharmaceutical companies increase their outsourcing we believe that our broad portfolio and global footprint allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them we are able to build and maintain expertise and achieve economies of scale that are difficult for our clients to match within their internal infrastructures because these products and services are the core of our business 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate on return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital for example in 2014 we made two significant strategic acquisitions first in march 2014 we acquired argenta and biofocus global leaders in integrated drug discovery services located in the united kingdom and the netherlands with a predominant focus on in vitro  capabilities second in october 2014 we acquired chantest a premier provider in ion channel testing 

our acquisition strategy also takes into account geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services for example in 2013 we acquired 75 ownership of vital river the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in china as a result of this acquisition we now provide more of our highquality research models and associated services to emerging asian markets for drug discovery and development our strategy also includes strengthening the depth and expanding the breadth of our core capabilities and services in a related or adjacent business such as the vivopath and brass acquisitions in 2013 and the accugenix acquisition in 2012 

we are also partnering with a number of venture capital firms investing in life sciences health care and technology companies with an emphasis on earlystage emerging growth companies through these partnerships and leveraging our core competencies we are able to promote contract research services for discovery and safety assessment to these companies this offers us the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

customers 

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies contract research organizations agricultural and chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2014 no single commercial client accounted for more than 5 of our total revenue 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midtier clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships these structured relationships incentivize clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio and in total the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent more than 25 of our total revenues this provides us with better visibility than in the past and because of the strength of these relationships better insight into our clients planning processes for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 13 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding revenue and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 13 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in earlystage drug research quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

the competitive landscape for our three business segments varies 

 10 

 

we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals and implementation of the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs and help to reduce the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability whenever possible we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents microsampling and in vitro  assays we also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field and the supporters of 3rs 

employees 

as of december 27 2014 we had approximately 7900 employees including approximately 700 science professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are represented by unions or works councils at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and feedback 

backlog 

our backlog for our rms dsa and manufacturing reportable segments was 1157 million 3105 million and 275 million respectively at december 27 2014 as compared to 1387 million 2031 million and 281 million respectively at december 28 2013 related services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a 

 11 

study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies or projects that are included in 2014 backlog may be completed in 2015 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies or projects may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the united states other than laboratory rats mice and chickens as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research 

we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda and similar agencies in other countries such as the european union china japan and canada for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities in the us our dsa facilities in the us canada and most of our dsa sites in the european union are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom health canada and other similar agencies in the countries we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

our manufacturing support businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability sterility and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions including national regional and local laws relating to 

 12 

 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and conducts regular audits of our quality assurance functions for all of our glp good clinical practices and cgmp facilities to assure these compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies or manufacturing studies 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our emd   testing business including accugenix and the endosafepts we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 eight of the nine members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the “investor relationscorporate governance” caption 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties   

the outsourcing trend in preclinical discovery and safety assessment stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

 13 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities such as discovery and safety assessment while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development   decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phases of research and development and in particular discovery and safety assessment and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets    similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the spending by our global pharmaceutical clients has been directed towards their therapies in latestage clinical rather than earlystage preclinical development as they work to replenish drug pipelines to offset the effect of patent expirations on sales furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business    

a portion of revenue in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results   also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

 14 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control the department of transportation the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih as well as numerous other canadian european and asian oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

the fda is in the process of reviewing and modernizing the glp regulations to reflect current industry standards as this may change some of the glp requirements the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued 

we are at risk that changes in us government practices may negatively affect our business since it is a significant customer of ours for example in 2014 the national cancer institute nci canceled a 10year 112 million contract that was originally initiated in 2006 which had two years remaining under the contract we produced nci research models for academic and government researchers in an effort to mitigate the effect of the cancellation we launched an outreach program to inform researchers that they could continue to obtain the nci models from us with no change in initial pricing or logistics from a revenue standpoint we received between 10 and 11 million annually to produce the models and expect that we will retain approximately half of that amount from direct sales to researchers 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and 

 15 

may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably the european directive 201063eu requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017 some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

  16 

 

if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under ‑ price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations    

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles to the extent goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles are impaired their carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 27 2014 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles was 5000 million  on our consolidated balance sheet 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the us our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf of our total revenue in recent years    we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

  17 

 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test platforms in biomedical research as well as improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and viceversa some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro  technologies such as human materials stem cell technology and model creation technology however the increasing availability and utility of these in vitro  models is partially offset by these technologies facilitating the creation of humanized highly specialized and specific disease mimicking models we can produce 

it is our strategy to explore nonanimal approaches to reduce the need for animal models as these new methods become validated for example chantest has a welldeveloped program to evaluate the cardiac properties of induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes we may not be successful in commercializing these methods and furthermore revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders in some instances periodic demonstrations at our operating sites occur any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

 18 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

 

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us and international tax law 

in the us there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits implementing a territorial regime of taxation limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and reducing the ability to defer us tax on offshore earnings these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and effective tax rate 

currently the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting beps this initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france germany and the united kingdom future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

 19 

 

while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our dsa and manufacturing businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified subject to a limitation of liability by insurance maintained by our clients andor by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients subject to a limitation of liability similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage either at all or on terms acceptable to us 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain different sites worldwide with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from thirdparties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends  in part  on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or 

 20 

at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 27 2014 we had 7538 million  of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 7 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer    

during the past fifteen years we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 

in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

 21 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for almost four decades we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 

we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

we own or lease the land and buildings where we have facilities we own large facilities facilities over 50000 square feet for our dsa businesses in canada ireland scotland and the united states and lease large facilities in england and the united states we own large rms facilities in canada china france germany japan england and the united states we own large manufacturing segment facilities in the united states and china none of our leases is individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew  and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us     we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available when needed for additional information see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

capacity at our safety assessment businesses within our dsa segment is primarily based on physical room infrastructure designed towards meeting specific scientific and regulatory requirements we track room utilization on an ongoing basis and depending on the needs of our clients at given times we may need to execute on contingent plans for expansion which average between six and fifteen months to complete 

we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy   we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not party to any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition 

in early may 2013 with the assistance of the law firm of davis polk  wardwell llp the company commenced an investigation of inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts this issue had been reported to the company’s senior management by a charles river employee the company promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers the department of health and human services office of the inspector general and the department of justice and is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter 

the investigation to date has confirmed that the company’s rms business segment billed the department of health and human services for certain work that had not been performed with respect to a small subset of the company’s government contracts it has been determined that when employees regularly assigned to work in research model barrier rooms associated with these contracts were absent other employees names would be substituted on timekeeping records associated with the relevant contracts the company billed the government for the hours associated with these substitute employees despite the fact that in many cases these employees did not perform any services in connection with the relevant government contracts based on the findings of the investigation to date the company believes that this conduct was limited to the company’s research model facilities in raleigh north carolina and kingston new york the company has identified approximately 15 million in excess amounts billed on these contracts since january 1 2007 and has reserved such amount at december 27 2014 given the current status of discussions with the government and the complex nature of this matter the company cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such reserve 

the company has already taken appropriate steps to prevent this conduct from recurring and will consider additional remedial measures following the conclusion of the investigation

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentage changes from period over period may not recalculate due to rounding 

overview 

we are a full service earlystage contract research organization cro for nearly 70 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our original core competency laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services both good laboratory practice glp and nonglp that are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market 

our client base includes primarily of all of the major global pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies contract research organizations agricultural and chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies around the world we currently operate approximately 60 facilities in 17 countries worldwide which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions is sites 

business trends 

the demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2014 as did demand for products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally many of our large biopharmaceutical clients are beginning to refocus on their drug discovery and earlystage development efforts after a period of stronger emphasis on delivering latestage programs to bring new drugs to market in addition midtier biopharmaceutical clients benefited from a resurgence in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2014 from both capital markets and partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies academia has also benefited from partnering activities as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities 

the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2014 particularly from midtier clients this improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment business in which utilization is beginning to approach optimal levels our targeted sales efforts also generated continued market shares gains price remained competitive but trends are stable to slightly improving we believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us in order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients’ needs we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2014 at existing facilities and continue to strategically evaluate further capacity additions 

our clients’ intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs to address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum we acquired the early discovery businesses of argenta biofocus chantest and vivopath in the fiscal year 2014 which has enabled us to work with clients at the earliest stage of the discovery process our full service earlystage portfolio has led to additional client discussions regarding strategic relationships in the fiscal year 2014 where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their earlystage drug research programs to us 

while demand for research models and certain services remained constrained in the fiscal year 2014 as clients’ continued to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity we remain confident that the longterm drivers of our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients demand for discovery and safety assessment services and research models and services which remain essential to the earlystage drug research process as well as our products and services that support our clients’ manufacturing activities including endotoxin and microbial detection 

 28 

acquisitions 

during the fiscal year 2014 we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and earlystage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market the 2014 acquisitions include 

 

segment reporting 

in the second quarter of 2014 following our acquisition of argenta and biofocus we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business we reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business the recently revised gotomarket strategy longterm operating margins and the discrete financial information available to our chief operating decision maker and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors based on this review we identified three reportable segments research models and services rms discovery and safety assessment dsa and manufacturing support manufacturing we reported segment results on this basis for the current period and retrospectively for all comparable prior periods 

the revised reportable segments are as follows 



1  research model services includes genetically engineered models and services gems research animal diagnostic services rads and is 

2  discovery services includes both the early discovery and in vivo  discovery businesses early discovery includes argenta biofocus and chantest 

our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models as well as the supply of large research models research model services includes three business units gems which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models rads which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models and is which provides management of our clients’ research operations including recruitment training staffing and management services our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services which are nonregulated services to assist clients with the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for drug development and regulated and nonregulated safety assessment services our manufacturing segment includes endotoxin and microbial detection emd which includes  in vitro  nonanimal lotrelease testing products and microbial detection and species identification services biologics testing services biologics which performs specialized testing of biologics and devices and avian vaccine services avian which supplies specificpathogenfree fertile chicken eggs and chickens 

prior to recasting the reportable segments the businesses were reported in two segments as follows 



 29 

3  research models included avian vaccine services 

4 research model services included gems rads is and discovery research services as part of the segment revisions the former discovery research services was been folded into our discovery services business previously located under the preclinical services segment 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on our historical experience trends in the industry and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that our application of the following accounting policies each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been provided our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract in cases where performance spans reporting periods revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known changes in scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above 

most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project fees earned to date or in some cases a termination fee such payments are included in revenues when earned 

we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria 

income taxes 

we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations in preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets in performing this assessment we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies our estimates of future taxable income include 

 30 

among other items our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options in the event that actual results differ from our estimates we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

we account for uncertain tax positions using a “morelikelythannot” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax law the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns the effective settlement of matters subject to audit information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “morelikelythannot” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would reexamine the related tax position we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

as of december 27 2014 our nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated 2710 million  all undistributed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no net income tax expense or which were previously taxed under current us tax law are reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us this determination is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the us and within our foreign subsidiaries if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs the resulting tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of intangible assets typically key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 

we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we elect this option and believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable the quantitative twostep impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required alternatively we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative twostep impairment test in the first step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

 31 

in the fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

our 2014 2013 and 2012 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired 

in 2014 we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the argenta and biofocus acquisition as a result of this reorganization goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit in addition we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets to be held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 

determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset net of any sublease income if applicable and its eventual disposition in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets the assets are writtendown to their fair values we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets during the fiscal year 2014 we did not record any significant impairment charges to longlived assets 

pension and other retiree benefit plans 

several of our us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end 

the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets discount rate and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the relative weighting of plan assets the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 

the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase highquality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations in the fiscal year 2014 as part of our annual review of assumptions for our us pension and retiree benefit plans we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary bondlink tool prior to the fiscal year 2014 we employed a cashflow matching methodology which 

 32 

used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index the refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model we believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner this refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of december 27 2014 by 55 million 

the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy 

in the fiscal year 2014 for our us plans we adopted new mortality tables rp2014 and a new mortality improvement scale mp2014 which increased our benefit obligations by 60 million as of december 27 2014 we previously used the rp2000 mortality tables with mortality improvements projected using scale aa to 2021 for annuitants and to 2029 for nonannuitants in addition for our uk plans the mortality table was updated to s2 series saps using the cmi 2013 core projection with a 125 per annum longterm mortality improvement this update increased our benefit obligations by 19 million as of december 27 2014 prior to the fiscal year 2014 we used the s1 series saps mortality table and the cmi 2009 core projection with a 125 per annum longterm improvement the new mortality information reflects improved life expectancies and an expectation that the trend will continue 

stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and performance share units psus to employees and stock options and restricted stock to nonemployee directors under stockbased compensation plans we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stockbased compensation arrangements changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments 

determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the blackscholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term among others 

determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu’s performance targets requires judgment including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change 

we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing sharebased compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ or are expected to materially differ from our estimates

cash flows 

the following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities 



the increases in cash provided by operating activities from the fiscal years 2013  to 2014  and from the fiscal years 2012  to 2013  were due to increases in our income from continuing operations with the net effect of changes in assets and liabilities and adjustments to net income from continuing operations our days sales outstanding which includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation was 52 days as of december 27 2014  compared to 56 days as of december 28 2013  and 51 days as of december 29 2012

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 27 2014  are as follows 



  40 

expect to make to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans we note that actual payments to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors that may change in future years such as expected retirement age rate of compensation increases medical trend rates mortality assumptions etc our funding for pension plans is consistent with applicable laws and regulations 

 

tax related obligations 

we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities as of december 27 2014  we have 346 million  of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements including offbalance sheet arrangements as described in sec regulation sk item 303 as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities as of december 27 2014 our debt portfolio was comprised primarily of floating interest rate borrowings a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual pretax interest expense by approximately 93 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results often in ways that are difficult to predict in particular as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the value of our nonus revenue will decline when reported in us dollars the impact to net income as a result of a us dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of nonus expense which will also decline when reported in us dollars as the us dollar weakens versus other currencies the value of the nonus revenue and expenses will increase when reported in us dollars 

we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy we do not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

during 2014  we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge certain balance sheet exposures resulting from currency fluctuations no foreign currency contracts were open at december 27 2014

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the earlystage drug discovery and development process the focus of our business is in vivo  biology our portfolio includes research models and services required to enable in vivo  drug discovery and development 

discovery  represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 1015 years up to 20 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our core competency in in vivo  biology in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster our clients reduce their costs increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in earlystage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services 

for over 65 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world      we currently operate approximately 68 facilities in 16 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our clients to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2013 our net sales from continuing operations were 12 billion and our operating income from continuing operations was 1514 million 

we have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs 

through our rms segment we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with over 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice we  also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including barrier rooms andor isolator facilities in 2013 rms accounted for 607  of our total net sales from continuing operations and approximately 52 of our employees including approximately 108 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

our pcs business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired safety assessment and related drug development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies that exceeded their internal capacity and by the needs of biotechnology companies who traditionally outsourced all of their development programs global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their development activities because a significant investment in personnel facilities and other capital resources is required to efficiently and effectively conduct these required scientific studies outsourcing allows them to focus on their core competencies of innovation early drug discovery promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical including both discovery and development services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of safety assessment studies especially those dealing with large molecule biologics and other innovative therapies we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada and europe our pcs segment represented 393 of our total net sales from continuing operations in 2013 and employed 44 of our employees including approximately 365 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees

we provide discovery services in both our rms and pcs business segments the biopharmaceutical industry continues to reduce infrastructure and search for more efficient and costeffective models of drug discovery and development in particular large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are outsourcing drug discovery research an area they historically considered a core competency these services which are generally nonregulated are used by sponsors to screen molecules and make earlier “gono go” decisions as to which molecules should be selected for continued investment 

in recent years we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service “onestop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts   it is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is approximately 40 to 50 outsourced while emerging growth areas such as in vivo  discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced 

research models and services rms   our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 endotoxin and microbial detection 

research models   our research models business is comprised   of the production and sale of research models and avian vaccine services 

research models  a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions    we have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in 8 countries in close proximity to our clients our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide

safety assessment we offer a full range of preclinical studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with biologics the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis in support of preclinical studies we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects these studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

toxicology   toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength we have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of both traditional “small molecule” pharmaceuticals and biotechnologyderived pharmaceuticals once a lead molecule is selected toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans these toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the molecule to determine if administration of the molecules to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects these studies are typically performed in research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods our toxicology services feature 

  5 

our preclinical facilities comply with good laboratory practices glps to the extent required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities our clients quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program 

pathology services   the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety of potential new therapeutics key “gonogo” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology changes that our experts identify and interpret for our clients we employ a large number of highly trained veterinary anatomic and clinical pathologists and other scientists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells in addition to all standard anatomic and clinical pathology techniques we provide specialized evaluations such as immunohistochemistry evaluations that are often required in the development of monoclonal antibodies 

biologics testing solutions fka biopharmaceutical services   we perform specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our laboratories in the united states germany scotland and ireland provide timely and compliant molecular biology virology bioanalysis immunochemistry microbiology and related services we confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this testing is required by the fda and other international regulatory authorities for our clients to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we further design and provide viral clearance projects for phase i ii and iii studies in our german and us facilities 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients we drive our growth by providing our clients superior flexible and tailored solutions to help them accelerate and enhance the efficiency of their drug research and development efforts our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of earlystagedrug discovery and development products services and solutions to support our clients goal to maintain the flexible infrastructure that they require to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio  we are the only large global contract research organization cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses almost exclusively on earlystage drug discovery and preclinical development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment and toxicology studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from early lead generation through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapies will progress or remain in development we continue to work alongside them as the drug candidates move downstream through the preclinical development process and postcandidate selection our recognized expertise in in vivo  biology and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage we understand our clients therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism and safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

deep scientific expertise  we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities that our clients demand but are not perceived as strategic differentiators for their businesses these include biomarkers biologics pharmacology immunology pathology and other specialty areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients to maintain inhouse we continue to increase our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology respiratory bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular infectious disease and central nervous system 

commitment to animal welfare we are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research 

superior quality and client support we maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity these standards allow clients to access our global 

 6 

portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions all of our clients are different each has unique needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and we can deliver customized work based upon the breadth and depth of our capabilities expertise and services we help clients improve their workload and staffing requirements by drawing upon the higher utilization and streamlined efficiencies of our facilities this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to fit the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a fullservice integrated partner over a longer period of time 

large global partner  we believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of discovery and preclinical in vivo  products and services on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work their preference is to partner with tier 1 cros who can bring experience in project management to a portfolio of projects large cros like charles river can present clients with access to greater value through economies of scale and scope this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider by building and expanding broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery and development processes for example over the past few years we have entered into strategic relationships with leading global pharmaceutical companies and we have expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global pharmaceutical companies for some of these partners we provide a broad suite of our research models and preclinical services and for others we provide a customized and select array of preclinical services and or research models utilizing our capabilities enables our clients to create a flexible research platform to deliver innovative health solutions 

we believe it is critical to participate in that process now because these relationships are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time from three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros at the conclusion of the initial relationship our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities to do this we are positioning ourselves as the preferred partner for outsourced earlystage drug discovery and development products and services 

  

we developed this strategy and focus in recognition of our clients needs biopharmaceutical companies continue to face increasing pressure to innovate and to better manage their pipelines accordingly our clients have reduced their infrastructure while simultaneously they search for improved ways to identify and develop innovative new therapies clients are reducing historical fixed costs in favor of a more flexible business model with an aim to accelerate their discovery and development activities as a consequence our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients have been looking to outsource these services to high quality fullservice providers like us our business prospects are driven primarily by this trend towards the virtualization and externalization of our clients through partnering and outsourcing client spending is not just influenced by the levels of research and development at these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies but also by spending of all the sponsors including federal and state governments and other nonprofit organizations by providing clients with an outsourced suite of robust services from drug discovery to postind we allow them to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on areas that provide true differentiation and advance their pipelines this creates opportunities for us to help optimize our clients pipelines and be a true partner in accelerating their drug discovery and development process 

in recent years the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have faced a collection of challenges this involves scientific publicperception economic and regulatory challenges that all have negatively affected demand and pricing for outsourced discovery and preclinical development services these challenges included 

  

  7 

 

as a result there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process this has reduced the number of compounds moving into preclinical and clinical development and results in fewer molecules undergoing regulated safety assessment the result is a greater focus on discovery research services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonregulated dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery research services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug research decision processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with cros as a means to meeting their discovery program needs    with the stabilization of factors addressed above as well as the successful launch of new therapies and the need to advance earlystage pipelines we believe outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be a positive driver    

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research and development efficiency and cost effectiveness 

to address the challenging market conditions that have persisted over the last few years we have taken significant steps to better support our clients identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiency and generally strengthen our business model

is responsible for transitioning from the unified regional business alignment which was implemented in 2011 to a more fully integrated global organizational structure across north america europe and asia 

in addition to these actions over the past few years we have taken decisive actions to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency such as lean six sigma the profit improvement program and enhanced focus on procurement general and administrative expenses and operations these actions were designed to streamline and optimize our operating processes and infrastructure to allow us to support our clients more efficiently and at a lower cost we have an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment we have continued to make progress in 2013 on these key initiatives which include 1 improving our consolidated operating margin 2 improving our free cash flow generation 3 investing in those businesses with the greatest potential for growth and 4 returning value to shareholders 

we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities in light of our actions and intensified focus as clients particularly larger pharmaceutical companies increase their outsourcing we believe that our expertise allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them we are able to build and maintain expertise and achieve economies of scale that are difficult for our clients to match within their internal infrastructures because these products and services are the core of our business 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the earlystage drug discovery and development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate on return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital 

this strategy may include geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services for example in january 2013 we acquired 75 ownership of vital river the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in china as a result of this acquisition we now provide more of our highquality research models and associated services to emerging asian markets for drug discovery and development our strategy also includes strengthening the depth and expanding the breadth of our core capabilities and services in a related or adjacent business such as the accugenix acquisition in 2012 

we are also partnering with a limited number of venture capital firms investing in life sciences health care and technology companies with an emphasis on early stage emerging growth companies through these partnerships and leveraging our core competencies we are able to promote contract research services for discovery and preclinical services to these companies this offers us the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group which has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines 

customers 

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

   

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies contract research organizations agricultural and chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2013 no single commercial client accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midtier clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships these structured relationships incentivize clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio and in total the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent slightly more than 25 of our total revenues this provides us with better visibility than in the past and because of the strength of these relationships better insight into our clients planning processes for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 11 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united

sales marketing and customer support 

we have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments ie global biopharmaceutical small and midsized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and government institutions this enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams who work in north america europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters webinars and making presentations at and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain areas our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents particularly with respect to our emd   and biologics testing solutions businesses 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of in vivo  biology are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition 

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in in vivo  biology quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

   

we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

 10 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care 

we are firmly committed to the 3rs replacement reduction and refinement and help to reduce the number of animals used by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability we also partner with customers to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 28 2013 we had approximately 7700 employees including approximately 660 professionals with advanced scientific degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have good relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and employee surveys 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment from continuing operations was 2138 million at december 28 2013 as compared to 2139 million at december 29 2012 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders as backlog canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog we do not report backlog for our rms business segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2013 backlog may be completed in 2014 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the united states other than laboratory rats mice and chickens as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals separately facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the us public health service phs must also adhere to the phs policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and follow the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals produced by the institute for laboratory animal research ilar

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities 

we conduct nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients products throughout the world many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency ema medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada and other similar agencies in the countries we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities in addition the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture distribution andor marketing of particular products 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and conducts regular audits of our quality assurance functions to assure these compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our emd   testing business including accugenix and the endosafepts we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 eight of the nine members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties   

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development   decreases in preclinical outsourcing activity may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in this form 10k furthermore our client contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets    similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the spending by our global pharmaceutical clients has been directed towards their therapies in latestage clinical rather than earlystage preclinical development as they work to replenish drug pipelines to offset the effect of patent expirations on sales furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 13 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 2010 and 2014 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results as it did in 2013    also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide  

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora us fish and wildlife service the centers for disease control and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation the court’s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited to 1 expansion of access to health insurance coverage 2 expansion of the medicaid program 3 enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and 4 imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from certain state governments conservative advocacy groups and some small business organizations we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

the fda is in the process of reviewing and modernizing the glp regulations to reflect current industry standards as this may change some of the glp requirements the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely 

 14 

impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us in recent years the fda has significantly increased the number of warning letters regarding drug products if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably the european directive 201063eu requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017 some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

 15 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 

if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 28 2013 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles was 3152  million on the consolidated balance sheet 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the us our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf of our total net sales in recent years   we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

 16 

 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example as mentioned above we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery development and manufacturing process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for our 2012 and 2013 annual meetings in some instances periodic demonstrations at our operating sites occur any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

  17 

   

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore between 2006 and 2008 both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area invested significantly in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing existing capacity and market demand where capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects can occur more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us tax law 

in the us there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits implementing a territorial regime of taxation limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and reducing the ability to defer us tax on offshore earnings these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

  18 

   

we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that we or a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test platforms in biomedical research as well as improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and viceversa some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies it is our strategy to explore nonanimal approaches to reduce the need for animal models as these new methods become validated we may not be successful in commercializing these methods and furthermore revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain different sites worldwide with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might 

 19 

have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and delays in completing our internal controls and financial audits could adversely affect our operating results and investor supplier and client confidence in our reported financial information 

if we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal controls we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information either of which could subject us to regulatory enforcement and other actions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations investor supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock our management assessment as of december 29 2012 revealed a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting due to the design and operation of certain controls over information technology business processes and financial reporting specifically we identified deficiencies with respect to controls over segregation of duties restricted access changes to vendor and customer master data transaction level and financial close controls we have since changed our internal controls to address this material weakness and concluded as of december 28 2013 that our internal controls related to our internal control over financial reporting were operating effectively 

although there can be no assurances we believe these enhancements and improvements as described in detail in item 9a of part ii of this form 10k when repeated in future periods will allow us to maintain effective controls over financial reporting nevertheless we may identify other significant deficiencies or material weaknesses which we may not be able to remediate in timely manner or at all 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings we believe our ability to inlicense new technologies from thirdparties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends  in part  on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products such as large research models disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 28 2013 we had approximately 664 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 5 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past decade we have expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms 

 20 

and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for 37 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant 

 21 

competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

   

we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments to be reported in response to item 1b 




 item 2 properties 

we own or lease the land and buildings where we have facilities we own large facilities facilities over 50000 square feet for our pcs businesses in canada ireland scotland and the united states and lease large facilities in the united states we own large rms facilities in canada china france germany japan england and the united states none of our leases is individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew  and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us     we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available when needed   for additional information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

in fiscal 2013 we initiated minor expansions at certain domestic pcs sites an international biologics testing solutions site certain international emd sites an international rms site and a domestic avian site and we consolidated certain domestic rms sites we have adequate capacity to meet the current needs of our pcs and rms clients and we do not currently anticipate significant expansion requirements however many of our facilities are built for specific purposes thus underutilized capacity may not be usable other than for the specific purposes without significant renovation and expense we may expand at specific sites if we determine that it is not feasible to utilize available capacity at existing or suspended sites we may also expand at specific sites in order to accommodate needs resulting from any consolidation strategy   we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations which could result in impairment charges in situations where the associated real estate is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not party to any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition 

in early may 2013 with the assistance of the law firm of davis polk  wardwell llp the company commenced an investigation of inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts this issue had been reported to the company’s senior management by a charles river employee the company promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers the department of health and human services office of the inspector general and the department of justice and is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter 

the investigation to date has confirmed that the company’s rms business segment billed the department of health and human services for certain work that had not been performed with respect to a small subset of the company’s government contracts it has been determined that when employees regularly assigned to work in research model barrier rooms associated with these contracts were absent other employees names would be substituted on timekeeping records associated with the relevant contracts the company billed the government for the hours associated with these substitute employees despite the fact that in many cases these employees did not perform any services in connection with the relevant government contracts based on the findings of the investigation to date the company believes that this conduct was limited to the company’s research model facilities in raleigh and kingston the company has identified approximately 15 million in excess amounts billed on these contracts since january 1 2007 and has reserved such amount because of the preliminary stage of discussions with the government and complex nature of this matter the company cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such reserve 

the company has already taken appropriate steps to prevent this conduct from recurring and will consider additional remedial measures following the conclusion of the investigation

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following managements discussion and analysis will help you understand our financial condition and results of operations the managements discussion and analysis is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology including laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of preclinical services both glp good laboratory practice and nonglp which address drug discovery and development utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market we have been in business for over 65 years and currently operate approximately 68 facilities in 16 countries worldwide 

beginning in late 2008 large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies undertook significant changes in their operations as they endeavored to improve the productivity of their drug development pipelines and at the same time streamline their infrastructures in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs our clients efforts had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of their measured research and development spending delays in decisions and commitments tight cost constraints and the resultant pressure on pricing and payment terms particularly in view of excess capacity in the contract research industry and a focus on latestage clinical testing as our clients accelerate their efforts to bring drugs to market in the face of expiration of patents on branded drugs there were other trends which also affected us unfavorably biotechnology companies experienced a period of decreased funding there was uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform initiatives and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries continued to consolidate 

while these factors have continued to contribute to demand uncertainty and impact sales there have been improvements in many of them large biopharmaceutical companies have made progress in their operating efficiency which have included closure of underutilized facilities this in turn has led to an increase in outsourcing as these clients have chosen to utilize our facilities and scientific expertise rather than maintaining inhouse capabilities 

as part of our clients efforts to improve pipeline productivity pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are emphasizing efficacy testing in order to eliminate molecules from the pipeline earlier in the drug development process this trend is visible in increasing demand for our nonglp in vivo  pharmacology and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics dmpk services in addition to outsourcing services to contract research organizations cros large biopharmaceutical companies are also partnering with biotechnology companies and academia in order to access their novel molecules and research capabilities as a result there has been a significant increase in funding for biotechnology companies and research institutions 2013 was a robust year for biotechnology funding as improvements in the capital markets provided additional funding for these companies 

as a result of these factors our market for products and services has stabilized in this environment our targeted sales strategies are resulting in sales growth 

as our clients increase focus on strategic outsourcing our scientific expertise operating efficiency information technology platforms and client data portals and ability to meet each clients individual needs strongly positions us to compete for business we believe we continue to win new or renewing existing strategic relationships in a highly competitive marketplace because of the industry characteristics noted above as well as our broad portfolio of products and services which span the earlystage drug development continuum and our ability to develop a customized in vivo  biology program to support our clients drug development efforts price continues to be a factor in our clients’ choice of strategic partners but we believe our scientific expertise remains a key criterion when our clients make the decision to eliminate inhouse capabilities and rely on a cro our clients are at different stages in the outsourcing process and we are in ongoing discussions concerning additional strategic relationships as our clients focus on the logistics of outsourcing additionally we continue to expand our relationships with our midtier and academic clients through focused sales and marketing efforts in order to achieve market share gains 

 29 

we believe that the longterm drivers for our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients continued demand for research models and services emd products and both glp and nonglp in vivo  biology services which are essential to the drug development process however presently it is challenging to predict the timing associated with these drivers 

we continue to focus on our four key initiatives which were designed to as cornerstones of the strategy to position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment and thus drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders these four initiatives are 1 improving our consolidated operating margin 2 improving free cash flow generation 3 disciplined investment in growth businesses and 4 returning value to shareholders 

our continued actions in 2013 toward the achievement of these initiatives include the following 

 total net sales in 2013  were 11655 million an increase of 32  from 11295  million in 2012  foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales of 08  we report two segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs sales increased in both our rms and pcs reportable segments 

our rms segment which represented 607  of net sales in 2013  includes three categories research models research model services and endotoxin and microbial detection emd research models includes production of small and large research models as well as avian products research model services include four business units genetically engineered models and services gems which performs contract breeding and associated services research animal diagnostics rads which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services discovery research services drs which provides nonregulated efficacy testing and insourcing solutions is which provides management services for our clients in vivo  operations our pcs segment which represented 393  of net sales in 2013  includes services required to take a drug through the development process including drs safety assessment and   biologics testing   services 

net sales for the rms segment increased 17  in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily driven by the acquisition of 75 of vital river and the resulting expansion of our research model sales in china and by continued growth of our emd business rms sales growth was partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a negative impact on sales of 12  and sales declines in our legacy research model production operations in the us europe and japan which offset net sales growth net sales for the pcs segment increased 55  year overyear driven by higher demand for our preclinical services partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency which decreased sales growth by 04  

our operating income was 1514 million for 2013  compared to operating income of 1658 million for 2012  the reduction in operating income was due to several factors including accelerated depreciation expense of 154 million related to two facilities in the us that were consolidated or vacated in 2013 

operating income for the rms segment was 1813  million in 2013 compared to 2024  million in 2012 operating income in the current year was negatively affected by accelerated depreciation of 135 million related to consolidation of a research model production facility in california and lower volume of research model sales in the us europe and japan operating income for the pcs segment increased to 441  million in 2013 compared to 346  million in 2012 the increase was driven by higher sales volume a favorable mix including longer term contracts and the benefit of efficiency initiates 

income from continuing operations net of tax was 1054 million  for 2013  compared to 1021 million  for 2012  for 2013  diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders were 212  compared to 201  in 2012  net income attributable 

 30 

to common shareholders increased to 1028 million in 2013  compared to 973 million in 2012  cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 were 2090 million  compared to 2080 million  in 2012 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

we consider the following accounting estimates important in understanding our operating results and financial condition for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1   description of business and summary of significant accounting policies 

valuation and impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and definitelived intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price in our business acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of longlived assets typically key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 

we test for goodwill impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed in the fourth quarter we have elected not to apply the guidance available in asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  to assess purely qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test for our reporting units as of the first day of fiscal november 2013 the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds fair value the second step would need to be performed otherwise no further step is required the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value our 2013 impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any reporting unit please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statement for further information on goodwill 

as noted above the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on our internal plans key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process if required measures the goodwill impairment by calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is 

 31 

determined similar to the manner in which goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including client relationships 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition should we determine that the carrying value of heldforuse longlived assets may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

longlived asset groups may be classified as heldforsale when the following conditions are met we have committed to a plan to sell the asset group and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan the asset group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and it is probable that the sale will be completed within one year and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and the asset group is being marketed at a sale price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value should we determine that the carrying value of heldforsale longlived assets exceeds its fair value we will measure any impairment based on this difference subsequent adjustments to the carrying amount of heldforsale assets based on changes in fair value are recorded but only to the extent of the carrying amount of the asset group when it entered the heldforsale category 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue related to our products which include research models emd technology and vaccine support products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally in the form of client purchase orders title and risk of loss have transferred which generally occurs upon delivery of the products the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured product sales are recorded net of returns upon delivery for large models in some cases clients pay in advance of delivery of the product these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product 

our service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts our service revenue is recognized upon the completion of the agreed upon performance criteria these performance criteria are generally in the form of either study protocols or specified activities or procedures that we are engaged to perform these performance criteria are established by our clients and do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to the total estimated costs to complete procedures specified by clients in the form of study protocols in general such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules but are recognized as revenue as services are performed revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known 

deferred and unbilled revenue are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the client and recognized as unbilled receivable as of december 28 2013  based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts we recorded unbilled revenue of 352 million  and deferred revenue of 542 million  in our consolidated balance sheet 

 32 

service revenue from our businesses can be categorized as follows 

 pension plan accounting 

our defined benefit pension plans assets liabilities and expenses are calculated by accredited independent actuaries using certain assumptions which are approved by management the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and to allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisers and actuaries the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date 

the estimated longterm return on plan assets is the average return expected on invested funds over the period in which future benefits are paid to pension plan participants we estimate the future return on invested pension assets annually based on information prepared by our outside actuaries and investment advisers we use several data points to estimate the longterm investment return including our targeted asset allocation capital market performance estimates prepared by our outside investment advisers survey information of rates of return used by other public companies and historical return information if the actual annual return is different from estimated longterm return on plan assets the difference is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is amortized to pension expense over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years   

the weighted average expected longterm return on plan assets as of 2013 2012 and 2011 are 63  66  and 68  respectively the expected return is intended to match the duration over which our pension plans will provide benefit payments to participants the duration of our largest plans the us plan and the uk plan which comprise approximately 90 of global plan assets as of december 28 2013 are approximately 14 and 22 years respectively for the years ended 2013 and 2012 our invested funds achieved returns of 120 and 108 respectively we acknowledge that there are limitations to historical returns in their use to predict future performance including annual volatility in the market and changes in our asset allocation 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards including stock options and restricted stock awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award at grant date all awards contain a service condition that requires the employee or director to provide services in order to vest in the award certain of our awards also contain performance andor market conditions for awards with performance conditions we recognize quarterly stockbased compensation based on the grantdate fair value of awards expected to vest based on the achievement of the performance condition for awards with market conditions we calculate the incremental fair value of the market condition at grant date 

 33 

stockbased compensation is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period net of estimated forfeiture for employee turnover we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option‑pricing model and we calculate the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility the expected life of the award the estimated achievement of performance conditions and the appropriate riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected life represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options the estimated achievement of performance conditions is based on our internal financial projections and the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated at least quarterly 

we record deferred tax assets for stockbased awards based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in our income statement at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction differences between the deferred tax assets and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paidin capital if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the long form method 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future we may need to increase or decrease income tax expense which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

as of december 28 2013  earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 2103 million  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us federal and state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes which could be material it is our policy to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our nonus subsidiaries unless they can be repatriated in a manner that generates a tax benefit or an unforeseen cash need arises in the united states and the earnings can be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax free determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable due to the complexities with the hypothetical calculation additionally the amount of the liability is dependent upon the circumstances existing if and when the remittance occurs 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our current and deferred tax provision is based upon enacted tax rates in effect for the current and future periods any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws and regulations or changes to interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured based upon the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments resolutions of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate

 35 



fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012 

net sales   net sales for the year ending december 28 2013  were 11655  million an increase of 360  million or 32  from 11295 million for the year ending december 29 2012  the increase in sales was driven by increases in the pcs business segment foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 08  on total sales growth 

research models and services   for the year ending december 28 2013  net sales for the rms segment were 7071 million an increase of 120  million or 17  from 6951 million for the year ending december 29 2012  the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of 75 of vital river in 2013 which increased our revenue in china the inclusion of a full year of accugenix services an emd service provider acquired in 2012 and an increase in legacy emd products globally these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of research models in our legacy production operations in the us europe and japan due primarily to infrastructure reductions by our global biopharmaceutical clients in addition unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased sales by 12  

preclinical services   for the year ending december 28 2013  net sales for our pcs segment were 4584 million an increase of 240 million or 55  from 4344 million for the year ending december 29 2012  foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 04  on sales growth net sales increased due to higher demand for our services from both global pharmaceutical and midtier biotechnology companies as well as a more favorable mix of longerterm services 

cost of products sold and services provided   cost of products sold and services provided during 2013  was 7664  million an increase of 325  million or 44  from 7339  million in 2012  cost of products sold and services provided for 2013  was 658  of net sales as compared to 650  for the year ending december 29 2012  

research models and services   cost of products sold and services provided for rms during 2013  was 4219  million an increase of 201 million or 50  compared to 4018 million in 2012  cost of products sold and services provided exclude asset impairment charges of 04 million and 35 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively which are discussed below the increase in cost of products sold and services provided was due to the acquisition of vital river which contributed 105 million to the increase and the acceleration of depreciation at our california facility which contributed 135 million to the increase partially offset by declines in cost of products sold in our legacy research model operations due to lower volume 

cost of products sold and services provided for the year ending 2013  increased to 597  of net sales compared to 578  of net sales for 2012  gross margins were down due to a decline in units sold from our legacy research model facilities in the us europe and japan as well as the accelerated depreciation expenses noted above 

 36

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships we include standard indemnification provisions in client contracts which include standard provisions limiting our liability under such contracts including our indemnification obligations with certain exceptions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet effective that will have a material impact our future consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we amended and restated our credit facility on may 29 2013 our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates that are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit agreement 

our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 96 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of the revenue from our foreign operations is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies additionally we have exposure on certain intercompany loans we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges 

 42 

during 2013 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on client transactions and certain balance sheet items including intercompany loans there were no foreign currency hedges outstanding as of december 28 2013

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the earlystage drug discovery and development process the focus of our business is in vivo  biology our portfolio includes research models and services required to enable in vivo  drug discovery and development 

discovery  represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 1015 years up to 20 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our core competency in in vivo  biology in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster our clients reduce their costs increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in earlystage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services 

for over 65 years we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world    we currently operate approximately 65 facilities in 15 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our clients to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2012 our net sales from continuing operations were 11 billion and our operating income from continuing operations was 1665 million 

we have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs 

through  our rms segment we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with over 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice we  also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including barrier rooms andor isolator facilities strategically located near our clients in 2012 rms accounted for 615 of our total net sales from continuing operations and approximately 50 of our employees including approximately 90 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

our pcs business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired safety assessment and related drug development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of larger global pharmaceutical companies global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their development activities because a significant investment in personnel facilities and other capital resources is required to efficiently and effectively conduct these activities outsourcing allows them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and particularly for pharmaceutical companies promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical including both discovery and development services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of safety assessment studies especially those dealing with large molecule biologics and other innovative therapies we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada and europe our pcs segment represented 385 of our total net sales from continuing operations in 2012 and employed 45 of our employees including approximately 430 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

we provide discovery services in both our rms and pcs business segments the biopharmaceutical industry continues to reduce infrastructure and search for more efficient and costeffective models of drug discovery and development in particular large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are outsourcing biopharmaceutical discovery research an area they historically considered a core competency these services which are generally nonregulated are used by sponsors to screen molecules and make earlier “gono go” decisions as to which molecules should be selected for continued investment 

in recent years we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service “onestop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts by some estimates the outsourced earlystage   drug discovery and development services markets in which we currently participate ranging from research model production to discovery services to regulated safety assessment is approximately 75 billion and in the aggregate is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue    it is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is approximately 40 outsourced while emerging growth areas such as in vivo  discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced 

research models and services rms   our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 endotoxin and microbial detection 

research models   our research models business is comprised   of the production and sale of research models and avian vaccine services 

a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions    we have 20 production facilities located in 7 countries worldwide which are strategically located in close proximity to our clients our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

 we also offer proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research oncology central nervous system metabolic cardiovascular and renal diseases 

we are a premier provider of high quality purpose bred specificpathogenfree spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

we are the global leader   for the supply of spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human and veterinary vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is performed under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence with several spf egg production facilities in the united states contracted production capabilities in hungary and franchise 

operations in india we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

research model services  rms also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients use of research models in screening drug candidates these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models and those which are designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the clients drug evaluation process we currently offer four major categories of research models services  genetically engineered models and services insourcing solutions discovery research services and research animal diagnostic services 

genetically engineered models and services gems   we breed and maintain research models purchased or purposefully created by our clients for biomedical research activities the creation of a genetically engineered model gem is a critical scientific event but it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support early discovery research our team of project managers is supported by a technologically advanced internet based colony management system that allows for real time data exchange we also provide breeding expertise and colony development quarantine health and genetic monitoring germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation including assisted reproduction we provide these services to clients around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities 

insourcing solutions is   we manage research operations including recruitment training staffing and management services for government entities academic organizations and commercial clients research institutions prefer to outsource staffing and management while retaining certain elements of their research inhouse thus driving demand for our services we believe that our expertise in in vivo  biology and in particular research model care facility operations and discovery and development services enhances the productivity and quality of our clients research model programs 

discovery research services drs drs represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development drs activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines we offer research and development expertise capabilities and services globally to accelerate our clients drug discovery pipelines from lead generation to candidate selection we complement clients capabilities and expertise to improve their decisionmaking increase their flexibility and reduce their internal costs and product development timelines we support a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology bone and muscoskeletal inflammation metabolic cardiovascular ophthalmology and cns diseases in addition we provide nontherapeutic support in a nonregulated environment to support lead optimization to candidate selection activities examples of this include early pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic studies and in vitro and in vivo assays to assess mechanism bioavailability metabolism and safety pharmacology as we look forward we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of drug discovery applications and platforms from target validation to candidate selection services performed at sites dedicated to discovery services are considered part of our research model services and part of our rms segment 

research animal diagnostic services rads   we monitor and analyze the health profiles of the research models and cell lines of our clients we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic needs of our research model business we are able to serve as our clients solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting our clients internal laboratory capabilities  we believe we are the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of animal diagnostics we can also offer nongxp biomarker assay platforms and services to support early stage discovery studies across these platforms we can provide both standard as well as customized biomarker testing including serum and urine chemistries 

endotoxin and microbial detection   emd fka in vitro  our emd business provides nonanimal or in vitro  methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination in addition with our acquisition of accugenix we provide our clients with stateoftheart microbial identification services for manufacturing in the biopharmaceutical medical device nutraceutical and consumer care industries 

endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and most successful fdavalidated alternative to an animal model test to date the extraction of blood does not harm the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our emd   business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to 

pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services which are used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured 

the growth in our emd   business is driven by our fda approved line of nextgeneration endotoxin testing products which are based on the endosafe portable testing system endosafe ® pts™ technology that allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment in recent years we expanded the pts product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the endosafe®mcs™ multi cartridge system to satisfy the demand of our clients who have higher volumes of tests to perform we anticipate our clients demand for rapid methods of testing will increase as they respond to the fdas process analytical technology pat initiative in november 2012 we introduced the first fully automated robotic system developed specifically for highvolume endotoxin testing endosafe®nexus™ we expect to start shipping the endosafe®nexus™ in 2013 we expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in nontraditional areas such as renal dialysis nuclear and compounding pharmacies and cellular therapy we are currently exploring obtaining 510k medical device approval of this technology for clinical diagnostic applications 

in 2012 our emd business acquired accugenix the premier global provider of cgmp compliant contract microbial identification testing accugenix is an acknowledged industry leader in specieslevel identification and strain typing of bacteria and fungi that are recovered from manufacturing facilities utilizing stateoftheart and proprietary in vitro  technologies coupled with scientific expertise and analysis accugenix excels in providing accurate timeeffective and costeffective microbial identification services required to meet internal quality standards and government regulations 

preclinical services pcs 

we currently offer preclinical services both regulated and nonregulated in which we include both in vivo  and in vitro  studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development we also provide drs activities at certain of our pcs sites including nonglp pharmacokinetics metabolism and pharmacology support to assist in the process of integrative drug candidate selection which we reported in our pcs segment 

safety assessment we offer a full range of preclinical studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis for preclinical study support we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects these studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

toxicology   toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected toxicology studies are conducted in support of clinical trials in humans these toxicology studies focus on safety and assess any harmful effects they are typically performed in research models to elucidate any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods our toxicology services feature 

 5 

 our preclinical facilities comply with good laboratory practices glps to the extent required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities our clients quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program 

pathology services   the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety of potential new therapeutics we employ a large number of highly trained veterinary pathologists and other scientists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical not only for regulatory safety assessment studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key “gonogo” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients 

biopharmaceutical services   we perform specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our laboratories in the united states germany scotland and ireland provide timely and compliant molecular biology virology bioanalytical immunochemistry microbiology and related services we confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this testing is required by the fda and other global regulatory authorities for our clients to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we further design and provide viral clearance projects for phase i ii and iii studies in our german and us facilities 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients we drive our growth by providing our clients superior flexible and tailored solutions to help them accelerate and enhance the efficiency of their drug research and development efforts our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of earlystagedrug discovery and development products services and solutions to support our clients goal to maintain the flexible infrastructure that they require to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

integrated earlystage portfolio  we are the only large global contract research organization cro with a portfolio of products services and solutions that focuses almost exclusively on earlystage drug discovery and preclinical development we provide research models and associated services discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment and toxicology studies in both regulated and nonregulated environments as such we are able to collaborate with clients from early lead generation through candidate selection when critical decisions are made regarding which therapies will progress or remain in development we continue to work alongside them as the drug candidates move downstream through the preclinical development process and postcandidate selection our recognized expertise in in vivo biology and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage in understanding our clients therapies and the challenges faced during the discovery and development process including mechanism of action efficacy drug metabolism and safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “gonogo” decisions 

deep scientific expertise  we provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise which may be too costly for our clients to build andor maintain inhouse we provide essential capabilities that our clients demand but are not perceived as strategic differentiators for their business these include biomarkers biology pharmacology immunology pathology and other specialty areas that have high infrastructure costs or are costprohibitive for clients 

to maintain inhouse we continue to increase our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients internal drug discovery and development areas of focus these areas of focus and expertise include oncology metabolism and obesity immunology bone and musculoskeletal diabetes cardiovascular infectious disease and central nervous system 

superior quality and client support we maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity these standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct research 

flexible and customized environment to provide the right solutions all of our clients are different each has individual needs and specific requirements we understand the importance of flexibility and we can deliver customized work based upon the breadth and depth of our capabilities expertise and services we help clients improve their workload and staffing requirements by drawing upon the higher utilization and streamlined efficiencies of our facilities this allows our clients to reduce internal capacity andor staff we leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated earlystage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to fit the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client we provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a full service integrated partner over several years 

large global partner  we believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service highquality provider of discovery and preclinical in vivo  products and services on a global scale many of our clients especially large biopharmaceutical companies have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work preferring to partner with tier 1 cros who offer and can bring experience in project management to a portfolio of capabilities large cros like charles river can present clients with access to greater value through economies of scale and scope this includes extensive scientific technical and therapeutic area expertise realtime access to data through secure portals a global footprint and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management we are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider by building and expanding broader and deeper longterm strategic relationships with our clients 

for example in 2012 we entered into a strategic relationship with a leading global pharmaceutical company for outsourced regulatory safety assessment and development dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics utilizing our capabilities will enable this client to create a flexible research platform to deliver innovative health solutions and in 2011 we expanded an existing preferred provider agreement with another leading global pharmaceutical company we are now this clients primary in vivo biology partner providing nonglp pharmacology for multiple therapeutic areas drug metabolism and dmpk services and glp safety assessmentwe believe we are at an inflection point when global biopharmaceutical companies are making the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery and development processes 

we believe it is critical to participate in that process now because the relationships that are formed now are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time from three to five years furthermore both the client and the cro invest heavily in the the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes given this investment clients are less likely to change cros which means that the opportunity to compete for the outsourced business may not be available again our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities so our strategy is focused on positioning charles river as the preferred partner for outsourced earlystage drug discovery and development products and services we differentiate ourselves by our broad earlystage portfolio which is unique in the cro universe our extensive scientific expertise our attention to client service our bestinclass data systems and portals and our ability to structure creative flexible solutions that support our clients goals of reducing the cost and improving the productivity of drug development 

  

we developed this strategy and focus in recognition of our clients needs biopharmaceutical companies continue to face increasing pressure to innovate and to better manage their pipelines accordingly our clients have reduced their infrastructure while simultaneously they have been searching for improved ways to identify and develop innovative new therapies clients are reducing historical fixed costs in favor of a more flexible business model with an aim to accelerate their discovery and development activities as a consequence our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients have been looking to outsource these services to high quality fullservice providers like us our business prospects are driven primarily by this trend towards the virtualization and externalization of our clients through partnering and outsourcing client spending is not just influenced by the levels of research and development at these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies but also by spending of all the sponsors including federal and state governments and other nonprofit organizations by providing clients with an outsourced suite of robust services from drug discovery to postind we allow them to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on 

areas that provide true differentiation and advance their pipelines this creates opportunities for us to help optimize our clients pipelines and be a true partner in accelerating their drug discovery and development process 

in recent years the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have faced a collection of challenges this involves scientific publicperception economic and regulatory challenges that all have negatively affected demand and pricing for outsourced discovery and preclinical development services these challenges included 

  

 

as a result there have been fundamental changes in our clients research and development needs particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process this has reduced the number of compounds moving into preclinical and clinical development and results in fewer molecules undergoing regulated safety assessment the result is a greater focus on discovery research services including in vivo  pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and nonregulated dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies second these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery research services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug research decision processes 

we believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future we remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to moving towards increased outsourcing of discovery services with the stabilization of factors addressed above as well as the successful launch of new therapies and the need to advance earlystage pipelines we believe outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be a positive driver 

we also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution they will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization we expect they will also continue to be conservative in rebuilding infrastructure and expertise this should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research and development efficiency and cost effectiveness 

to address the challenging market conditions that have persisted over the last few years we have taken significant steps to better support our clients identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiency and generally strengthen our business model our sales force is aligned to enhance our ability to support our clients and to focus on three particular client segments global biopharmaceutical companies midtier biopharmaceutical companies and academicgovernment institutions our pcs business is also aligned along functional lines to continue the process of standardizing and harmonizing our procedures this has enabled clients to place work with us at multiple locations with the knowledge that procedures are consistently performed and data delivered in standard formats we have begun the implementation of an erp system in order to improve availability of and access to data in october 2011 we took the next step to further integrate our businesses by unifying rms and pcs globally we did this to strengthen the linkage between the businesses which enables us to offer clients more seamless access to our broad portfolio and scientific expertise 

we also began to take decisive actions in 2009 to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency through a combination of lean six sigma process improvement initiatives and costsavings actions the cost savings actions were intended to rightsize our infrastructure and identify opportunities to operate more efficiently in 2011 we initiated a program to identify and implement additional operating efficiencies these actions were designed to streamline and optimize our operating processes and infrastructure to allow us to support our clients more efficiently and at a lower cost in 2012 we continued these efforts 

through the introduction of our profit improvement program to further optimize our global footprint by identifying top and bottomline drivers to improve efficiency and profitability 

in december 2010 we announced an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment we continued to make progress in 2012 on these key initiatives 



we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities in light of our actions and intensified focus as clients particularly larger pharmaceutical companies increase their outsourcing we believe that our expertise allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them we are able to build and maintain expertise and achieve economies of scale that are difficult for our clients to match within their internal infrastructures because these products and services are the core of our business 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the earlystage drug discovery and development continuum primarily through internal development and as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate on return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital 

this strategy may include geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services for example in october 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire 75 ownership of vital river the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in china for the last ten years vital river has been a licensee for production and distribution of our research models in china with sites which reflect our facility design the acquisition closed in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of this acquisition we now provide highquality research models and associated services to the emerging china market for drug discovery and development this strategy may also include strengthening the depth and expanding the breadth of our core capabilities and services in a related or adjacent business such as the accugenix acquisition 

customers 

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

   

our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies contract research organizations agricultural and chemical companies life science companies veterinary medicine companies contract manufacturing organizations medical device companies diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading 

hospitals academic institutions and government agencies   we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2012 no single commercial client accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales 

we continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients and with many of our larger midtier clients these relationships take different forms from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships these structured relationships incentivize clients to purchase more products and services across our earlystage portfolio and in total the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent approximately 25 of total company revenues this provides us better visibility than we have had in the past and because of the strength of these relationships better insight into our clients planning processes for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 12 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 12 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in in vivo  biology quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

 10 

   

we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 7200 employees including approximately 540 professionals with advanced scientific degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry we believe we have excellent relationships with our employees based on a number of factors including employee retention and employee surveys 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment from continuing operations was 2139 million at december 29 2012 as compared to 2025 million at december 31 2011 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders as backlog cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog we do not report backlog for our rms business segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2012 backlog may be completed in 2013 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs aaalac covers all species of laboratory animals including rats mice and birds our preclinical business is also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our facilities 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical safety assessment studies to support the registration or licensing of our clients products throughout the world a minor part of our rms business also conducts similar studies for our clients many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded reported and archived glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency ema medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada and other similar agencies in the countries we operate glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements to assure our compliance obligations we established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to ensure that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls comply with glp at each of our pcs sites qau provides testing facility management with reports that provide a written status on each study noting any problems and the corrective actions taken our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet regulatory and client expectations for quality and data integrity 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations we are subject to inspection on a routine basis by national fda and international monitoring authorities compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities we maintain a biological license with the fdas center for biologics evaluation and research that covers the manufacture and distribution of diagnostic reagents we also maintain an establishment license with the usdas center for veterinary biologics cvb for the manufacture of usda licensed antigens antibodies and viruses our avian business manufactures and markets three usda licensed products that are subject to regular inspection by the usda and cvb 

all of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all of our quality assurance functions 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our emd   testing business including accugenix and the endosafepts we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 nine of the ten members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to us or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics fully revised in 2012 which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the “investor relationscorporate governance” caption 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties   

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our growth 

over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development   decreases in preclinical outsourcing activity may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in the form 10k furthermore our client contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets    similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including funding for biotechnology companies which have suffered during the recent economic downturn also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the research and development spending by our pharmaceutical clients has been directed towards their laterstage products rather than earlystage studies as they reprioritize pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in the form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years including into 2012 and 2013 a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results    also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services the significance and timing of any reductions to the nihs budget from march 2013 may be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of 2011 and by whether these provisions remain in effect 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide  

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment 

procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation this legislation may significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in addition the us congress various state legislatures and european and asian governments may consider various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are presently uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

the fda is in the process of reviewing and updating the glp regulations to reflect current industry standards as this may change some of the glp requirements the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based 

on a finding of a material violation by us for good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us in recent years the fda has significantly increased the number of warning letters regarding drug products if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably there has been a recent updating and adoption of new guidance in europe european directive 201063eu that is being implemented over a period of several years on a countrybycountry basis   because of the complexities of the directive implementation process the transposition adoption and final enactment of the new regulations in each european union country will take three more years but they will be fully implemented by 2016    some of the new guidance will require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community who not only will bear the costs of these changes in the pricing of goods and services but will need to make similar changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance and import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants in the us guidance used by the nih and by certain oversight agencies for the care and use of laboratory animals was revised in 2010 and is currently being implemented furthermore we have begun implementation of some components of this new guidance in order to avoid additional costs in certain longterm contracts initiated or bid upon currently conforming to these new guidelines may cause us increased costs attributable to upgrading of existing or addition of new facilities the need to add personnel to address new processes as well as increased administrative burden 

our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

many of our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice in addition we sell our products and services to our competitors and similarly they sell products and services to us for instance we have historically entered into and currently are party to contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities 

clients andor competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 

if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases termination fees cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple 

contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results as of december 29 2012 the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles was 2935 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the us our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf of our total net sales in recent years we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

 17 

 negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings as well as shareholder proposals we received for our 2012 and 2013 annual meetings in some instances demonstrations at our operating sites occur at regular intervals any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large research models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system commercial disputes supplier insolvency or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other cros but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services we compete on a variety of factors including 

   

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other 

and for larger pharmaceutical companies although trends since 2008 also demonstrated increased merger activity between larger pharmaceutical companies themselves if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore between 2006 and 2008 both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area invested significantly in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing existing and sometimes excess capacity and market demand where capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects can occur more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us tax law 

in the us there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions exclusions and credits implementing a territorial regime of taxation limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and reducing the ability to defer us tax on offshore earnings these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from enhanced deductions and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or deductions due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies would likely have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and our effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a cro we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

   

we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of insurance coverage we also often contractually indemnify our clients similar to the way they indemnify us and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can be no assurance that we or a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test platforms in biomedical research as well as improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and viceversa some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies it is our strategy to explore nonanimal approaches to reduce the need for animal models as these new methods become validated we may not be successful in commercializing these methods and furthermore revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models in addition alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales lastly other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls that if not properly corrected could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could adversely affect our operating results and investor supplier and client confidence in our reported financial information 

as described in “item 9a controls and procedures” we have identified a material weakness in our system of internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2012 a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the material weakness was related to the design and operation of certain controls over information technology business processes and financial reporting specifically we identified deficiencies with respect to controls over segregation of duties 

restricted access changes to vendor and customer master data transaction level and financial close controls which aggregated to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

 in response to the identification of the material weakness management 1 has established a cross functional team to review and address segregation of duties conflicts and restricted access within the information technology used in our core business and 2 will design new controls or improve existing controls related to vendor and customer master data changes transaction level controls as well as financial close controls in addition we will evaluate staffing levels and responsibilities and increase training to reinforce preestablished and new controls to improve our ability to detect potential misstatements in our internally prepared reports analyses and financial records 

although there can be no assurances we believe these enhancements and improvements when repeated in future periods will remediate the control deficiencies described above if we are not able to remedy the control deficiencies in a timely manner we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information either of which could subject us to regulatory enforcement and other actions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations investor supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 29 2012 we had approximately 667 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 5 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past decade we have expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 21 

 in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for 36 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 22 

   

we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following managements discussion and analysis will help you understand our financial condition and results of operations the managements discussion and analysis is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies as well as government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology including laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of preclinical services  both glp good laboratory practice and nonglp  which address drug discovery and development utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increase speed to market we have been in business for over 65 years and currently operate approximately 65 facilities in 15 countries worldwide 

 large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been undergoing significant change for the last few years as they endeavor to improve the productivity of their drug development pipelines and at the same time streamline their infrastructures in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs our clients efforts have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of measured research and development spending by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies delays in customer decisions and commitments tight cost constraints and the resultant pricing pressure particularly in view of excess capacity in the contract research industry a focus on latestage clinical testing as customers accelerate their efforts to bring drugs to market in the face of expiration of patents on branded drugs decreased funding for biopharmaceutical companies and the impact of healthcare reform initiatives in addition consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has affected demand for our products and services all of these ongoing factors continue to contribute to demand uncertainty and are expected to impact future sales 

over the last two years our market for goods and services appears to have continued to stabilize as part of our clients efforts to improve pipeline productivity pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are emphasizing efficacy testing in order to eliminate molecules from the pipeline earlier in the drug development process this trend is visible in increasing demand for our nonglp in vivo  pharmacology and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics services we continue to anticipate that our clients will reduce their internal capacity through closure of underutilized facilities and increase their use of these outsourced services in the future because utilizing outsourced services enables them to create a flexible drug development model which improves operating efficiency and reduces costs 

as our clients increase focus on strategic outsourcing our scientific expertise operating efficiency informational technology platforms and ability to meet each clients individual needs strongly positions us to compete for business we continue to build momentum by formalizing the expansion of our strategic relationships with our clients last year we signed a large fiveyear agreement with a leading global pharmaceutical company to become the clients primary in vivo  biology partner during 2012 a large pharmaceutical company selected us as its preferred strategic partner for outsourced regulated safety assessment and development dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics for a threeyear period we won these strategic relationships in a highly competitive marketplace because of our broad portfolio of products and services scientific expertise and ability to develop a customized in vivo  biology program to support our clients drug development efforts price was a factor in the bid but we believe our scientific expertise was a key criterion our ongoing discussions concerning additional strategic relationships continue as our clients focus on the logistics of outsourcing additionally we continue to expand our relationships with our midtier and academic clients by focusing our sales and marketing efforts in order to achieve market share gains 

we believe that the longterm drivers for our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients continued demand for research models and services and both glp and nonglp in vivo  biology services which are essential to the drug development process however presently it is challenging to predict the timing associated with these drivers 

we continue to focus on our four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and to maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment these four initiatives are 

 also in 2012 we opened our new biomedical diagnostic testing facility in wilmington massachusetts the stateoftheart 60000squarefoot rd services facility expands our diagnostic capabilities for research model health monitoring clinical chemistry hematology biomarker assay development and immunoassay services in addition in 2012 we moved to a larger drs facility in finland to support our growth 

 total net sales in 2012  were 11295 million a decrease of 11  from 11426  million in 2011  the sales decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign currency translation which had a negative impact on sales of 20  due to the timing of our fiscal year end we periodically recognize a 53rd week in a fiscal year the 53 rd  week in 2011 negatively impacted our 2012 sales growth by 11 our gross margin decreased to 350  of net sales in 2012  compared to 352  of net sales in 2011  due primarily to the impact of lower sales and costs associated with the consolidation of certain rms europe operations 

our operating income was 1658 million for 2012  compared to operating income of 1743 million for 2011  income from continuing operations net of tax was 1021 million  for 2012  compared to 1155 million  for 2011  the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to a prior year life insurance gain and the prior year release of a valuation allowance on a tax loss related to the disposition of our phase i clinical business for 2012  diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareowners was 201  compared to a diluted loss per share of 214  in 2011  net income attributable to common shareowners was 973 million in 2012  compared to 1096 million in 2011  

we report two segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs which reflects the manner in which our operating units are managed 

our rms segment which represented 615  of net sales in 2012  includes three categories research models research model services and emd research models includes production of small and large research models as well as avian products research model services include four business units gems rads drs and insourcing solutions is net sales for the rms segment decreased 15  compared to 2011  primarily driven by the effect of foreign currency translation which had a negative impact on sales of 25  the rms gross margin and operating margin were essentially flat at 422  and 291  due mainly to the impact of cost savings offset by costs associated with the consolidation of certain rms europe operations 

our pcs segment which represented 385  of net sales in 2012  includes services required to take a drug through the development process including drs safety assessment and biopharmaceutical services sales for this segment decreased 06  from 2011  driven by unfavorable foreign currency which decreased sales growth by 11  partially offset by increased demand for preclinical services we experienced a decrease in the pcs gross margin to 236  from 240 in 2011  due mainly 

to impairments in 2011  and cost savings in 2012  partially offset by the impact of sales mix and continued pricing pressure the 2012  operating margin was 80  compared to 57 in 2011   mainly due to asset impairments in 2011  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

we consider the following accounting estimates important in understanding our operating results and financial condition for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  

valuation and impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles are not amortized and are reviewed for impairment at least annually valuation of goodwill requires significant judgment assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of longlived assets typically key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 

  we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it likely the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount to determine if impairment exists our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed in the fourth quarter 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  otherwise known as “step 0” step 0 provides entities with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the reporting units fair value is less than its goodwill the qualitative factors may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting units events affecting the reporting units share price etc 

as management considered whether applying purely qualitative assessment of goodwill would be sufficient ie applying step 0 without quantitative support and bypassing step 1 management reviewed the implied “cushion” for each reporting unit as of the prior years goodwill assessment for the pcs reporting unit given the relatively low cushion of approximately 15 and the preliminary 5year strategic plan management concluded that a quantitative analysis would be required therefore management decided to proceed to step 1 for all reporting units 

the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on our internal plans key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if 

the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process if required measures the goodwill impairment by calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to the manner in which goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including client relationships 

valuation and impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition should we determine that the carrying value of heldforuse longlived assets may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

longlived asset groups may be classified as heldforsale when the following conditions are met we have committed to a plan to sell the asset group and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan the asset group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and it is probable that the sale will be completed within one year and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and the asset group is being marketed at a sale price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value should we determine that the carrying value of heldforsale longlived assets exceeds its fair value we will measure any impairment based on this difference subsequent adjustments to the carrying amount of heldforsale assets based on changes in fair value are recorded but only to the extent of the carrying amount of the asset group when it entered the heldforsale category 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue related to our products which include research models emd technology and vaccine support products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally in the form of client purchase orders title and risk of loss have transferred which occurs upon delivery of the products the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured these recognition criteria are met at the time the product is delivered to the clients site product sales are recorded net of returns upon delivery for large models in some cases clients pay in advance of delivery of the product these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product 

our service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts our service revenue is recognized upon the completion of the agreed upon performance criteria these performance criteria are generally in the form of either study protocols or specified activities or procedures that we are engaged to perform these performance criteria are established by our clients and do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to the total estimated costs to complete procedures specified by clients in the form of study protocols in general such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules but are recognized as revenue as services are performed revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known 

deferred and unbilled revenue are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the client and recognized as unbilled receivable as of december 29 2012  based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts we recorded unbilled revenue of 325 million  and deferred revenue of 564 million  in our consolidated balance sheet 

service revenue from our businesses can be categorized as follows 

 pension plan accounting 

our defined benefit pension plans assets liabilities and expenses are calculated by accredited independent actuaries using certain assumptions which are approved by management the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisers and actuaries the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 29 2012  the weighted‑average discount rate for our pension plans was 413  as of december 29 2012  we had a pension liability of 444 million  

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the asset allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 24 million 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period during the year ended december 29 2012  we recognized 219 million  of stock compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock and performance based stock awards we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option‑pricing model and the fair value of 

our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straightline basis over the vesting periods of the awards net of estimated forfeitures forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility expected term expected dividends and riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated on at least an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 

we record deferred tax assets for stockbased awards based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of income at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction differences between the deferred tax assets and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paidin capital if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the long form method 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future we may need to increase or decrease income tax expense which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

as of december 29 2012  earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1551 million  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us federal and state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes which could be material it is our policy to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our nonus subsidiaries unless they can be repatriated in a manner that generates a tax benefit or an unforeseen cash need arises in the united states and the earnings can be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax free determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable due to the complexities with the hypothetical calculation additionally the amount of the liability is dependent upon the circumstances existing if and when the remittance occurs 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our current and deferred tax provision is based upon enacted tax rates in effect for the current and future periods any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws and regulations or changes to interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured based upon the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments resolutions of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



segment operations 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 





fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011

liquidity and capital resources 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations and proceeds from our longterm debt and revolving credit arrangements 

our credit agreement dated september 23 2011 provides for a 2998 million term loan a €694 million euro term loan and a 350 million revolving credit facility under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loans andor revolving line of credit by up to 250 million in the aggregate the term loan facility matures in 20 quarterly installments with the last installment due september 23 2016 the 350 million revolving facility also matures on september 23 2016 and requires no scheduled payment before that date the book value of our term and revolving loans approximates fair value we also had 50 million  outstanding under letters of credit as of december 29 2012

in october 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire a 75  majority ownership interest of vital river a commercial provider of research models and related services in china for approximately 268 million  in cash subject to certain closing adjustments the acquisition closed in january 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities for the years ending december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  was 2080 million  and 2068 million  respectively the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to taxes payable deferred revenue and accrued compensation partially offset by net income and trade receivables our days sales outstanding dso increased to 51  days as of december 29 2012  compared to 48  days as of december 31 2011  our dso includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation the increase in our dso was primarily driven by slower collections and decreased deferred revenue our net cash provided by operating activities will be impacted by future timing of client payments for products and services as evidenced in our dso a oneday increase or decrease in our dso represents a 

change of approximately 31 million of cash provided by operating activities our allowance for doubtful accounts was 43 million as of december 29 2012  compared to 40 million  as of december 31 2011

the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the conversion features of our 2013 notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements because the conversion features associated with these notes are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity these instruments are not accounted for as derivatives 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income the fasb decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity the update also requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in the twostatement approach the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income this amendment became effective for us on january 1 2012 and was applied retrospectively 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update related to the goodwill impairment test the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing companies with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether future impairment testing is necessary the revised standard was effective for us on january 1 2012 and was applied prospectively 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update related to comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the revised standard requires companies to present 

information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their annual financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements this amendment will become effective for us on january 1 2013 and will be applied retrospectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we entered into our amended credit agreement on september 23 2011 our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility in the credit agreement 

our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 64 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

we issued 3500 million of the 2013 notes in a private placement in the second quarter of 2006 the 2013 notes bear an interest rate of 225 the fair market value of the outstanding notes was approximately 3517 million  on december 29 2012 based on their quoted market value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of the revenue from our foreign operations is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies additionally we have exposure on certain intercompany loans we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges 

during 2012 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on client transactions and certain balance sheet items including intercompany loans the foreign currency contract outstanding as of december 29 2012 is a nondesignated hedge and is marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 




 item 9 changes in and disagreement with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

based on their evaluation required by paragraph b of rules 13a15 or 15d15 promulgated by the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act are not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of december 29 2012 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures based upon their evaluation our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness below relating to our internal control over financial reporting 

a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls 

as of december 29 2012 management determined that the company did not maintain effective controls over information technology business processes and financial reporting specifically the company identified deficiencies with respect to design and operation of controls over segregation of duties restricted access changes to vendor and customer master data transaction level and financial close controls which aggregated to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

we have determined that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 

based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting we believe the consolidated financial statement included in this report as of and for the periods ended december 29 2012 are fairly stated in all material respects 

we continually are in the process of further reviewing and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and accordingly may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business 

 there were no changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of the exchange act rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during the quarter ended december 29 2012 that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting 

subsequent remediation efforts 

the following remediation efforts as outlined below are designed to address the aforementioned material weakness identified by management and to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting 

in response to the identification of the material weakness in the first quarter of 2013 management performed additional procedures designed to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting and based upon such performance we believe the consolidated financial statement included in this report as of and for the periods ended december 29 2012 are fairly stated

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the earlystage drug discovery and development process the focus of our business is in vivo  biology our portfolio includes research models and services required to enable in vivo  drug discovery and development 

discovery  represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development  activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability  and clinical efficacy  of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro  typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo  in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money various studies and reports estimate it takes between 1016 years up to 20 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug we are positioned to leverage our core competency in in vivo  biology in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in earlystage drug discovery and development 

we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies for 65 years over this time we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate approximately 64 facilities in 15 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our clients to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2011 our net sales from continuing operations were 11 billion and our operating income from continuing operations was 1743 million 

we have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs 

through our rms segment we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with over 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including barrier rooms andor isolator facilities strategically located near our clients in 2011 rms accounted for 617 of our total net sales from continuing operations and approximately 51 of our employees including approximately 100 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

services provided by our pcs business segment enables our clients to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired safety assessment and related drug development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of larger global pharmaceutical companies the basis for global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choosing to outsource their development activities is traced to the significant investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently and effectively conduct these activities outsourcing allows them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and particularly for pharmaceutical companies promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical including both discovery and development services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of safety assessment studies especially those dealing with large molecule biologics and other innovative therapies we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada and europe our pcs segment represented 383 of our total net sales from continuing operations in 2011 and employed 45 of our employees including approximately 295 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

we provide nonregulated or nonglp discovery services in both the rms and pcs business segments as they have continued to reduce infrastructure and search for more efficient and cost effective models of drug discovery and development large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are choosing to outsource more discovery services which they historically considered core competencies these services which are generally nonregulated are used by sponsors to screen molecules and make earlier “gono go” decisions as to which molecules should be selected for continued investment 

over the past three years we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations these actions were intended to enhance our ability to support our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients who are increasingly seeking full service global partners to whom they can outsource more of their earlystage drug research and development efforts by some estimates the outsourced in vivo  discovery and drug development services markets in which we currently participate ranging from research model production to nonregulated discovery services to regulated safety assessment has a current size of approximately 60 billion and in the aggregate is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue it is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is approximately 40 outsourced while emerging growth areas such as in vivo  discovery and certain research model services are believed to be less outsourced currently 

research models and services rms   our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 other related products and services 

research models   a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions we have 20 production facilities located in 7 countries worldwide which are strategically located to be in close proximity to our clients our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality associated with the products our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

 we also offer proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research oncology central nervous system metabolic cardiovascular and renal diseases 

in addition to our small research models we also are a premier provider of high quality purpose bred specificpathogenfree spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

research model services  rms also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients use of research models in screening drug candidates these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research 

models as well as services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the clients drug evaluation process we currently offer four major categories of research models servicesgenetically engineered models and services insourcing solutions fka consulting and staffing services discovery services and research animal diagnostic services 

genetically engineered models and services gems   in this area of our business we assist our clients in breeding and maintenance of research models purchased or purposefully created by our clients for biomedical research activities while the creation of a genetically engineered model gem can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support early discovery research we provide breeding expertise and colony development quarantine health monitoring germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation including assisted reproduction and genetic monitoring we provide these services to clients around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities 

insourcing solutions   building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage research model care operations including recruitment training staffing and management services on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial clients demand for our services has been driven by the trend for research institutions to choose to retain certain elements of their research efforts inhouse but prefer to outsource staffing and management of those elements in addition we believe that our expertise in in vivo  biology and in particular research model care facility operations and discovery and development services enhances the productivity and quality of our clients research model programs 

discovery services   augmenting our traditional model production and gems we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of discovery research development and imaging areas expediting the development process of investigational agents by providing products and services to clients extends their internal capabilities complements their internal expertise and helps reduce product development timelines in addition our in vivo  biology expertise positions us to provide complementary disease model services which include surgical procedures preconditioning and aging our discovery and research and development capabilities include facilities in north carolina focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies in oncology inflammation and metabolic disease and finland focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies for the evaluation of investigational agents for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system in addition we offer therapeutic efficacy expertise in inflammation metabolic cardiovascular and oncologic pharmacology 

research animal diagnostic services   we assist our clients in monitoring and analyzing the health profiles of the research models and cell lines used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a clients needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued use characterization and utilization of specific disease models and gems allows us to be well positioned to be the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of animal diagnostics 

other related research model products and services   we also offer two other categories of products and services within rms in vitro  products and avian vaccine services 

in vitro   our in vitro  business provides nonanimal or in vitro  methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and most successful fdavalidated in vitro  alternative to an animal model test to date the extraction of blood does not harm the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our in vitro  business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services which are used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured 

our growth in the in vitro  business is driven by our fda approved line of next generation endotoxin testing products which are based on the endosafe portable testing system endosafe ® pts™ technology that allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment in recent years we have expanded the pts product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the endosafemcs multi cartridge system in response to the demand of our higher testing volume clients we anticipate continued adoption of rapid methods as our clients respond to the fdas process analytical technology pat initiative in addition we are planning to introduce a fully automated mcs in 2012 which will assist in penetrating our clients highvolume central testing laboratories we also expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in nontraditional areas such as renal dialysis nuclear and compounding pharmacies and cellular therapy we are currently exploring obtaining 510k medical device approval of this technology for clinical diagnostic 

applications 

avian vaccine services   we are the global leader   for the supply of specificpathogenfree or spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is performed under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence with several spf egg production facilities in the united states contracted production capabilities in hungary and franchise operations in china and india we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

preclinical services pcs     

we currently offer the following preclinical services in which we include both in vivo  and in vitro  studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development 

discovery support at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the pharmacology of drug candidates in several important therapeutic areas including 

 we also offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business are complementary to the discovery services that we offer through our rms business 

safety assessment we offer a full range of preclinical studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism   in support of preclinical drug safety testing our clients are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis for preclinical study support we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied to higher doses that may result in adverse effects our clients require these studies for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug the results of which are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

toxicology   toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected appropriate toxicology studies are conducted in support of clinical trials in humans these toxicology studies are typically performed in laboratory models to elucidate the potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods and focus on safety and assessment of harmful effects our toxicology services feature

health products and other materials 

 our preclinical facilities operate in compliance with good laboratory practices glps to the extent required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities our clients quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program 

pathology services   in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety of potential new therapeutics we employ a large number of highly trained veterinary pathologists and other scientists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical not only for regulatory safety assessment studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key “gonogo” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients 

biopharmaceutical services   we provide specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our laboratories in the united states germany scotland and ireland provide timely compliant molecular biology virology bioanalytical immunochemistry microbiology and related services we confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this testing is required by the fda and other global regulatory authorities for our clients to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we also collaborate with clients on process development validation and manufacturing scaleup 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients we aim to provide flexible tailored solutions to help them accelerate and enhance the efficiency of their drug research and development efforts and thereby drive our growth our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of earlystage products and services which supports our clients goal to maintain the flexible infrastructure they need in order to bring new therapies to market faster and more cost effectively we believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy as a result of our continuing focus on the following 

 6 

 

 

 

 

this strategy and focus has been developed in recognition of the needs of our clients who are increasingly facing pressure to manage their research and development costs while at the same time maintain or develop a strong pipeline of innovative new drugs conduct research and development in multiple countries simultaneously and identify hire and retain a breadth of scientific and technical experts in order to convert what has historically been largely fixed costs into variable expenses and to facilitate and speed their research our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are making strategic decisions to outsource a portfolio of services to high quality fullservice providers like us our business prospects are driven primarily by this trend towards the virtualization of our clients through outsourcing as well as by the level of research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the federal government and academic institutions outsourcing allows our clients to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on early drug discovery in areas such as lead identification and optimization and for more mature companies postapproval marketing while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours who can help optimize our clients programs and assist in accelerating their drug discovery and development process 

in recent years the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have faced challenges that negatively affected demand and pricing for outsourced preclinical development services these challenges included 

 

 

 

 

 

 7 

 

the result has been a fundamental change in our clients research and development models particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry first these clients are increasingly emphasizing shorter term nonregulated efficacy studies designed to eliminate nonviable molecules earlier in the development process this results in a more limited number of molecules undergoing regulated safety assessment and a greater focus on discovery services including nonregulated testing such as dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and in vivo  pharmacology second these clients are choosing to outsource more discovery services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug research processes 

we believe that these changes will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us going forward in fact we remain optimistic that their receptiveness towards increased discovery services outsourcing and the stabilization of other factors addressed above including the successful launch of new therapies currently in latestage development and the subsequent need to replenish earlystage pipelines will eventually drive the pharmaceutical industry to refocus on their earlystage development efforts also we believe that as larger pharmaceutical companies become leaner and more efficient generally focusing on their core competencies of fundamental research and development and commercialization they will also continue to be conservative in their staffing and further reduce their inhouse expertise this should lead to a reinvigoration of outsourcing as they choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large pharmaceutical research and development model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allows them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their rd efficiency and cost effectiveness 

to address the challenging market conditions which have persisted over the last few years we have taken significant steps to better support our clients identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiency and generally strengthen our business model in 2009 we realigned our sales force in order to enhance our ability to support our clients and to focus on three particular client segments global biopharmaceutical companies midtier biopharmaceutical companies and academicgovernment institutions also in 2009 we realigned our pcs business along functional lines in order to continue the process of standardizing and harmonizing our procedures which has enabled clients to place work with us at multiple locations with the knowledge that procedures are consistently performed and data delivered in standard formats in 2010 we began the implementation of an erp system in order to improve availability of and access to data in october 2011 we took the next step to further integrate our businesses by unifying rms and pcs globally we took this action to strengthen the linkage between the businesses which enables us to offer clients more seamless access to our broad portfolio and scientific expertise 

we also began to take decisive actions in 2009 to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency through a combination of lean six sigma initiatives and costsavings actions these actions were intended to rightsize our infrastructure and to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently in 2011 in addition to our six sigma initiative we undertook a project to identify and implement additional operating efficiencies these actions were designed to streamline our operating infrastructure reduce process cycle times and eliminate nonvalue added steps so that we could support our clients more efficiently and at a lower cost 

in december 2010 we announced an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment we made significant progress in 2011 on these key initiatives 



in light of our actions and intensified focus we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities as strategic outsourcing by our clients increases and in particular by larger biopharmaceutical clients we believe that our expertise in areas previously addressed by our clients inhouse capabilities allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them in short because these products and services are the core of our business we are able to build and maintain expertise and achieve economies of scale that are difficult for our clients to match within their internal infrastructures 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the earlystage drug development continuum primarily through internal development which will be augmented as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate on return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital this strategy may include geographic expansion of existing core services strengthening our core services or technical capabilities or the addition of a new product or service in a related or adjacent business in 2011 we identified and evaluated a number of acquisition opportunities but none that met our criteria closed during the year 

customers 

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

 our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies contract research organizations cros agricultural and chemical companies life science veterinary medicine contract manufacturing organizations cmos medical device diagnostic and other commercial entities as well as leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our clients during 2011 no single commercial client accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales

sales marketing and customer support 

we have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments enhancing our ability to meet client needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients will benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams the majority of whom work in north america with the balance in europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sales force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters webinars and making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain locales our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents for our products and services particularly with respect to our in vitro  and biopharmaceutical services businesses 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with clients in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our clients routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients 

our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of in vivo  biology are increasingly attractive to our clients and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition 

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in in vivo  biology quality reputation flexibility responsiveness pricing innovation and global capabilities we are able to offer a unique portfolio of earlystage products and services to support drug discovery and development 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

 we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 7100 employees including approximately 400 professionals with advanced scientific degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states   although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our past employee surveys have indicated that we have excellent relationships with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment from continuing operations was 2025 million at december 31 2011 as compared to 2199 million at december 25 2010 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a clients intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders as backlog cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog we do not report backlog for our rms business segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2011 backlog may be completed in 2012 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our us small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs aaalac covers all species of laboratory animals including rats mice and birds our preclinical 

business is also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions as well as a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical safety assessment studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients products throughout the world a minor part of our rms business also conducts similar studies for our clients the conduct of many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency ema medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada and the japanese ministry of health and welfare among others glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations we are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities we also maintain a biological license agreement bla with the fdas center for biologics evaluation and research cber that covers the manufacture and distribution of in vitro  diagnostic reagents in detecting endotoxins we also maintain an establishment license with usdas center for veterinary biologics cvb that covers certain of our sites which manufacture usda licensed antigens antibodies and viruses that are sold to clients for use in the manufacturing of their own usda licensed products our vaccine support business also manufactures and markets three usda licensed products that are considered final use products mycoplasma gallisepticum antigen mycoplasma melegridis antigen and mycoplasma synoviae antigen and sites involved in the manufacture of these articles are subject to regular inspection by usdacvb 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we have established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all of our quality assurance functions 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and through registrations in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services businesses in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhancing our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area 

expertise with the exception of technology related to our in vitro  testing business including the endosafepts we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of the products or services we offer are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 nine of the ten members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to the company or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the “investor relationscorporate governance” caption 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

set forth below elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past decade our businesses have grown as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical research support activities while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development decreases in preclinical outsourcing activity may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in fact in 2011 our revenues for our pcs segment declined 63 from 2010 our 2010 pcs revenues declined 88 from 2009 and 2009 revenues declined 195 from 2008 for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled “our strategy” included elsewhere in the form 10k furthermore our client contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and 

services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including funding for biotechnology companies which have suffered during the recent economic downturn also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the research and development spending by our pharmaceutical clients has been directed towards their laterstage products rather than earlystage studies as they reprioritize pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients please see the sections entitled “our strategy” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in the form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies which can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the us government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years including into 2012 a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results    also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the us strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the us congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures in november 2011 the us supreme court decided to review the constitutionality of this legislation and agreed to hear oral arguments in march 2012 if this legislation or parts of it is found to be constitutional the legislation as enacted and implemented may significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in addition the us congress various state legislatures and european and asian governments may consider various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are presently uncertain as to the effects of the recently enacted legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit 

the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the us and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us in recent years the fda has significantly increased the number of warning letters regarding drug products typically such letters and the underlying accountability are directed to the drug sponsor but in recent years the fda has provided such letters to a small number of other contract research organizations cro if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably there has been a recent updating and adoption of new guidance in europe that will be implemented over a period of several years on a countrybycountry basis   because of the complexities of the formal adoption process the finalization and implementation of this guidance will likely take three or more years but is likely to be fully implemented by 2016 some of the new guidance will require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors but clients in the biomedical research community who not only will bear the costs of these changes in the pricing of goods and services but will also need to make similar changes in their own operations 

similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation euthanasia guidance and import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants in the us guidance used by the nih and by certain oversight agencies for the care and use of laboratory animals was revised in 2010 and will be implemented over a three year period which began in 2011 furthermore we have had to begin implementation of some components of this new guidance in 2011 in order to avoid additional costs in certain longterm contracts initiated or bid upon in 2011 conforming to these new guidelines will likely cause us increased costs attributable to upgrading of existing or addition of new facilities the need to add personnel to address new processes as well as increased administrative burden 

our standard client agreements contain customer‑determined termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our clients provide that the clients can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice clients may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

 if a client terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple 

contracts could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under‑price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the client the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our clients facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models while often we own these models they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider accordingly risk of contamination may be outside of our control and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contaminationfree environment furthermore while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure including aging fatigue such failures are unpredictable and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events failures andor contaminations may still occur 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it likely the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting 

units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a market based approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including client relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2011 the fair value of our business units exceed their carrying value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 

goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 31 2011 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 2910 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the us our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf of our total net sales in recent years we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

 17 

convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions 

 negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention including shareholder proposals impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us as well as a shareholder proposal we received for our 2012 annual meeting any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large research models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other contract research organizations cro but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for our services we compete on a variety of factors including 

 18 

 if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies although recent trends since 2008 also demonstrated increased merger activity between larger pharmaceutical companies themselves if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore between 2006 and 2008 both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area invested significantly in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing existing and sometimes excess capacity and market demand where capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects can occur more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies services or products and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us tax law 

in its budget submission to congress in february 2010 and reiterated in the administrations 2012 and 2013 budget proposals the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies the proposed changes include among others limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense allocated and apportioned to offshore earnings and modifying the foreign tax credit rules additionally on october 26 2011 house ways and means committee chairman camp released a draft tax reform proposal that includes a reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate a move to a territorial tax system which allows a partial exemption from taxation for dividends received from foreign corporations and gains recognized on the sale of shares in foreign corporations as well as certain antibase erosion and thin capitalization rules while it is uncertain how the us congress may address the issue of tax reform it continues to be a topic of discussion and debate although the scope of the proposed changes remains unclear and the likelihood of enactment is uncertain it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from enhanced deductions and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the uk any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or deductions due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies would likely have a material adverse effect on our profits cash flow and our effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

 19 

while in our possession 

 we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections 

in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we or a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services   

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging technology could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method or other method that reduces the need for animal research models as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets    however we generally may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales in addition other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by our clients 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in 2010 we completed the initial implementation of a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the first stages which included all of our us sites as well as our rms site in canada and our pcs sites in montreal and edinburgh went live in 2010 we are now enhancing the value of the systems reporting capabilities the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 739 million   of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 5 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer   

during the past decade we have expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

 21 

 in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

 we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems   

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for 35 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our noneuropean based senior management if mr foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have a strong record of employee retention there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

 22 

 we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

we continually evaluate capacity in light of our client needs and demands accordingly in 2011 we disposed of our pcs operation in shanghai china and consolidated our discovery services site in michigan with our operations in north carolina currently we do not anticipate significant expansion requirements in our pcs business for the next few years due to available capacity at existing and suspended sites however we may expand at specific sites should we determine that it is not feasible to utilize available capacity at existing or suspended sites we have adequate capacity to meet the current needs of our rms clients and do not currently envision the need for significant expansion of our rms capacity 

we continue to employ a master site planning strategy to proactively evaluate our real estate needs in certain circumstances we dispose of or consolidate operations where the associated real estate is leased depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not party to any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition on january 31 2012 a putative class action entitled irma garcia v charles river laboratories inc was filed against us in the san diego superior court alleging various causes of action related to failure to make proper and timely payments to employees in california failure to timely furnish accurate itemized wage statements unfair business practices associated penalties pursuant to california law and declaratory relief while no prediction may be made as to the outcome of litigation we intend to defend against this proceeding vigorously

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following managements discussion and analysis will help you understand the financial condition and results of operations the managements discussion and analysis is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies as well as government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently we have built upon our core competency of in vivo  biology including laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse portfolio of preclinical services  both glp good laboratory practice and nonglp  which address drug discovery and development utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model which reduces their costs enhances their productivity and effectiveness and increases speed to market we have been in business for 65 years and currently operate approximately 64 facilities in 15 countries worldwide 

large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been undergoing significant changes over the last few years as they endeavor to improve the productivity of their drug development pipelines and at the same time streamline their infrastructures in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs our clients efforts have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of measured research and development spending by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies delays in client decisions and commitments tight cost constraints and the resultant pricing pressure particularly in view of excess capacity in the contract research industry a focus on latestage clinical testing as clients accelerate their efforts to bring drugs to market in the face of expiration of patents on branded drugs decreased funding for biopharmaceutical companies and the impact of healthcare reform initiatives in addition consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has also affected demand for our products and services all of these ongoing factors continue to contribute to demand uncertainty 

the market for our goods and services appears to be stabilizing but we remain uncertain as to when the unfavorable market factors will abate as part of clients efforts to improve pipeline productivity pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are emphasizing efficacy testing in order to eliminate therapies from the pipeline earlier in the drug development process this trend is visible in increasing demand for our nonglp in vivo  pharmacology and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics dmpk services we continue to anticipate that our clients will reduce their internal capacity through closure of underutilized facilities and increase their use of these outsourced services in the future because utilizing outsourced services enables them to create a flexible drug development model which improves operating efficiency and reduces costs we believe that increased focus on strategic outsourcing by our clients should result in the expansion of strategic relationships with a reduced and limited number of partners which will drive demand for our services we believe that the longterm drivers for our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients continued demand for research models and services and both glp and nonglp in vivo  biology services which are essential to the drug development process however presently it is challenging to predict the timing associated with these drivers 

we continue to focus on our four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and to maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment these four initiatives are 

 29 

 total net sales in 2011 were 11426 million an increase of 08 from 11334 million in 2010 the sales increase was due primarily to increased sales for rms partially offset by lower pcs sales the effect of foreign currency translation had a positive impact on sales of 22 due to the timing of our fiscal year end we periodically recognize a 53rd week in a fiscal year the 53 rd  week in 2011 contributed approximately 10 to reported 2011 sales 

our gross margin increased to 352 of net sales in 2011 compared to 339 of net sales in 2010 due primarily to cost savings actions and the impact of increased rms sales 

our operating income was 1743 million for 2011 compared to an operating loss of 2985 million for 2010 income from continuing operations net of tax was 1155 million for 2011 compared to an operating loss of 3341 million for 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily due to prior year items which include a goodwill impairment asset impairments and the 300 million acquisition termination fee for 2011 diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareowners was 214 compared to a diluted loss per share of 538 in 2010 our capital expenditures totaled 491 million for 2011 compared to 429 million for 2010 our planned capital expenditures in 2012 are approximately 500 million net income attributable to common shareowners was 1096 million in 2011 compared to a net loss of 3367 million in 2010 

we report two segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs which reflects the manner in which our operating units are managed 

our rms segment which represented 617 of net sales in 2011 includes three categories production of research models research model services and other products research model services include four business units genetically engineered models and services gems research animal diagnostics rads discovery services ds and insourcing solutions is other products includes our in vitro  business and avian vaccine services net sales for the rms segment increased 58 compared to 2010 primarily driven by higher sales of other products and research model services the effect of foreign currency translation has a positive impact on sales of 27 we experienced increases in both the rms gross margin to 421 from 417 and operating margin to 292 from 277 last year due mainly to the impact of cost savings and our fixed cost leverage with increased sales 

our pcs segment which represented 383 of net sales in 2011 includes services required to take a drug through the development process including discovery support safety assessment and biopharmaceutical services sales for this segment decreased 63 from 2010 driven by slower demand for preclinical services partially offset by favorable foreign currency which increased sales growth by 15 we experienced an increase in the pcs gross margin to 240 from 228 in 2010 due mainly to impairments in 2010 and cost savings in 2011 partially offset by the impact of sales mix and continued pricing pressure the 2011 operating margin was 57 compared to 814 in 2010 mainly due to the goodwill impairment and asset impairments in 2010 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

we consider the following accounting estimates important in understanding our operating results and financial condition for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1 significant accounting 

policies  

valuation and impairment of goodwill other intangible assets and other longlived assets 

valuation of certain longlived assets including property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of longlived assets typically key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 

we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it likely the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on our internal plans key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process is to determine the impairment which involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to the manner in which goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including client relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2011 the fair value of our businesses units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired 

additionally we performed an annual assessment of the fair value of our inprocess research and development acquired in the acquisition of spc the fair value of the inprocess research and development was less than the carrying value recorded as the time of the acquisition based on the evaluation we recorded an impairment in 2011 of 68 million 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 31 2011 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 2910 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

for intangible assets goodwill and property plant and equipment we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider 

important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 should we determine that the carrying value of longlived tangible assets may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue related to our products which include research models in vitro technology and vaccine support products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally in the form of client purchase orders title and risk of loss have transferred which occurs upon delivery of the products the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured these recognition criteria are met at the time the product is delivered to the clients site product sales are recorded net of returns upon delivery for large models in some cases clients pay in advance of delivery of the product these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product 

our service revenue is comprised of discovery support safety assessment  rads gems ds and is and is generally evidenced by client contracts safety assessment services provide highly specialized toxicology studies to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new pharmaceutical molecules and materials used in medical devices it also includes pathology services which provide the ability to identify and characterize pathologic changes within tissues and cells in determining the safety of a new compound rads services monitor and analyze the health and genetics of research models used in research protocols gems services include validating maintaining breeding and testing research models for biomedical research activities ds augments our gems services by providing efficacy studies and other services required as drugs progress through the development pipeline is provides management of animal care operations on behalf of government academic pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations 

the safety assessment services arrangements typically range from one to six months but can range up to approximately 24 months in length these agreements are negotiated for a fixed fee laboratory service arrangements are generally completed within a onemonth period and are also of a fixed fee nature ds services are also shortterm in nature while gems and is are longerterm from six months to five years and are billed at agreed upon rates as specified in the contract 

our service revenue is recognized upon the completion of the agreed upon performance criteria these performance criteria are generally in the form of either study protocols or specified activities or procedures which we are engaged to perform these performance criteria are established by our clients and do not contain acceptance provisions which are based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to estimated costs to complete procedures specified by clients in the form of study protocols in general such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules but are recognized as revenue as services are performed as a result of the reviews revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known 

deferred and unbilled revenue are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the client and recognized as unbilled receivable as of december 31 2011 based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts we recorded unbilled revenue of 294 million and deferred revenue of 565 million in our consolidated balance sheet 

pension plan accounting 

our defined benefit pension plans assets liabilities and expenses are calculated by accredited independent actuaries using certain assumptions which are approved by management the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisers and actuaries the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 31 2011 the weighted‑average discount rate for our pension plans was 447 as of december 31 2011 we had a pension liability of 492 million 

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the asset allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 20 million 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized 217 million of stock compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock and performance based stock awards we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option‑pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straightline basis over the vesting periods of the awards net of estimated forfeitures forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility expected term expected dividends and riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated on at least an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 

we record deferred tax assets for stockbased awards based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of income at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction differences between the deferred tax assets and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paidin capital if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense our pool of excess tax benefits in computed in accordance with the long form method 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future we may need to increase or decrease income tax expense which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2011 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1065 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us federal and state taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is our policy to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our nonus subsidiaries unless they can be repatriated in a manner that generates a tax benefit or an unforeseen cash need arises in the united states and the earnings can be repatriated in a manner that is substantially free of income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our current and deferred tax provision is based upon enacted tax rates in effect for the current and future periods any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws and regulations or changes to interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured based upon the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments resolutions of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



segment operations 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 





in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

net sales   net sales for the year ending december 31 2011 were 11426 million an increase of 92 million or 08 from 1133 million for the year ending december 25 2010 due primarily to increased sales for rms and favorable foreign currency translation of 22 partially offset by lower pcs sales 

research models and services   for the year ending december 31 2011 net sales for our rms segment were 7054 million an increase of 384 million  or 58  from 6670 million for the year ending december 25 2010 due primarily to higher other product sales which include our avian and in vitro businesses as well as research model services the effect of favorable foreign currency translation increased sales by 27 

preclinical services   for the year ending december 31 2011 net sales for our pcs segment were 4372 million a decrease of 292 million or 63 from 4664 million for the year ending december 25 2010 the sales decrease was driven by reduced biopharmaceutical spending which resulted in lower demand for our services and a shift in study mix offset by favorable foreign currency translation of 15

in order to enable us to facilitate on a more timely and cost efficient basis the repurchase of a substantial number of our shares pursuant to our 7500 million stock repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in 2010 we entered into agreements with a third party investment bank to implement an accelerated stock repurchase asr program the asr programs are recorded as two transactions allocated between the initial purchase of treasury stock and a forward contract indexed to our common stock the treasury shares result in an immediate reduction of shares on our statement of financial position and in our eps calculation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we entered into our amended credit agreement on september 23 2011 our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility in the credit agreement 

our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 71 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

we issued 3500 million of the 2013 notes in a private placement in the second quarter of 2006 the 2013 notes bear an interest rate of 225 the fair market value of the outstanding notes was approximately 3395 million on december 31 2011 based on their quoted market value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of the revenue from our foreign operations is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies additionally we have exposure on certain intercompany loans we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges 

during 2011 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on client 

transactions and certain balance sheet items including intercompany loans the foreign currency contract outstanding as of december 31 2011 is a nondesignated hedge and is marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services the drug development process requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money—various studies and reports estimate it takes between 1016 years up to 20 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug charles river is positioned to leverage our core competency in in vivo biology in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our customers in bringing their drugs to market faster 

we have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs we provide the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for over 60 years we have built upon our core competency to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development our customer base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate approximately 68 facilities in 16 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2010 our net sales from continuing operations were 113 billion and our operating loss from continuing operations was 2985 million 

since 2004 we have acquired companies that have broadened our portfolio of highend services to include general toxicology specialty toxicology discovery and imaging services and biopharmaceutical services in addition these acquisitions significantly expanded our overall corporate size and expanded and strengthened our global footprint in the growing market for pharmaceutical research and development services 

these acquisitions which include piedmont research center llc cerebricon ltd and systems pathology company llc in 2009 and newlab bioquality ag in 2008 have been critical in our continuing mission to support our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers who are increasingly seeking full service global partners to whom they can outsource more of their preclinical research and development efforts by some estimates the outsourced in vivo discovery and drug development services markets in which we currently participate—ranging from research model production through discovery services through preclinical services—has a current size of approximately 5060 billion and it is thought that this represents approximately 40 of all of the related in vivo 

discovery and nonclinical drug development work currently performed with wide variances among the different services ranging from 15 to 100 outsourced and in the aggregate is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue 

research models and services rms charles river has been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with approximately 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and microbiologically defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia we maintain production centers including a total of approximately 185 barrier rooms or isolator facilities strategically located near our customers in 2010 rms accounted for 588 of our total net sales from continuing operations and approximately 475 of our employees including approximately 116 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 other related products and services 

research models a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions we have 20 production facilities located in 7 countries worldwide which are strategically located to be in close proximity to our customers our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality associated with the products our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

• outbred which are genetically heterogeneous • inbred which are genetically identical • hybrid which are the offspring of two different inbred parents • spontaneous mutant which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and • other genetically modified research models including knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic animals we also offer proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research oncology central nervous system metabolic cardiovascular and renal diseases 

in addition to our small research models we also are a premier provider of highquality purposebred specific pathogenfree spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

research model services rms also offers a variety of services described below designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models as well as services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the customers drug evaluation process we currently offer four major categories of research models services—genetically engineered models and services consulting and staffing services discovery services and research animal diagnostic services 

genetically engineered models and services gems in this area of our business we assist our customers in breeding and maintenance of research models purchased or purposefully created by our customers for biomedical research activities while the creation of a genetically engineered model gem can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise we provide breeding expertise and colony development quarantine and health monitoring germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation including assisted reproduction and genetic monitoring we provide these services to over 500 laboratories and customers around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities 

consulting and staffing services building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage research model care operations including recruitment training staffing and management services on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers demand for our services has been driven by the trend for research institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to their core scientific innovation process or for which they do not maintain the necessary resources inhouse in addition we believe that our expertise in research model care and facility operations enhances the productivity and quality of our customers research model programs 

discovery services augmenting our traditional model production and gems described above we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our customers in a variety of discovery research development and imaging areas expediting the development process of investigational agents by providing products and services to customers extends their internal capabilities complements their internal expertise and helps reduce product development timelines in addition our in vivo biology expertise positions us to provide complementary disease model services which include surgical procedures preconditioning and aging we augmented our discovery and research and development capabilities substantially in 2009 via the acquisitions of piedmont research center focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies in oncology and other therapeutic areas and cerebricon ltd focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies for the evaluation of investigational agents for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system in addition we offer therapeutic efficacy expertise in inflammation metabolic cardiovascular and oncologic pharmacology the discovery services that we offer through our rms business are complementary to the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business 

research animal diagnostic services we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health profiles of the research models and cell lines used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued use characterization and utilization of specific disease models and gems allows us to be well positioned to be the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in field of animal diagnostics 

other related research model products and services we also offer two other categories of products and services within rms— in vitro products and avian vaccine services 

in vitro our in vitro business provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination we are committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible and toward that goal we work with and support the european center for validation of alternative methods in these efforts endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and most successful fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test to date the extraction of blood does not harm the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our in vitro business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services which are used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured 

our growth in the in vitro business is driven by our fda approved line of next generation endotoxin testing products which are based on the endosafe portable testing system endosafe®pts™ technology that allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment in recent years we have expanded the pts product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the endosafemcs multi cartridge system in response to the demand of our higher testing volume customers we anticipate continued adoption of rapid methods as our customers respond to the fdas process analytical technology pat initiative in addition we are planning to introduce a fully automated mcs in late 2011 which will assist in penetrating our customers highvolume central testing laboratories we also expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in nontraditional areas such as renal dialysis nuclear and compounding pharmacies and cellular therapy in addition we are currently exploring obtaining 510k medical device approval of this technology for clinical diagnostic applications 

avian vaccine services we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf fertile chicken eggs and chickens spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is performed under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence in north america with several spf egg production facilities in the united states contracted production capabilities in hungary and a franchise operation in india we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

preclinical services pcs our pcs customers are principally engaged in the discovery and development of new drugs devices and therapies 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically last anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development activities which follow and which can take up to 710 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials 

the development services portion of our pcs business enables our customers to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired toxicology and related drug development activities to us the demand for these services has historically been driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of 

larger global pharmaceutical companies the necessary significant investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently conduct these activities means that global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have frequently chosen to outsource their development activities allowing them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and particularly for pharmaceutical companies promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of general and specialty toxicology studies especially those dealing with innovative therapies and biologicals we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada and europe we also have a small facility in shanghai china as to which we announced in december 2010 we are pursuing strategic alternatives our pcs segment represented 41 of our total net sales from continuing operations in 2010 and employed 480 of our employees including approximately 330 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees excluding employees at our sites included in discontinued operations 

we currently offer the following preclinical services in which we include both in vivo and in vitro studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development 

toxicology toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected appropriate toxicology studies are conducted in support of clinical trials in humans these toxicology studies are typically performed in laboratory models to elucidate the potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods and focus on safety and assessment of harmful effects our toxicology services feature 

• all the standard protocols for general toxicity testing genotoxicity safety pharmacology acute subacute chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity bioassays required for regulatory submissions supporting firstinhuman to firsttothemarket strategies • expertise in specialty routes of administration and modes of administration eg infusion intravitreal intrathecal and inhalation which are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals but also for the safety testing of medical devices industrial chemicals food additives agrochemicals biocides nutraceuticals animal health products and other materials • marketleading expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in support of larger scale and laterstage human clinical trials • services in important specialty areas such as ocular bone juvenileneonatal immunotoxicity photobiology and dermal testing • work in all major therapeutic areas • study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience and scientific expertise in support of drug development and • a strong history of assisting our clients in achieving their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing including studies addressing stem cell therapies dna vaccines protein biotherapeutics small molecules and medical devices our toxicology facilities operate in compliance with good laboratory practices glps as required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities as well as our own and our customers quality assurance departments 

pathology services in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety of potential new therapeutics we employ a large number of highly trained veterinary pathologists and other scientists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical not only for regulatorydriven 

safety studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key gonogo decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our customers are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis for preclinical study support we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied to higher doses that may result in adverse effects our clients require these studies for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug the results of which are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

discovery support at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the activity and efficacy of drug candidates in several important therapeutic areas including 

• bone disease using our stateoftheart imaging and pathology capabilities • ophthalmology using our models of neovascularization • general cardiovascular and device testing using our surgical models and • oncology we also offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business are complementary to the discovery services that we offer through our rms business 

biopharmaceutical services we provide specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology developers our laboratories in the united states germany scotland and ireland provide timely compliant molecular biology virology bioanalytical immunochemistry microbiology and related services we confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this testing is required by the fda and other global regulatory authorities for our customers to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we also collaborate with clients on process development validation and manufacturing scaleup 

discontinued operations— phase i clinical trials 

we currently offer phase i clinical research services through our clinic in tacoma washington however we have announced that we are currently pursuing strategic alternatives for this business and are no longer including this business unit in our continuing operations phase i clinical trials are usually short duration studies conducted on a small number 20100 of healthy human subjects although 

special populations can be used under highly controlled conditions testing is usually performed where trial participants can be closely monitored in a secure environment such as at a clinictype facility or hospital our clinical services capabilities are located at our premier phase i clinic in tacoma washington with a capacity of 250 beds 

the phase i clinical trials and other services we currently provide at our tacoma site are subject to a specific regulatory environment human clinical trials are conducted in a progressive fashion beginning with phase i and in the case of approved drugs continued through phase iv trials phase i studies are the initial human clinical trials and are conducted with a small number of subjects under highly controlled conditions these clinical trials and services are performed in accordance with the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practice consolidated guidance and in compliance with regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human clinical trial subjects fda regulations do not require a quality assurance program however our phase i facility has an established quality assurance unit that monitors the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients in accelerating the search for drugs and other therapies from fundamental research to in vivo discovery through preclinical development our goal is to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of earlystage products and services for academic research drug discovery and development and to partner with our clients by providing the greatest value and strategic benefit as a premier contract research organization with a portfolio of products and services that spans the earlystage development platform from research models through preclinical development we are able to collaborate with clients at the earliest stages when critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutic agents will remain in development and to work alongside them as drug candidates move downstream through the preclinical development process in particular our recognized expertise in in vivo biology throughout our rms and pcs businesses provides us with a competitive advantage in understanding our customers drug candidates and the challenges faced during the discovery and development process including nonglp efficacy and safety testing critical for gonogo decisionmaking 

our business is primarily driven by the trend towards virtualization of and increase in outsourced services by our customers along with research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the federal government and academic institutions outsourcing allows our customers to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on early drug discovery and for more mature companies marketing while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours who can help optimize our clients programs and assist in accelerating their drug discovery and development process our strategy is to capitalize on these opportunities by continuing to build our portfolio of premium valueadded products and services through internal development and investment augmented by strategic targeted bolton transactions 

charles river is positioned to address our customers future needs and improve the efficiency and speed of their drug development activities as we provide a multifaceted value proposition that enables us to 

• provide external expertise which may be too costly for our customers to build andor maintain inhouse • leverage integrated offerings from our two business segments rms and pcs • partner with customers to allow them to compensate for recent capacity andor staff reductions • provide flexible arrangements to better balance our clients workloadstaff requirements often reducing their personnel and operating costs 8 

• provide customized solutions across therapeutic area • draw upon our higher utilization and efficiencies to our clients advantage including the use of purposebuilt facilities designed for high throughput • address our customers demands for noncore but strategically important in vivo biology activities and specialty services such as general and specialty toxicology and program management that are prohibitive for customers to maintain inhouse and • provide additional value to our customers through broadbased partnerships across the breadth of the charles river portfolio in todays business environment we believe there is a particular advantage in being a global full service highquality provider of nonclinical services throughout the drug discovery and development continuum many of our customers especially large pharmaceutical companies are attracted to tier 1 contract research organizations with a full breadth of capabilities and choose to establish preferred provider relationships with only a small number which allows them to simplify their relationship management as well as access greater value from their outsourcing partner recent trends suggest that large pharmaceutical restructurings with increased focus on key therapeutic areas may favor larger contract research organizations who can present customers with the benefits of economies of scale and scope extensive therapeutic area expertise global footprint and simplified communications and coordination those companies with critical mass and financial stability are likely to have an advantage as we expect that customers will gravitate towards placing studies with providers they can rely upon we are focused on being recognized as a premier preferred provider and building broader and deeper longterm strategic partnerships with our customers accordingly with many of our largest customers we enter into global preferred provider agreements that span both segments of our business in addition in response to individual customer needs we remain flexible and open to broadbased multiyear partnering arrangements which may take various and customized forms and which tap into the broad array of physical andor service resources that we provide eg reserving dedicated space within existing facilities building out space to a particular specification working within our clients infrastructure and occasionally establishing a new facility 

this strategy and focus has been developed in recognition of the needs and desires of our customers who are increasingly facing pressure to manage their research and development costs while at the same time maintaining or developing a strong pipeline of innovative new drugs conduct research and development in multiple countries simultaneously and identify hire and retain a breadth of scientific and technical experts it is both risky and expensive to bring a new prescription drug to market it is estimated that only 4 in 5000  10000 investigational drugs that begin preclinical testing will progress to human testing and only one of those will be approved for human use according to various reports it takes 10 to 16 years and costs in the range of 180 million to 20 billion with an average cost of over 900 million to bring a new drug to market 12 billion for a biologic furthermore costs associated with developing new drugs and biologics are increasing due to a variety of factors including 

• price inflation • fast moving technological advances highthroughput screening combinatorial chemistry genomics proteomics which have increased the investment costs to conduct research and development • increased challenges in addressing unmet needs eg chronic diseases • increased costs and extended timelines due to the difficulty in conducting global clinical trials and • increasing clinical trial complexity size and extended timelines due to increased requirements to demonstrate efficacy safety and cost effectiveness 9 

in order to convert largely fixed costs into variable expenses and to facilitate and speed their research our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are making strategic decisions to outsource a portfolio of services to highquality full service providers like us during the past decade we believe that the growth of outsourcing by our customers has been driven by a unique confluence of events including 

• the current outlook for drugs coming off patent protection and resulting threats from generic drug manufacturers which are expected to affect a large percentage of these companies existing revenues • the reduction over the past decade in the growth rate of drugs gaining approval • increased pressure 1 to find drugs to cure and manage chronic diseases many of which are complex and affect small andor aging patient populations and 2 to develop specialty and orphan drugs in both cases increasing risk and cost of development while segmenting and shrinking the patient populations from blockbusters to smaller more specialized indications • continued productivity and cost containment pressures on the medical device diagnostics and biopharmaceutical industries due in part to escalating global healthcare costs increasing concentration of buying power attributable to larger payors and governments while customers in those fields simultaneously need to manage increased financial focus on operating margins and returns • increasing globalization of drug development particularly increased research and development activity in developing countries • heightened regulatory authority scrutiny worldwide particularly concerning drug safety and • scrutiny of the medical value of new drugs being developed as compared to established therapies over the last 23 years our customers have faced a more challenging market environment among the factors that have affected them we have seen the following have the most material impact and negatively affect outsourcing trends 

• large pharmaceutical companies have intensified their costsavings and efficiency actions and have announced significant initiatives to improve their research and development productivity and rationalize their drug pipelines this focus has been manifested through consolidation and reductions in infrastructure spending constraints pricing pressures and project delays and cancellations as well as for a stronger emphasis on laterstage products as they reprioritized compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderated their spending per drug candidate • biotechnology customers particularly those that are cashflow negative have been highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment funding has been improving as large pharmaceutical companies have partnered with or acquired smaller biotechnology companies and has been supplemented to a lesser extent by the capital markets however the universe of biotechnology companies has declined throughout this period which has resulted in less robust spending overall • sponsor consolidation particularly several large and midsized biopharmaceutical company mergers • many customers have narrowed their pipelines to focus on a smaller number of similar highpotential therapeutic areas which may yield the greatest returns with particular focus and competition in oncology metabolismobesity autoimmuneinflammatory central nervous system and infectious disease 10 

• many larger customers have diversified their technology platform bases and have extended their portfolios into biologics therapeutic proteins antibodies rnai and vaccines while retaining their core expertise in small molecules • our customers generally have been focused on nearterm cost controls as they contend with the challenges of the unstable global economy and the expiration of patents on blockbuster drugs and • senior management turnover and structural realignment has resulted in some internal turmoil and slower decisionmaking in some of our larger customers while they finalize and rollout their restructuring plans from a broad perspective over the past 1824 months the large pharmaceutical industry has reexamined its research and development model which has been struggling in recent years with few novel therapeutics developed notwithstanding significant research and development spending we believe three major conclusions have been reached by the industry participants 

• better use of translational medicine may reduce the failure rate of drugs in clinical testing • integrating the discovery to proofofconcept process under a unified leadership structure will allow for improved management and control of the development process and • research and development spending needs to be rationalized further while the consequences of these factors and conclusions have mitigated the outsourcing growth rate trend in the shortterm we believe that these changes will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities going forward in fact we remain optimistic that with the completion of the major mergers and the stabilization of other of the factors addressed above including the successful launch of new therapies currently in latestage development the pharmaceutical industry will return to focusing on driving drugs and therapies through preclinical development also we believe that as larger pharmaceutical companies become leaner and more efficient generally focusing on their core competencies of fundamental research and development and commercialization they will also continue to be conservative in their staffing and further reduce their inhouse expertise this should lead to reinvigoration of outsourcing as they choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure in the aggregate we believe that the evolving large pharmaceutical research and development model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients and allows them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their rd efficiency and cost effectiveness 

in recognition of the changes in demand for our products and services starting in 2009 we began to take decisive actions to address the accelerating changes taking place in the biopharmaceutical industry these actions have been designed to drive shareholder value by aligning our infrastructure to current demand rigorously managing our operating costs and increasing our stock repurchases nonetheless the combination of reduced customer demand cost containment initiatives pursued by our customers and excess capacity within our industry generally has resulted in significant pricing pressure beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2010 in response we have taken significant steps during the past two years to better support our customers in todays challenging environment identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiencies and generally strengthen our business model and provide value to shareholders 

• in 2009 we closed or disposed of less efficient sites including pcs arkansas and our phase i facility in scotland as well as two small rms sites in hungary and belgium and reduced headcount by about 1000 primarily throughout our pcs segment as part of those headcount reductions in early 2010 we decided to suspend operations at our pcs massachusetts site 11 

• also in 2009 we announced two internal organizational restructurings that affected our pcs business and our sales and marketing organization • pcs organizational realignment we restructured our pcs business to create a dual accountability structure with both global functional teams and sitelevel management this structure centralized and integrated our global pcs portfolio and united expertise from various facilities to support our client programs regardless of the specific site at which the program was initiated this structure allows team members to easily share information and best practices globally standardize operations and improve efficiencies throughout charles river most importantly it further enabled us to provide exceptional and consistent service at all levels and across all sites worldwide which is particularly important to those clients who utilize multiple charles river sites • sales and marketing realignment we realigned our enterprisewide sales and marketing team with changes fully implemented at the beginning of 2010 this enhanced our clientcentric focus and communications through the establishment of an integrated sales organization with a threepronged focus on global biopharmaceutical companies small and midsized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and academic and government customers we have designated dedicated sales professionals enhancing our ability to meet customer needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio overall this reorganization allows us to provide more comprehensive coverage and support for all of the market segments among our diverse client base more recently in 2010 we dedicated additional resources to our academic and midsized customers in recognition that these customers are benefiting from investment from large pharmaceutical companies and do not typically maintain large infrastructures • we have also remained focused on internal process improvement initiatives specifically we have continued our investment in our information technology systems and resources in order to better serve our customers harmonize our data and streamline our processes our most visible effort has been the roll out of our integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the first stage which included all of our united states sites as well as our rms site in canada went live at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and in the beginning of our fiscal third quarter 2010 we added our remaining pcs sites in montreal and edinburgh other locations are expected to be added in later stages in addition we have continued to expand our lean six sigma program to reduce process cycle times eliminate nonvalue added steps and optimize our operating efficiencies based on the initial success of the program in our pcs business segment we have recently expanded it to rms to attain similar operational benefits • in july 2010 our board of directors authorized a 5000 million stock repurchase program which was increased by 2500 million to 7500 million on october 20 2010 subsequent to the initial authorization in august 2010 we entered into an agreement to implement an accelerated stock repurchase asr program with a third party investment banker to repurchase 3000 million of common stock in total we received 8871829 shares under the asr through its completion in february 2011 following the completion of the asr program we have 3971 million remaining on our 7500 million stock repurchase authorization our present intention is to complete the initial 5000 million of the stock repurchase authorization in 2011 • in november 2010 we announced a number of additional costsavings actions including a reduction of headcount by approximately 4 across our pcs rms and corporate functions the closure of a small leased pcs satellite facility in quebec canada consolidation of our michigan discovery services operations with our larger facility in north carolina and further reductions in discretionary spending levels • in december 2010 we announced an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow charles river to drive profitable growth and maximizing value for shareholders and thus better 12 

position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment these four key initiatives are 

• improving our consolidated operating margin including pursuing strategic alternatives for certain nonstrategic or underperforming pcs assets including our us phase i clinic and china preclinical facility • improving free cash flow generation • disciplined investment in growth business such as gems discovery services in vitro and biopharmaceutical services and • returning value to shareholders such as through stock repurchase programs in light of our actions and intensified focus we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities as strategic outsourcing by our customers increases we believe that our expertise in areas previously addressed by our customers inhouse capabilities allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them in short because these products and services are the core of our business we are able to build and maintain expertise and tap into economies of scale that are difficult for our customers to match within their internal infrastructure 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the earlystage drug development continuum primarily through internal development which will be augmented as needed through focused bolton acquisitions and alliances our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value this strategy may include geographic expansion of existing core services strengthening our core services or the addition of a new product or service in a related or adjacent business 

in addition as our customers narrow their focus toward specific therapeutic areas we have increasingly aligned our services portfolio along therapeutic lines particularly those subject to major research funding or focus such as oncology metabolism and obesity autoimmuneinflammation cardiovascular infectious disease and central nervous system we have also focused on adding expertise in the biologics development areas as a result of these collective efforts we expect to be better positioned to gain market share by taking advantage of these trends as well as broaderbased collaboration across the earlystage drug development continuum 

customers 

we maintain a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

• global biopharmaceutical companies • small and midsized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and • academic and government customers our customers continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies animal health medical device diagnostic and other life sciences companies and leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our customers during 2010 no single commercial customer accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 12 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 12 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we have designated dedicated sales people for each our three customer segments enhancing our ability to meet customer needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers will benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams the majority of whom work in north america with the balance in europe and the asiapacific countries in addition to interactions with our direct sale force our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters webinars and making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain locales our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents for our products and services particularly with respect to our in vitro and biopharmaceutical services businesses 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments in addition to project managers for our service businesses which address both our customers routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical and clinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our customers 

our marketing efforts are focused to stimulate demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of in vivo biology are increasingly attractive to our customers and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition 

our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation responsiveness pricing innovation breadth of therapeutic and scientific expertise timeliness and availability supported by our professional bench strength in in vivo biology and toxicology global capabilities and strategically located facilities worldwide we are able to offer a unique portfolio to support earlystage drug development through our wide range of research models and research model services discovery and imaging services and our broad array of preclinical services including both general and specialty toxicology 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

• for rms our main competitors include three smaller companies in north america each of whom has a global scope and several smaller competitors in europe and in japan of our main us competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our main competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships • as for pcs we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world based on net service revenue our commercial competitors for preclinical services consist of both publicly held and privately owned companies and it is estimated that the top eight 14 

participants including charles river account for a significant portion of the global outsourced preclinical market with the rest of the market remaining highly fragmented our pcs segment also competes with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies universities and teaching hospitals 

we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs  provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 25 2010 we had approximately 7500 employees including approximately 450 professionals with advanced scientific degrees including phds dvms and mds excluding those in businesses designated as discontinued operations our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our satisfaction surveys indicate that we have an excellent relationship with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment from continuing operations was 2199 million at december 25 2010 as compared to 2688 million at december 26 2009 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a customers intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog we do not report backlog for our rms business segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2010 backlog may be completed in 2010 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be 

terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments as described below 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs aaalac covers all species of laboratory animals including rats mice and birds our preclinical business is also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical laboratory safety studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients products throughout the world a minor part of our rms business also conducts similar studies for our clients the conduct of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european medicines agency ema medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada state food and drug administration of the peoples republic of china and the japanese ministry of health and welfare glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations we are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cgmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities we also maintain an establishment license with usdas center for veterinary biologics cvb that covers certain of our sites which manufacture antigens used in a licensed diagnostic kit for rodents or—particular to our avian vaccine services—which manufacture usda licensed antigens antibodies and viruses that are sold to clients for use in the manufacturing of their own usda licensed products our vaccine support business also manufactures and markets three usda licensed products that are considered final use products mycoplasma gallisepticum antigen mycoplasma melegridis antigen and mycoplasma synoviae antigen and sites involved in the manufacture of these articles are subject to regular inspection by usdacvb 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we have established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all quality assurance functions within the company 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and through registration of title or use in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services business in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhancing our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our in vitro testing business including the endosafepts and our pathology based software development activities through our systems pathology company subsidiary we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of the products or services we offer are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 ten of the eleven members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to the company or management and all of our board committees with the exception of our executive committee and our strategic planning and capital allocation committee are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the investor relations—corporate governance caption 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

  set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past decade our businesses have grown as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development a decrease in preclinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in fact in 2010 our revenues for our pcs segment declined 88 from 2009 and 2009 revenues were down 195 from 2008 for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k furthermore our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on compounds in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology customers particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets although funds disbursed through the american recovery and reinvestment act may have provided some offset similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including funding for biotechnology companies which have suffered during the recent economic downturn also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the research and development budgets at our pharmaceutical customers have recently down their preclinical studies in favor of their laterstage products as they reprioritize compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate furthermore our customers particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies that can be difficult to forecast government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities other programs such as homeland security or defense or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the united states government as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years and a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the united states strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in march 2010 the united states congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures this legislation may significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in addition the us congress various state legislatures and european and asian governments may consider various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are presently uncertain as to the effects of the recently enacted legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any 

implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contains costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our customers may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

  any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties damages and fines any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably there has been a recent updating of guidance in europe that will be implemented over a period of several years on a countrybycountry basis because of the complexities of the formal adoption process the finalization and implementation of this guidance will likely take three or more years similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants in the united states in 2010 guidance used by the national institutes of health and by certain oversight agencies for the care and use of laboratory animals has been completed and it is expected to be implemented in 2011 

furthermore certain of our customers may require us to comply with this new guidance in advance of its implementation as a condition to being awarded contracts conforming to these new guidelines will likely cause us increased costs attributable to additional facilities the need to add personnel to address new processes as well as increased administrative burden and the upgrading of existing facilities 

  our standard customer agreements contain customerdetermined termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

• the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements • unexpected or undesired study results • production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested • the customers decision to forego or terminate a particular study • the loss of funding for the particular research study or • for general conveniencecustomer preference if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business particularly our pcs segment and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may underprice or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the customer the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventitious infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and 

possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our customers facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in man and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it likely the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including customer relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2010 the fair value of our pcs business 

was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 3050 million 

goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 25 2010 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 3197 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf our total net sales in recent years we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

• foreign currencies we receive for sales and which we record as expenses outside the united states could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue and increase the amount of expenses that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results • certain contracts particularly in canada are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations • general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate • potential international conflicts including terrorist acts • potential trade restrictions exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states • difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of violations of local laws or the us foreign corrupt practices act by employees overseas or the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements • the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations • unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of us and foreign tax laws • longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and • import and export licensing requirements negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant 

animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention impacting the industry this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large research models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for our services we compete on a variety of factors including 

• reputation for ontime quality performance • reputation for regulatory compliance • expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas • scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum • broad geographic availability with consistent quality • pricevalue • technological expertise and efficient drug development processes • quality of facilities • financial stability • size and • ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies although recent trends since 2008 also demonstrated increased merger activity between larger pharmaceutical companies themselves if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and contract research organizations generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and roll up these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore in recent years both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area invested significantly in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing existing and sometimes excess capacity and 

market demand where capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects can occur more generally our competitors or others might develop technologies services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies services or products or that render our technologies services or products less competitive or obsolete if competitors introduce superior technologies services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive our competitive position and in turn our business revenue and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us tax law 

in its budget submission to congress in february 2010 and reiterated in the administrations 2012 budget proposal released on february 14 2011 the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies the proposed changes include among others limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense allocated and apportioned to offshore earnings and modifying the foreign tax credit rules while it is uncertain how the us congress may address this issue reform of us taxation including taxation of international income continues to be a topic of discussion for the us congress although the scope of the proposed changes remains unclear and the likelihood of enactment is uncertain it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase the companys effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from enhanced deductions and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or deductions would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits cash flow and our effective tax rate 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

• errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical or phase i clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing • litigation risk including resulting from our errors or omissions associated with the possibility that the drugscompounds of our clients that were included in drug development trials we participated in may cause illness personal injury or have other negative side effects to clinical study participants or other persons including death • general risks associated with operating a phase i clinical business including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers • risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers property such as research models and samples study compounds records work in progress other archived materials or goods and materials in transit while in our possession • risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals 25 

• risk that we may have errors and omissions related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs primarily through our in vitro business or in the testing of biologicals and other services performed by our biopharmaceutical services business which could result in us or our customers failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials and • errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections 

in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients investigators and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging technology could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method or other method that reduces the need for animal research models as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets for instance in recent years we acquired imaging capabilities through our acquisitions of mir and cerebricon however we generally may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales in addition other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by our customers 

upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

in 2010 we completed the initial implementation of a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the first stage which included all of our united states sites as well as our rms site in canada went live at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and in the beginning of our fiscal third quarter 2010 we added our remaining pcs sites in montreal and edinburgh we are now enhancing the value of the systems reporting capabilities the expansion of the system to other 

international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business in general the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated widescale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products 

we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings for instance in 2009 we acquired system pathology company llc a pathology based software development company focused on developing stateoftheart analytical imaging technologies to automate the labor intensive tissue evaluations process which is a significant component of standard preclinical studies and in 2010 we announced we entered into an exclusive longterm marketing and distribution agreement with transposagen biopharmaceuticals inc a lexington kentuckybased provider of unique genetically modified rat models if we are unable to develop new services and products andor create demand for those newly developed services and products our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 25 2010 we had approximately 7009 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 5 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire or in managing our current and future divestitures our business may suffer 

during the past decade we have expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products or technologies • challenges with developing and operating new businesses • diversion of managements attention from other business concerns • potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller • acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders • loss of key employees • risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies • risks that disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business technology service or product may result in litigation expenses and distribution of our managements attention • the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies and • difficulties in achieving business and financial success in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business site or product line in addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel and • the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses for example on december 14 2010 we announced that we intended to explore strategic alternatives for certain nonstrategic or underperforming pcs assets including our us phase i clinic and the china preclinical facility these and any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business site or product line and as a result we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of customer data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical and the clinical studies we conduct for our customers unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard but in the event that our 

efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our customers typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for almost 35 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our management if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

• changes in the general global economy • the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements • the commencement postponement delay progress completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter • changes in the mix of our products and services • the extent of cost overruns • holiday patterns of our customers • budget cycles of our customers • the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events and • exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

we continually evaluate capacity in light of our customer needs and demands accordingly in january 2010 we announced that we had decided to suspend operations at our shrewsbury massachusetts facility by the middle of 2010 with the intention to resume operations when global preclinical market conditions improve and we require additional capacity currently we do not anticipate significant expansion requirements in either our rms or pcs businesses for the next few years due to available capacity at existing and suspended sites however we may expand at specific sites should we determine that it is not feasible to utilize available capacity at existing or suspended sites 

we are pursuing strategic alternatives for our us phase i clinical site in tacoma washington and for our pcs operation in shanghai china similarly we have announced the consolidation of our discovery services site in ann arbor michigan with our operations in north carolina the real estate associated with these operations is leased and depending on the resolution of these situations we may be encumbered with the remaining real estate lease obligations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following managements discussion and analysis will help you understand the financial condition and results of operations the managements discussion and analysis is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently our broad portfolio of products and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed to market and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development we have built upon our core competency of in vivo biology including laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of services which address drug discovery and development in the preclinical arena we have been in business for over 60 years and currently operate approximately 68 facilities in 16 countries worldwide 

our market for our goods and services continues to be in transition and we are uncertain as to when the unfavorable market demand factors which continue to negatively impact our results of operations will abate these market factors which have existed since 2008 include measured research and development spending by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due to the impact of the slower economy significant impact from consolidations in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry significant patent expirations delays in customer decisions and commitments tight cost constraints by our customers and recognition of excess preclinical capacity within our industry which has resulted in pricing pressure a focus on latestage human testing as customers endeavor to bring drugs further down the development pipeline to market and the impact of healthcare reform initiatives all of these ongoing factors contribute to demand uncertainty and impacted sales in 2010 

as we look forward we continue to anticipate that demand particularly for preclinical services will begin to ramp up as our customers reinvigorate their earlystage drug development pipelines continue to choose outsourcing of services to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of their drug development efforts and reduce their internal capacity through closure of underutilized facilities we believe that increased focus on strategic outsourcing by our customers should result in the expansion of strategic relationships with a reduced and limited number of partners which will drive demand for our services we believe that the longterm drivers for our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our customers continued demand for research models and services and regulatory compliant preclinical services which are essential to the drug development process however presently it is challenging to predict the timing associated with these drivers 

in response to the challenging market environment during the past few years which has continued through 2010 we have taken significant steps to better support our customers identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiencies and generally strengthen our business model for additional discussion of these steps please see the section entitled our strategy included in item 1 in this form 10k 

additionally in december 2010 we announced an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and to maximize value for shareholders and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment these four initiatives are detailed 

• improving the consolidated operating margin by continuing to aggressively manage our cost structure and drive operating efficiencies we expect to generate improving operating margins 37 

depending on the strength of recovery in demand for preclinical services we have already implemented significant actions to reduce costs during the last two years to manage our business in the challenging industrywide preclinical market conditions in addition we announced in december 2010 that we intended to pursue strategic alternatives for nonstrategic or underperforming pcs assets including the us phase i clinic now reclassified as discontinued operations and the china preclinical facility these actions are expected to contribute to improved operating margins in the future 

• improving free cash flow generation we currently believe we have adequate capacity to support revenue growth in both business segments without significant additional investment for expansion improved operating margins elimination of the specified operating losses and minimal requirements for capital expansion should contribute to generate strong cash flow • disciplined investment in growth businesses we expect to maintain a disciplined focus on deployment of capital investing in those areas of our existing business which will generate the greatest sales growth and profitability such as gems discovery services in vitro products and biopharmaceutical services • returning value to shareholders on july 29 2010 the board of directors authorized a 5000 million stock repurchase program and increased the authorization to 7500 million on october 20 2010 under the authorization in 2010 we initiated a substantial stock repurchase program which is intended to drive immediate shareholder value and earnings per share accretion we intend to complete the initial 5000 million of the boards stock repurchase authorization in 2011 our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2010 the fair value of our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 3050 million 

as a result of our decision to pursue strategic alternatives for our preclinical facility in china in the fourth quarter we recognized an impairment of 172 million additionally we determined the fair value of our in process research and development acquired in the acquisition of system pathology company llc spc the fair value of the in process research and development was less than the carrying value recorded at the time of the acquisition based on the evaluation we recorded an impairment of 72 million also in the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined we would not be utilizing our pcsmassachusetts facility in the foreseeable future we performed a fair value assessment of that site which resulted in our recording an impairment of 646 million 

total net sales in 2010 were 11 billion a decrease of 33 from 2009 the sales decrease was due primarily to lower demand and pricing pressure for pcs and moderately slower demand for rms the effect of foreign currency translation had a positive impact on sales of 01 our gross margin decreased to 339 of net sales compared to 361 of net sales in 2009 due primarily to lower sales 

our operating lossincome for 2010 was 2985 million compared to 1696 million for 2009 lossincome from continuing operations net of tax was 3341 million in 2010 compared to 1112 million in 2009 the operating loss is primarily due to the goodwill impairment asset impairments and the 300 million wuxi termination fee the diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2010 was 525 compared to diluted earnings per share of 172 in 2009 our capital expenditures totaled 429 million for 2010 compared to 799 million for 2009 our planned capital expenditures in 2011 are approximately 500 million net lossincome attributable to common shareowners for 2010 was 3367 million in 2010 compared to 1144 million in 2009 

we report two segments rms and pcs which reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed 

our rms segment which represented 588 of net sales in 2010 includes sales of research models genetically engineered models and services gems research animal diagnostics rads discovery services ds consulting and staffing services css vaccine support and our in vitro business net sales for this segment increased 11 compared to 2009 with the addition of piedmont research center and cerebricon ltd partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 05 we experienced decreases in both the rms gross margin from 422 to 417 and operating margin from 293 to 277 compared to last year due mainly to the impact of our fixed costs with flat sales partially offset by cost savings 

our pcs segment which represented 412 of net sales in 2010 includes services required to take a drug through the development process including discovery support toxicology pathology biopharmaceutical bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services sales for this segment decreased 88 over 2009 driven by slower demand for preclinical services partially offset by favorable foreign currency which increased sales growth by 09 we experienced a decrease in the pcs gross margin from 282 in 2009 to 228 in 2010 due mainly to lower capacity utilization due to the lower sales volume and increased pricing pressure the 2010 operating margin was a negative 841 compared to a positive 78 in 2009 mainly due to the goodwill impairment and asset impairments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

we consider the following accounting estimates important in understanding our operating results and financial condition for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements—note 1 significant accounting policies  

valuation and impairment of goodwill other intangible assets and other longlived assets 

valuation of certain longlived assets including property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of longlived assets typically key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 

we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it likely the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount to determine if impairment 

exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on internal projections key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including customer relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2010 the fair value of our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 3050 million 

additionally we performed an assessment of the fair value of our inprocess research and development acquired in the acquisition of spc the fair value of the inprocess research and development was less than the carrying value recorded as the time of the acquisition based on the evaluation we recorded an impairment of 72 million 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 25 2010 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 3197 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

for intangible assets goodwill and property plant and equipment we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

• significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 40 

• significant negative industry or economic trends or • significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our longlived assets should we determine that the carrying value of longlived tangible assets may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

the fourth quarter of 2010 was impacted by continuing market factors which include measured spending by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due to the impact of the slower economy significant impact from consolidations in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry delays in customer decisions and commitments tight cost constraints by our customers and recognition of excess preclinical capacity within our industry which has resulted in pricing pressure a focus on latestage human testing as customers endeavor to bring drugs further down the development pipeline to market and the impact of healthcare reform initiatives all of these ongoing factors contribute to demand uncertainty and have impacted sales in 2010 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 based on our most recent market outlook we assessed our longlived assets for impairment the assessment included an evaluation of the ongoing cash flows of the longlived assets we determined based upon our evaluation that the longlived assets associated with pcsmassachusetts and pcschina were no longer fully recoverable from the future cash flows based upon the assets no longer being fully recoverable we determined the fair value of the longlived assets based upon a valuation completed by an independent third party valuation firm the valuation was based upon the estimated market value of the longlived assets and the future cash flow expected to be generated from the longlived assets accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of 646 million for pcsmassachusetts and 172 million for pcschina representing the excess of the carrying value of those assets over their respective fair market values 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue related to our products which include research models in vitro technology and vaccine support products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally in the form of customer purchase orders title and risk of loss have transferred which occurs upon delivery of the products the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured these recognition criteria are met at the time the product is delivered to the customers site product sales are recorded net of returns upon delivery for large models in some cases customers pay in advance of delivery of the product these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product 

our service revenue is comprised of toxicology pathology laboratory gems ds and css and is generally evidenced by customer contracts toxicology services provide highly specialized studies to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new pharmaceutical compounds and materials used in medical devices pathology services provide the ability to identify and characterize pathologic changes within tissues and cells in determining the safety of a new compound laboratory services monitor and analyze the health and genetics of research models used in research protocols gems services include validating maintaining breeding and testing research models for biomedical research activities ds augments our gems services by providing efficacy studies and other services required as drugs progress through the development popeline css provides management of animal care operations on behalf of government academic pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations 

the toxicology and pathology services arrangements typically range from one to six months but can range up to approximately 24 months in length these agreements are negotiated for a fixed fee laboratory service arrangements are generally completed within a onemonth period and are also of a fixed fee nature ds services are also shortterm in nature while gems and css are longerterm from six months to five years and are billed at agreed upon rates as specified in the contract 

our service revenue is recognized upon the completion of the agreed upon performance criteria these performance criteria are generally in the form of either study protocols or specified activities or procedures which we are engaged to perform these performance criteria are established by our customers and do not contain acceptance provisions which are based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to estimated costs to complete procedures specified by customers in the form of study protocols in general such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules but are recognized as revenue as services are performed as a result of the reviews revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known 

deferred and unbilled revenue are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the customer and recognized as unbilled receivable as of december 25 2010 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 271 million and deferred revenue of 669 million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts 

pension plan accounting 

our defined benefit pension plans assets liabilities and expenses are calculated by accredited independent actuaries using certain assumptions which are approved by management the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 25 2010 the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans was 510 as of december 25 2010 we had a pension liability of 364 million 

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the asset allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 19 million 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service 

period which is generally the vesting period during the year ended december 25 2010 we recognized 255 million of stock compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock and performance based stock awards we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straightline basis over the vesting periods of the awards net of estimated forfeitures forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility expected term expected dividends and riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated on at least an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 

we record deferred tax assets for stockbased awards based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of income at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction differences between the deferred tax assets and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paidin capital if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense our pool of excess tax benefits in computed in accordance with the long form method 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future we may need to increase or decrease income tax expense which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

as of december 25 2010 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 318 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us federal and state taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is our policy to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our nonus subsidiaries unless they can be repatriated in a manner that generates a tax benefit or an unforeseen cash need arises in the united states and the earnings can be repatriated in a manner that is substantially free of income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our tax provision is based upon 

enacted tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments resolutions of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



segment operations 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling 

general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 





in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net sales net sales in 2010 were 11334 million a decrease of 382 million or 33 from 11716 million in 2009 

research models and services in 2010 net sales for our rms segment were 6670 million an increase of 71 million or 11 from 6599 million in 2009 sales growth was driven by the additions of piedmont research center and cerebricon both of which were acquired in 2009 partially offset by lower sales of research models 

preclinical services in 2010 net sales for our pcs segment were 4664 million a decrease of 453 million or 88 compared to 5117 million in 2009 the decrease in pcs sales was primarily due to reduced biopharmaceutical spending which resulted in lower sales volume and pricing pressure favorable foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 09 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2010 was 7486 million essentially flat with 2009 cost of products sold and services provided in 2010 was 661 of net sales compared to 639 in 2009 due mainly to lower sales 

research models and services cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2010 was 3886 million an increase of 74 million or 19 compared to 3812 million in 2009 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales in 2010 was 583 compared to 578 in 2009 the increase in cost as a percentage of sales was due mainly to the impact of increased fixed costs with a small sales increase partially offset by cost savings 

preclinical services cost of services provided for the pcs segment in 2010 was 3600 million a decrease of 74 million or 20 compared to 3674 million in 2009 cost of services provided as a percentage of net sales was 772 in 2010 compared to 718 in 2009 the increase in cost of services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower capacity utilization due to the lower sales volume and increased pricing pressure 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 were 2325 million an increase of 48 million or 21 from 2277 million in 2009 selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 were 205 of net sales compared to 194 of net sales in 2009 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower sales 

research models and services selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2010 were 858 million an increase of 67 million or 85 compared to 791 in 2009 selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to 129 in 2010 from 120 in 2009 due mainly to the reinstatement of limited meritbased wage increases coupled with increased allocations of corporate marketing and it costs 

preclinical services selling general and administrative expenses for the pcs segment in 2010 were 734 million a decrease of 117 million or 136 compared to 851 million in 2009 due mainly to reduced allocations of corporate marketing and it costs and tight expense control over discretionary costs selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 decreased to 158 of net sales compared to 166 in 2009 

unallocated corporate overhead unallocated corporate overhead which consists of various costs primarily related to activities centered at our corporate headquarters such as compensation including stockbased compensation information systems compliance and facilities expenses associated with our corporate administration and professional services functions was 733 million in 2010 compared to 635 million in 2009 the increase in unallocated corporate overhead during 2010 was due primarily to increased global it costs and costs related to the implementation of our erp system in 2010 and increased costs associated with the evaluation of acquisition candidates 

goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2010 the fair value of our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 3050 million 

asset impairment during the fourth quarter of 2010 based on our most recent market outlook we assessed our longlived assets for impairment the assessment included an evaluation of the ongoing cash flows of the longlived assets we determined based upon our evaluation that the longlived assets associated with pcsmassachusetts and pcschina were no longer fully recoverable from the future cash flows based upon the assets no longer being fully recoverable we determined the fair value of the longlived assets based upon a valuation completed by an independent third party valuation firm the valuation was based upon the estimated market value of the longlived assets and the future cash flow expected to be generated from the longlived assets accordingly we recorded impairment charges of 646 million for pcsmassachusetts 172 million for pcschina and 72 million for inprocess research and development costs representing the excess of the carrying value of the spc assets over their respective fair market values 

termination fee on july 29 2010 we signed a termination agreement with wuxi pharmatech cayman inc wuxi to terminate the previously announced acquisition agreement in accordance with the terms of the termination agreement on july 29 2010 we paid wuxi a 300 million termination fee for full satisfaction of the parties obligations under the acquisition agreement

preclinical services in 2010 operating loss for our pcs segment was 3797 million compared to operating income of 398 million in 2009 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to our 3050 million goodwill impairment our 646 million pcsmassachusetts impairment and 172 million pcschina impairment 

interest expense interest expense in 2010 was 353 million compared to 217 million in 2009 the increase was due to increased debt balances 

interest income interest income in 2010 was 12 million compared to 17 million in 2009 primarily due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates on invested funds 

income taxes income tax expense in 2010 was 23 thousand compared to 404 million in 2009 our effective tax rate was 00 in 2010 compared to 266 in 2009 changes in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from goodwill and fixed asset impairments that were unbenefitted for tax purposes amount and mix of earnings increased tax benefits related to our research and development activities in canada and the uk and the cost of repatriating foreign earnings that were formerly permanently reinvested 

income from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of 2010 we initiated actions to divest our phase i clinical services business we engaged an investment banker and were actively trying to sell the phase i clinical services business at year end on december 25 2010 taking into account the planned divestiture of the phase i clinical services business we performed an impairment test on the longlived assets of the phase i clinical services business based on this analysis we determined that the book value of assets assigned to the phase i clinical services business exceeded its future cash flows which included the proceeds from the sale of the business and therefore recorded an impairment of the assets of 64 million

research models and services in 2009 net sales for our rms segment were 6599 million flat compared to 2008 sales growth from the additions of piedmont research center mir preclinical services and cerebricon was offset by softer demand for research model products and services a 13 negative impact from foreign currency translation and the divestiture of the vaccine business in mexico 

preclinical services in 2009 net sales for our pcs segment were 5117 million a decrease of 1237 million or 195 compared to 6354 million in 2008 the decrease in pcs sales was primarily due to slower demand for preclinical services and unfavorable foreign currency which decreased sales growth by 34 partially offset by full year impact of the newlab acquisition 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2009 was 7486 million a decrease of 479 million or 60 from 7965 million in 2008 cost of products sold and services provided in 2009 was 639 of net sales compared to 615 in 2008

liquidity and capital resources 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations our marketable securities and our revolving line of credit arrangements 

on august 26 2010 we amended and restated our 4280 million credit agreement to 1 repay loans outstanding under the 4280 million credit agreement 2 extend the maturity date under this new 7500 million credit facility to august 26 2015 and 3 terminate and repay the remaining term loan under our 500 million credit agreement the 7500 million credit agreement which has a maturity date of august 26 2015 provides for a 2300 million us term loan a 1338 million euro term loan and a 3500 million revolver under specified circumstances we have the ability to increase the term loans andor revolving line of credit by up to 2500 million in the aggregate deferred financing costs associated with the new 7500 million credit agreement were 141 million of which 96 million were capitalized and will amortize over 5 years and 45 million which were expensed our obligations under the 7500 million credit agreement are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets including a pledge of 100 of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries other than the capital stock of any domestic subsidiary that is 

treated as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes and 65 of the capital stock of certain firsttier foreign subsidiaries and domestic disregarded entities and mortgages on owned real property in the us having a book value in excess of 100 million the 4000 million term loan facility matures in 20 quarterly installments with the last installment due june 30 2015 the 3500 million us revolving facility matures on august 26 2015 and requires no scheduled payment before that date the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the new 7500 million credit agreement are higher than the interest rates under the prior facilities reflecting greater leverage and current market conditions the new 7500 million credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties affirmative covenants and events of default 

the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of 1 the prime rate 2 the federal funds rate plus 050 or 3 the onemonth adjusted libor rate plus 1 plus an applicable interest rate margin based upon the leverage ratio or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio 

our board of directors authorized a 5000 million stock repurchase program on july 29 2010 and increased the authorization by 2500 million to 7500 million on october 20 2010 in order to enable us to facilitate on a more timely and cost efficient basis the repurchase of a substantial number of our shares pursuant to that stock repurchase authorization on august 26 2010 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty investment banker to implement an accelerated stock repurchase asr program to repurchase 3000 million of common stock under the asr we paid a purchase price of 3000 million on august 27 2010 from cash on hand and available liquidity including funds borrowed by us under our new amended and restated 7500 million credit facility we received an initial delivery on august 27 2010 of 6000000 shares of our common stock the asr program was recorded as two transactions allocated between the initial purchase of treasury shares and a forward contract indexed to our common stock we received an additional 750000 shares under the asr on september 23 2010 and 1250000 shares on december 21 2010 through the end of the fourth quarter we received a total of 8000000 shares under the asr the asr settled on february 11 2011 and we received the final 871829 shares based on a discount to the daily volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over the course of a calculation period the treasury shares result in an immediate reduction of shares on our statement of financial position and in our eps calculation in addition to shares repurchased under the asr during 2010 we repurchased 1759857 shares on the open market at a total cost of 529 million 

the asr resulted in a cash need in the united states that was previously unforeseen in accordance with our policy with respect to the unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries we evaluated whether a portion of the foreign earnings could be repatriated in order to fund the asr we determined that approximately 2298 million of earnings that were previously indefinitely reinvested and approximately 636 million in basis in our nonus subsidiaries could be repatriated in a substantially taxfree manner as such we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to these earnings and accrued the cost to repatriate of 103 million of which 153 million is reflected as income tax expense with an offset of a benefit of 49 million recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account during 2010 we repatriated approximately 2934 million to the us to partially fund the asr and the 300 million wuxi termination fee in accordance with our policy the remaining undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested as of the end of 2010 as they are required to fund needs outside the us and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax free 

as of december 25 2010 we had 212 million in marketable securities with 98 million in time deposits and 114 million in auction rate securities rated aaa by a major credit rating agency our auction rate securities are guaranteed by us federal agencies in june 2010 we received notice of a full call on certain of our auction rate securities at par value of 55 million and received the proceeds in early july 2010 the current overall credit concerns in the capital markets as well as the failed auction status of these securities have impacted our ability to liquidate our auction rate securities if 

the auctions for the securities we own continue to fail the investment may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 

in 2006 we issued 3500 million of 225 convertible senior notes the 2013 notes due in 2013 at december 25 2010 the fair value of our outstanding 2013 notes was approximately 3492 million based on their quoted market value during the fourth quarter of 2010 no conversion triggers were met 

on july 29 2010 we signed a termination agreement with wuxi to terminate the previously announced acquisition agreement in accordance with the terms of the termination agreement we paid wuxi on july 29 2010 a 300 million termination fee for full satisfaction of the parties obligations under the acquisition agreement the termination agreement also included mutual releases of any claims and liabilities arising out of or relating to the acquisition agreement 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 1792 million at december 25 2010 compared to 1826 million at december 26 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 and 2009 was 1682 million and 2156 million respectively the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower earnings which were impacted by the wuxi termination fee our days sales outstanding dso of 45 days as of december 25 2010 has increased from 42 days at december 26 2009 the increase in our dso was primarily driven by decreased deferred revenue as a result of lower pcs sales volume our dso includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation our future net cash provided by operating activities will be impacted by future timing of customer payments for products and services as evidenced in our dso a one day increase or decrease in our dso represents a change of approximately 31 million of cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by used in investing activities in 2010 and 2009 was 30 million and 2091 million respectively our capital expenditures in 2010 were 429 million of which 277 million was related to rms and 152 million to pcs for 2011 we project capital expenditures to be in the range of 500 million we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by operating activities and existing credit facilities net proceeds and purchases of investments in 2010 and 2009 were 449 million and 485 million respectively we paid 833 million for acquisitions during 2009 primarily related to our purchases of piedmont research center systems pathology company llc spc and cerebricon 

net cash used in financing activities in 2010 was 1680 million and 810 million in 2009 during 2010 we used 3565 million for the purchase of treasury stock and the accelerated stock repurchase program as well as repaid debt of 3815 million partially offset by proceeds from debt of 5794 million during 2009 we purchased 459 million of treasury stock and repaid 541 million of debt partially offset by proceeds from debt of 180 million 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 25 2010 are as follows 



the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the conversion features of our 2013 notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements because the conversion features associated with these notes is indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity these instruments are not accounted for as derivatives 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective december 27 2009 we adopted an accounting standard update which addressed the accounting for multipledeliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit specifically this update addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

effective december 27 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements this standard replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 1 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or 2 the right to receive benefits from the entity an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the amendments in this standard also require additional disclosures about a reporting entitys involvement in variable interest entities which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to clarify that the stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively and is not a stock dividend this update was effective for us on december 27 2009 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires new disclosures related to fair value measurements a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers in addition in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 an entity should present separately information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number this update also clarifies existing disclosures by requiring fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques for fair value measurements that fall into level 2 or level 3 this update also includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plans that changes the terminology from major categories of assets to classes of assets this update was effective for us on december 27 2009 and has increased the fair value disclosures made in our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to amend required subsequent events disclosure and eliminate potential conflict with sec guidance specifically an entity that is an sec filer is no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been 

evaluated this update was effective for us on december 27 2009 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on defining a milestone in regards to revenue recognition and for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate an entity can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all the criteria to be considered substantive determining whether a milestone is substantive is a matter of judgment made at the inception of the arrangement the amendment will be effective for us beginning in fiscal 2011 and it will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we entered into a 7500 million credit agreement dated august 26 2010 our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility in the 7500 million credit agreement 

our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 74 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

we issued 3500 million of the 2013 notes in a private placement in the second quarter of 2006 the convertible 2013 notes bear an interest rate of 225 the fair market value of the outstanding notes was approximately 3492 million on december 25 2010 based on their quoted market value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of the revenue from our foreign operations is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies additionally we have exposure on certain intercompany loans we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges 

during 2010 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items including intercompany loans the foreign currency contract outstanding as of december 25 2010 is a nondesignated hedge and is marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services the drug development process requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money—various studies and reports estimate it takes between 1016 years up to 165 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fdaapproved drug charles river is positioned to leverage our core competencies in vivo biology and regulatorycompliant preclinical services in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our customers in bringing their drugs to market faster 

we have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs we provide the research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for over 60 years we have built upon our core competencies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development our customer base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate approximately 70 facilities in 16 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2009 our net sales were 120 billion and our operating income was 1669 million 

in recent years we have completed a number of acquisitions that have broadened our present portfolio of highend services to include general toxicology specialty toxicology discovery and imaging services biopharmaceutical services and phase i clinical services in addition these acquisitions 

• significantly expanded our overall corporate size • significantly increased the breadth of the products and services that we offer and • expanded and strengthened our global footprint in the growing market for pharmaceutical research and development services these acquisitions which include the acquisitions of piedmont research center llc cerebricon ltd and systems pathology company llc in 2009 and newlab bioquality ag and mir preclinical services in 2008 have been critical in our continuing mission to support our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers who are increasingly seeking full service global partners to whom they can outsource more of their preclinical research and development efforts by some estimates the outsourced in vivo discovery and drug development services markets in which we participate—ranging from research model production through phase i clinical services—has a current 

size of approximately 7075 billion annually it is thought that this represents 3040 of all of the related in vivo discovery and drug development work currently performed with wide variances among the different services and in the aggregate is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue 

in 2009 much of our focus was dedicated towards ongoing positioning to take advantage of longterm opportunities to support our clients as they continue to outsource drug development services one element of this focus has manifested through realignments of our pcs organization and our sales and marketing group in 2009 we also pushed forward process efficiency initiatives through strengthening of our lean six sigma organization and at the beginning of fiscal 2010 the initial rollout of our erp enterprise resource planning system in the united states in 2008 we completed the major stages of our threeyear capacity expansion program and in early 2009 we finished with the last few elements of the program with focus on facilities in china and sherbrooke canada we continually evaluate our capacity in light of our customer needs and demands accordingly in january 2010 we announced that we had decided to suspend operations at our shrewsbury massachusetts facility by the middle of 2010 with the intention to resume operations when global preclinical market conditions improve and we require additional capacity for additional discussion of the factors that were elements of our 2009 focus as well as the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k 

research models and services rms charles river has been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with approximately 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in supporting the use of research models in drug development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia japan we maintain production centers including a total of approximately 180 barrier rooms or isolator facilities strategically located near our customers in 2009 rms accounted for 55 of our total net sales and approximately 45 of our employees including approximately 130 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees

research models a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats and mice for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions we have 23 production facilities located in 8 countries worldwide which are strategically located to be in close proximity to our customers our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality associated with the products our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

• outbred which are genetically heterogeneous • inbred which are genetically identical • hybrid which are the offspring of two different inbred parents • spontaneous mutant which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and • other genetically modified research models including knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic animals we also offer proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research cardiovascular metabolic renal oncology and central nervous system which provides overlapping disease modalities that support multiple uses of certain models 

in addition to our small research models we also are a premier provider of highquality purposebred specific pathogenfree spf large research models to the biomedical research community 

research model services rms also offers a variety of services described below designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates faster these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models as well as those services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the customers drug evaluation process we currently offer four major categories of research models services—genetically engineered models and services consulting and staffing services research animal diagnostic services and discovery and imaging services 

genetically engineered models and services gems in this area of our business we assist our customers in breeding maintenance and performing health profile diagnostics of research models purchased or purposefully created by our customers for biomedical research activities while the creation of a genetically engineered model gem can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise we provide breeding expertise and colony development quarantine and health monitoring germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation including assisted reproduction and genetic monitoring we provide these services to over 500 laboratories and customers around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities 

consulting and staffing services building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage research model care operations including recruitment training staffing and management services on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers demand for our services has been driven by the trend for research institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to their core scientific innovation process or for which they do not maintain the necessary resources inhouse in addition we believe that our expertise in research model care and facility operations enhances the productivity and quality of our customers research model programs 

research animal diagnostic services we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities 

we believe that the continued growth in model development and characterization and utilization of specific disease models and gems will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for health and genetic testing of laboratory research models 

discovery and imaging services augmenting our traditional model production and gems described above we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our customers in a variety of discovery research development and imaging areas expediting the development process of investigational agents by providing products and services to customers extends their internal capabilities complements their internal expertise and helps reduce product development timelines in addition our in vivo biology expertise positions us to provide complementary disease model services which include surgical procedures preconditioning and aging we augmented our discovery and research and development capabilities substantially in 2009 via the acquisitions of piedmont research center focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies in oncology and other therapeutic areas and cerebricon ltd focusing on therapeutic efficacy studies for the evaluation of investigational agents for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system in addition our 2008 acquisition of mir preclinical services allows us to offer extensive in vivo imaging capabilities in disease models including mri pet ct and bioluminescencefluorescence imaging as well as therapeutic efficacy expertise in inflammation metabolic cardiovascular and oncologic pharmacology imaging services have the potential to increase the efficiency of lead candidate selection by providing earlier and more highly predictive preclinical data compared with traditional nonimaging methods and in addition is well suited to facilitating translation between preclinical testing and clinical evaluation of investigational agents the discovery and imaging services that we offer through our rms business are complementary to the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business 

other related research model products and services we also offer two other categories of products and services within rms— in vitro products and avian vaccine services 

in vitro our in vitro business provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination we are committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible and toward that goal we work with and support the european center for validation of alternative methods in these efforts endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and most successful fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test to date the process of extracting blood is generally not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our in vitro business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services which are used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured 

our growth in the in vitro business is driven by our fda approved line of next generation endotoxin testing products which are based on the endosafe portable testing system endosafe®pts™ technology that allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment we have recently expanded the pts product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the endosafemcs multi cartridge system in response to the demand of our higher testing volume customers we anticipate continued adoption of rapid methods as our customers respond to the fdas process analytical technology pat initiative we also expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in nontraditional areas such as renal dialysis nuclear and compounding pharmacies and cellular therapy in addition we are currently exploring obtaining 510k medical device approval of this technology for clinical diagnostic applications 

avian vaccine services we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is performed under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence in north america with several spf egg production facilities in the united states and contracted production capabilities in hungary and franchise operations in india and australia we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

preclinical services pcs our pcs customers are principally engaged in the discovery and development of new drugs devices and therapies 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically last anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development activities which follow and which can take up to 7 years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials with our focus on earlystage drug development support we view clinical phase i firstinhuman assessment studies as a strategic component of our preclinical service offerings 

the development services portion of our pcs business enables our customers to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired drug and toxicology activities to us the demand for these services was historically driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of larger global pharmaceutical companies the necessary significant investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently conduct these activities means that global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are frequently choosing to outsource their development activities allowing them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and particularly for pharmaceutical companies promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of general and specialty toxicology studies especially those dealing with innovative therapies and biologicals we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada europe and asia china our pcs segment represented 45 of our total net sales in 2009 and employed 51 of our employees including approximately 375 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

we currently offer the following preclinical services in which we include both in vivo and in vitro studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development from inception to proof of concept 

toxicology toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected appropriate toxicology studies are conducted to support clinical trials in humans these studies are performed in laboratory models to elucidate the potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods and focus on safety and assessment of harmful effects our toxicology services feature 

• all the standard protocols for general toxicity testing genotoxicity safety pharmacology acute subacute chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity bioassays required for regulatory submissions supporting firstinhuman to firsttothemarket strategies 6 

• expertise in specialty routes of administration and modes of administration eg infusion intravitreal intrathecal and inhalation which are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals but also for the safety testing of medical devices industrial chemicals food additives agrochemicals biocides nutraceuticals animal health products and other materials • marketleading expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in support of larger scale human clinical trials • services in important specialty areas such as ocular bone juvenileneonatal immunotoxicity photobiology and dermal testing • work in all major therapeutic areas • study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience and scientific expertise in support of drug development and • a strong history of assisting our clients in achieving their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing including studies addressing stem cell therapies dna vaccines protein biotherapeutics small molecules and medical devices our toxicology facilities operate in compliance with good laboratory practices glps as required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other glp compliance monitoring authorities as well as our own and our customers quality assurance departments 

pathology services in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic change is critical in determining the safety of a new compound we employ a large number of highly trained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential test articlerelated changes within tissues fluids and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical not only for regulatorydriven safety studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key gonogo decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our customers are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated analytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes after performing sample analysis for preclinical study support we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites by radiolabeled techniques pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied to higher doses that may result in adverse effects our clients require these studies for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug the results of which are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

discovery support at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the activity and efficacy of drug candidates in several important therapeutic areas including 

• asthma through our specialized disease model colonies • bone disease using our stateoftheart imaging and pathology capabilities • ophthalmology using our models of neovascularization • general cardiovascular and device testing using our surgical models and • early drug formulation and bioanalysis support and method development we also offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business are complementary to the discovery and imaging services that we offer through our rms business 

biopharmaceutical services 

we provide specialized testing of biologicals and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology developers our laboratories in the united states germany scotland and ireland provide timely compliant molecular biology virology bioanalytical immunochemistry microbiology and related services we confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this testing is required by the fda and other global regulatory authorities for our customers to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we also collaborate with clients on process development validation and manufacturing scaleup 

phase i trials in healthy normal and special populations 

phase i clinical trials are usually short duration studies conducted on a small number 20100 of healthy human subjects although special populations can be used under highly controlled conditions testing is usually performed where trial participants can be closely monitored in a secure environment such as at a clinictype facility or hospital 

our clinical services capabilities are located at our premier phase i clinic in tacoma washington with a capacity of 250 beds we focus our clinical services business on highend clinical pharmacology studies in healthy participants from a strategic perspective we believe that our business benefits from complementary and consecutive services offerings of preclinical services and phase i clinical research in our core earlystage development portfolio 

we offer a wide range of phase i clinical research services designed to move lead pharmaceutical candidates rapidly from preclinical development through phase i pharmacokinetic tolerability and pharmacodynamic assessment to explore human pharmacology we can conduct studies across a wide range of therapeutic areas and have demonstrated experience in complex dose tolerance radiolabeled cardiac safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and bioavailability studies in addition we provide customers with highend firstinhuman studies for novel compounds and expertise in complex drugdrug interaction studies 

participants at our clinics are evaluated through an intensive screening process to ensure study suitability we employ clinical regulatory compliance staff to monitor the conduct and reporting of phase i trials and to assure management that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients in accelerating the search for drugs devices and therapies from in vivo discovery through firstinhuman testing our goal is to deliver a full portfolio of products and services for drug discovery and development and to partner with our clients by providing the greatest value and strategic benefit our business is primarily driven by the trend towards virtualization of and increase in outsourced services by our customers along with the continued growth of research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the federal government and academic institutions 

outsourcing allows our customers to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on early drug discovery and for more mature companies marketing while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours who can help optimize our clients programs and assist in accelerating their drug discovery and development process our strategy is to capitalize on these opportunities by continuing to build our portfolio of premium valueadded products and services through internal development and investment augmented by strategic bolton transactions 

charles river is positioned to address our customers future needs and improve the efficiency and speed of their drug development activities as we provide a multifaceted value proposition that enables us to 

• provide external expertise which may be too costly for our customers to build andor maintain inhouse • partner with customers to allow them to compensate for recent capacity andor staff reductions • provide flexible arrangements to better balance our clients workloadstaff requirements often reducing their personnel and operating costs • provide customized solutions across therapeutic area • draw upon our higher utilization and efficiencies to our clients advantage including the use of purposebuilt facilities designed for high throughput • address our customers demands for noncore but strategically important in vivo biology activities and specialty services such as general and specialty toxicology and program management that are prohibitive for customers to maintain inhouse and • provide additional value to our customers through broadbased partnerships across the breadth of the charles river portfolio in todays business environment we believe there is a particular advantage in being a global full service highquality provider of services throughout the drug discovery and development continuum many of our customers especially large pharmaceutical companies are attracted to tier 1 contract research organizations with a full breadth of capabilities and choose to establish preferred provider relationships with only a small number which allows them to simplify their relationship management as well as access greater value from their outsourcing partner recent trends suggest that large pharmaceutical restructurings with increased focus on key therapeutic areas may favor larger contract research organizations who can present customers with the benefits of economies of scale and scope extensive therapeutic area expertise global footprint and simplified communications and coordination those companies with critical mass and financial stability are likely to have an advantage as we expect that customers will gravitate towards placing longterm studies with providers they can rely upon we are focused on being recognized as a premier preferred provider and building broader and deeper longterm strategic partnerships with our customers accordingly with many of our largest customers we enter into global preferred provider agreements that span both segments of our business in addition in response to individual customer needs we remain flexible and open to broadbased multiyear partnering arrangements which may take various and customized forms historically these 

generally involve financial commitments from the customer which tap into the broad array of physical andor service resources that we provide eg reserving dedicated space within existing facilities building out space to a particular specification working within our clients infrastructure and occasionally establishing a new facility 

this strategy and focus has been developed in recognition of the needs and desires of our customers who are increasingly facing pressure to manage their research and development costs while at the same time maintaining or developing a strong pipeline of innovative new drugs conduct research and development in multiple countries simultaneously and identify hire and retain a breadth of scientific and technical experts it is both risky and expensive to bring a new prescription drug to market it is estimated that only 4 in 5000  10000 investigational drugs that begin preclinical testing will progress to human testing and only one of those will be approved for human use according to various reports it takes 10 to 16 years and costs in the range of 180 million to 165 billion with an average cost of over 900 million to bring a new drug to market 12 billion for a biologic furthermore costs associated with developing new drugs and biologics are increasing due to a variety of factors including 

• price inflation • fast moving technological advances highthroughput screening combinatorial chemistry genomics proteomics which have increased the investment costs to conduct research and development • increased challenges in addressing unmet needs eg chronic diseases • increased costs and extended timelines due to the difficulty in conducting trials in western countries and • increasing clinical trial complexity size and extended timelines due to increased requirements to demonstrate efficacy safety and cost effectiveness in order to convert largely fixed costs into variable expenses and to facilitate and speed their research our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are making strategic decisions to outsource a portfolio of services to highquality full service providers like us during the past decade we believe that the growth of outsourcing by our customers has been driven by a unique confluence of events including 

• the current outlook for drugs coming off patent protection and resulting threats from generic drug manufacturers which are expected to affect a large percentage of these companies existing revenues in the intermediate future • the reduction over the past decade in the growth rate of drugs gaining approval • increased pressure 1 to find drugs to cure and manage chronic diseases many of which are complex and affect small andor aging patient populations and 2 to develop specialty and orphan drugs in both cases increasing risk and cost of development while segmenting and shrinking the patient populations from blockbusters to smaller more specialized indications • continued productivity and cost containment pressures on the medical device diagnostics and biopharmaceutical industries due in part to escalating global healthcare costs increasing concentration of buying power attributable to larger payors and governments while customers in those fields simultaneously need to manage increased financial focus on operating margins and returns • increasing globalization of drug development particularly increased research and development activity in developing countries 10 

• heightened regulatory authority scrutiny worldwide particularly concerning drug safety and • scrutiny of the medical value of new drugs being developed as compared to established therapies over the most recent couple of years our customers have faced a more challenging market environment among the factors that have affected them we have seen the following have the most material impact and negatively affect outsourcing trends 

• large pharmaceutical companies have intensified their costsavings and efficiency actions and have announced significant initiatives to improve their research and development productivity and rationalize their drug pipelines this focus has been manifested through consolidation and reductions in infrastructure spending constraints pricing pressures and project delays and cancellations in the short term we have seen large pharmaceutical companies slow down their early stage preclinical and phase i studies in favor of their laterstage products as they reprioritize compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate • biotechnology customers particularly those that are cashflow negative have been highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment • sponsor consolidation particularly several large and midsized biopharmaceutical company mergers • many customers are narrowing their pipeline focus to a smaller number of similar highpotential therapeutic areas where they may yield the greatest returns with particular focus and competition in oncology metabolismobesity autoimmuneinflammatory central nervous system and infectious disease • many larger customers have diversified their technology platform bases and have extended their portfolios into biologics therapeutic proteins antibodies rnai and vaccines while retaining their core expertise in small molecules • our customers generally have been focused on nearterm cost controls as they contend with the challenges of the global economic meltdown and • senior management turnover and structural realignment has resulted in some internal turmoil and slower decisionmaking in some of our larger customers while they finalize and rollout their restructuring plans while the shortterm consequences of these factors have temporarily mitigated the outsourcing growth rate trends we believe that in the midterm there is no fundamental change in our clients drug development activities and strategies and in fact these changes will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities going forward in fact we remain optimistic that with the closing of the major mergers in 2009 and the stabilization of other of the factors addressed above the pharmaceutical industry will return to focusing on driving drugs and therapies through the development pipeline also we believe that as larger pharmaceutical companies become leaner and more efficient generally focusing on their core competencies of fundamental research and development and commercialization they will also continue to be conservative in their staffing and further reduce their inhouse expertise this should lead to reinvigoration of outsourcing as they assess their key internal priorities 

in 2009 we moderated our investment in capacity expansion in light of the heavy investments we made from 2006 through 2008 nonetheless the combination of reduced customer demand cost containment initiatives pursued by our customers and excess capacity within our industry generally has resulted in significant pricing pressure in 2009 and into 2010 in response we have taken a number of steps to better support our customers in todays challenging environment identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction improve operating efficiencies and generally strengthen our business model 

first in the past year we closed or disposed of smaller less efficient sites including pcs arkansas and our phase i facility in scotland as well as two small rms sites in hungary and belgium and reduced headcount by about 1000 primarily throughout our pcs segment this includes our recent decision to suspend operations at our pcs massachusetts site in light of our completed facility expansions our leaner infrastructure is intended to improve our operating margins while providing us with sufficient capacity and flexibility to accommodate increased demand in the future 

second we announced two internal organizational restructurings that affect our pcs business and our sales and marketing organization 

pcs organizational realignment we restructured our preclinical services business to create a dual accountability structure with both global functional teams and sitelevel management this new structure centralizes and integrates our global pcs portfolio and unites expertise from various facilities to support our client programs regardless of the specific site at which the program was initiated this structure allows team members to easily share information and best practices globally standardize operations and improve efficiencies throughout charles river most importantly it further enables us to provide exceptional and consistent service at all levels and across all sites worldwide which is particularly important to those clients who utilize multiple charles river sites 

sales and marketing realignment we realigned our enterprisewide sales and marketing team with changes fully implemented at the beginning of 2010 this enhances our clientcentric focus and communications by segment through the establishment of a threepronged sales organization with a focus on global biopharmaceutical companies small and midsized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and academic and government customers 

we have designated dedicated sales professionals for each segment enhancing our ability to meet customer needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio overall this reorganization will allow us to provide more comprehensive coverage and support for all of the market segments among our diverse client population 

finally we have also remained focused on internal process improvement initiatives specifically we have continued our investment in our information technology systems and resources in order to better serve our customers harmonize our data and streamline our processes our most visible effort has been the initial roll out of our integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the first stage which included all of our united states sites as well as our rms site in canada went live at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and other locations are expected to be added in later stages in addition we have continued to expand our lean six sigma program to reduce process cycle times eliminate nonvalue add steps and optimize our operating efficiencies based on the initial success of the program in our pcs business segment we have recently expanded it to rms to attain similar operational benefits and elevated the program director to a corporate vice president level 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug development continuum primarily through internal development which will be augmented as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing stockholder value this strategy may include geographic expansion of existing core services strengthening of one of our core services or the addition of a new product or service in a related or adjacent business in 2009 we completed 4 acquisitions ranging in size from 54 million to 456 million 

we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities as strategic outsourcing by our customers increases we believe that our expertise in areas previously addressed by our customers inhouse capabilities allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them in short because these products and services are the core of our business we are able to build and maintain expertise and tap into economies of scale that are difficult for our customers to match within their internal infrastructure 

in addition as our customers narrow their focus toward specific therapeutic areas we have increasingly aligned our services portfolio along therapeutic lines particularly those subject to major research funding or focus such as oncology metabolism and obesity autoimmuneinflammation cardiovascular infectious disease and central nervous system we have also focused on adding expertise in the biologics development areas as a result of these collective efforts we expect to be better positioned to gain market share by taking advantage of these trends as well as broader based collaboration across the in vivo discovery to firstinhuman continuum 

customers 

in 2010 we established a threepronged sales organization with a focus on 

• global biopharmaceutical companies • small and midsized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and • academic and government customers our customers continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies animal health medical device diagnostic and other life sciences companies and leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our customers during 2009 no single commercial customer accounted for more than 6 of our total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 10 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 10 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

as part of our recent sales organization realignment we have designated dedicated sales people for each our three customer segments enhancing our ability to meet customer needs by offering customized tailored solutions across our entire portfolio in addition our midmarket pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers will benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise this allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams the majority of whom work in north america with the balance in europe and the asiapacific countries our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers and newsletters making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internetbased marketing advertising and direct mail in certain locales our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents for our products and services particularly with respect to our in vitro and biopharmaceutical services businesses 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we maintain clientcustomer service technical assistance and consulting service departments which address both our customers routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for our clients we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical and clinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our customers 

our marketing efforts are focused to stimulate demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of in vivo biology are increasingly attractive to our customers and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs 

competition 

our strategy is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation responsiveness pricing innovation breadth of therapeutic and scientific expertise timeliness and availability supported by our professional bench strength in in vivo biology and toxicology global capabilities and strategically located facilities worldwide we are able to offer a unique portfolio to support most of the drug development continuum through our wide range of research models and research model services discovery and imaging services and our broad array of both routine and specialized preclinical services through firstinhuman phase i clinical services 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

• for rms our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america each of whom has a global scope and several smaller competitors in europe and in japan of our main us competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our main competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships • as for pcs we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world based on net service revenue our commercial competitors for preclinical services consist of both publicly held and privately owned companies and it is estimated that the top five participants including charles river account for approximately 50 of the global market exclusive of clinical services with the rest of the market remaining highly fragmented our pcs segment including our phase i business also competes with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies universities and teaching hospitals we believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glpcompliant practices 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the 

benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 26 2009 we had approximately 8000 employees including approximately 500 professionals with advanced degrees including phds dvms and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our satisfaction surveys indicate that we have an excellent relationship with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment was 2737 million at december 26 2009 as compared to 3107 million at december 27 2008 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a customers intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2009 backlog may be completed in 2010 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments as described below 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs aaalac covers all species of laboratory animals including rats mice and birds our preclinical business is also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical laboratory safety studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients products throughout the world a minor part of our rms business also conducts similar studies for our clients the conduct of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada state food and drug administration of the peoples republic of china and the japanese ministry of health and welfare glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our pcs business also conducts human phase i clinical trials and provides services in support of our clients registration or licensing applications human clinical trials are conducted in a progressive fashion beginning with phase i and in the case of approved drugs continued through phase iv trials phase i studies are the initial human clinical trials and are conducted with a small number of subjects under highly controlled conditions these clinical trials and services are performed in accordance with the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practice consolidated guidance and in compliance with regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human clinical trial subjects fda regulations do not require a quality assurance program however our phase i facility has an established quality assurance unit that monitors the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing businesses produces endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective good manufacturing practice gmp regulations we are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to gmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities we also maintain an establishment license with usdas center for veterinary biologics cvb that covers certain of our sites which manufacture antigens used in a licensed diagnostic kit for rodents or—particular to our avian vaccine services—which manufacture usda licensed antigens antibodies and viruses that are sold to clients for use in the manufacturing of their own usda licensed products our vaccine support business also manufactures and markets three usda licensed products that are considered final use products mycoplasma gallisepticum antigen mycoplasma melegridis antigen and mycoplasma synoviae antigen and sites involved in the manufacture of these articles are subject to regular inspection by usdacvb 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we have established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all quality assurance functions within the company headed by our corporate vice president for regulatory affairs and compliance 

intellectual property 

we develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and through registration of title or use in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services business in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhancing our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our in vitro testing business including the endosafepts and our pathology based software development activities through our systems pathology company subsidiary we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of the products or services we offer are dependent

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

  set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past decade our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development a decrease in preclinical andor clinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in fact in 2009 our revenues for our pcs segment declined 206 from 2008 for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k furthermore our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on compounds in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources of our biotechnology customers particularly those that are cashnegative who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets although funds disbursed through the american recovery and reinvestment act could provide some offset similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including funding for biotechnology companies which have suffered during the 20082009 economic downturn also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the research and development budgets at our pharmaceutical customers have recently slowed down their preclinical and phase i studies in favor of their laterstage products as they reprioritize compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate furthermore our customers particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue to search for ways to maintain the breadth of their compound 

pipeline but with leaner research and development costs per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities although the obama administrations stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years and a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results also there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the united states strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in recent years the us congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any nor in what form they may ultimately be approved similar reform movements have occurred in europe and asia 

implementation of health care reform legislation that contains costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our customers may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

our standard customer agreements contain customerdetermined termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including 

• the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements • unexpected or undesired study results • production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested • the customers decision to forego or terminate a particular study • the loss of funding for the particular research study or • for general conveniencecustomer preference if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business particularly our pcs segment and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may underprice or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the customer the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costsexpenses 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventitious infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales contaminations also expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our customers facilities with similar impact to 

them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in man and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf our total net sales in recent years we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

• foreign currencies we receive for sales and which we record as expenses outside the united states could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue and increase the amount of expenses that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results • certain contracts particularly in canada are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations • general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate • potential international conflicts including terrorist acts • potential trade restrictions exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states • difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of violations of local laws or the us foreign corrupt practices act by employees overseas or the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements • the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations • unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of us and foreign tax laws • longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and • import and export licensing requirements upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

we recently completed the initial implementation of a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system the first stage which included all of our united states sites as well as our rms site in canada went live at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and other locations are expected to be added in later stages the process of planning and preparing for such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including 

data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention impacting the industry this has included onsite demonstrations near facilities operated by us any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large research models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import lawsrestrictions or embargoes international trade regulations foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from participants in connection with a particular phase i clinical trial the data collected from that trial could be disqualified and we might be required to redo the trial at no further cost to our customer but at substantial cost to us furthermore the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably there has been a recent updating of guidance in europe that will be implemented over a period of several years on a countrybycountry basis because of the complexities of the formal adoption process the finalization and implementation of this guidance will likely take three or more years similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation euthanasia guidance import and export requirements of biological materials health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants in the united states an updating of guidance used by the national institutes of health and by certain oversight agencies for the care and use of laboratory animals has been completed and it is expected to be finalized and implemented over the next two years these new guidelines could cause us increased costs attributable to additional facilities the need to add personnel to address new processes as well as increased administrative burden and the upgrading of existing facilities 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for our services we compete on a variety of factors including 

• reputation for ontime quality performance • reputation for regulatory compliance • expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas • scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum • broad geographic availability with consistent quality • pricevalue • technological expertise and efficient drug development processes • quality of facilities • financial stability • size • ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner and • ability to manage phase i clinical trials if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies although recent trends in 2008 and 2009 also demonstrated increased merger activity between larger pharmaceutical companies themselves if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and contract research organizations generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities in acquiring and rolling up these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore in recent years both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area have been investing in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing capacity growth and market demand if capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects may occur these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results 

potential changes in us tax law 

on february 1 2010 president obama and the us treasury department proposed changing certain of the us tax rules for us corporations doing business outside the united states the proposed changes include limiting the ability of us corporations to deduct interest expense allocated and apportioned to offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and further restricting the ability of us corporations to transfer funds between foreign subsidiaries without triggering us income tax although the scope of the proposed changes remains unclear and the likelihood of 

enactment is uncertain it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase the companys effective tax rate which would affect our profitability 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from enhanced deductions and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or deductions would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits cash flow and our effective tax rate 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 26 2009 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 6685 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

• errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical or phase i clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing • litigation risk including resulting from our errors or omissions associated with the possibility that the drugscompounds of our clients that were included in drug development trials we participated in may cause illness personal injury or have other negative side effects to clinical study participants or other persons including death • general risks associated with operating a phase i clinical business including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers • risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers property such as research models and samples study compounds records work in progress other archived materials or goods and materials in transit while in our possession • risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals 24 

• risk that we may have errors and omissions related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs primarily through our in vitro business or in the testing of biologicals and other services performed by our biopharmaceutical services business which could result in us or our customers failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials and • errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections 

in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients investigators and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to attract suitable participants for our phase i clinical trials our business might suffer 

the phase i clinical research studies we run rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of subjects participants generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted which such communities to date have provided a substantial pool of potential subjects for research studies our phase i clinical research activities could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing participants on a consistent basis 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging technology could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method or other method that reduces the need for animal research models as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets for instance we acquired imaging capabilities in 2008 through our acquisition of mir and further augmented our imaging services in 2009 through the acquisition of cerebricon however we generally may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales in addition other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce and which may be viewed as more desirable by our customers 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services 

we may seek to develop and market new services that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings if we are unable to develop new services andor create demand for those newly developed services our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 26 2009 we had approximately 4926 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 4 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

during the past decade we have expanded our business through numerous acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products or technologies • challenges with developing and operating new businesses including diversion of managements attention from other business concerns • potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller • acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders • loss of key employees of the acquired companies • risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies 26 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies and • difficulties in achieving business and financial success in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of customer data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical and the clinical studies we conduct for our customers unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our customers typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for over 30 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our management if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

• changes in the general global economy • the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements • the commencement postponement progress completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter • changes in the mix of our products and services • the extent of cost overruns • holiday patterns of our customers • budget cycles of our customers 27 

• the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events and • exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following managements discussion and analysis will help you understand the financial condition and results of operations the managements discussion and analysis is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently our broad portfolio of products and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed to market and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of regulatory compliant preclinical services which address drug discovery and development in the preclinical arena we have been in business for over 60 years and currently operate approximately 70 facilities in 16 countries worldwide 

this was a challenging year for preclinical services we believe business restructuring and reprioritization of pipelines by pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients in 2008 and early 2009 contributed towards reduced demand as we started the year as 2009 progressed our operating results were further negatively impacted by an assortment of factors including continued measured spending by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due to the impact of the slower economy and world wide credit crisis a period of accelerating consolidations significant study slippage and delays in customer decisions and commitments tight cost constraints and recognition of excess preclinical capacity within our industry which resulted in pricing pressure a focus on latestage human testing as customers endeavor to bring drugs to market and pending healthcare reform initiatives all of these factors contributed to demand uncertainty and impacted sales in 2009 as we look forward we anticipate market demand particularly for preclinical services will begin to ramp up slowly beginning in the second quarter of 2010 as our customers reinvigorate their drug development efforts and continue to employ methods to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of their drug development pipelines as well as complete consolidations that have been announced we believe they will increase their focus on strategic outsourcing which will drive demand for the services we provide 

we believe that the longterm drivers for our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our customers continued demand for research models and services and regulatory compliant preclinical services which are essential to the drug development process we will also continue to pursue strategic bolton acquisitions that complement our business increase the rate of our growth or geographically expand our existing services as evidenced by our acquisitions of systems pathology company cerebricon and piedmont research center in 2009 

during this period of market uncertainty we continue to align our organization to support market requirements the actions we implemented in 2009 included restrictions on hiring a salary freeze for a substantial percentage of our workforce including almost all incentiveeligible employees since lifted in 2010 continued tight control of discretionary spending headcount reductions predominately in our preclinical services pcs business segment reduction in targeted bonus amounts and other benefits and the closure of our arkansas facility as a result of these actions we recorded a charge for severance costs of 166 million additionally during 2009 we realigned our pcs organization as well as our sales and marketing team to enhance our customer service and client focus during 2010 and into the future we are continuing our process improvement initiatives including the ongoing roll out of our erp system and lean six sigma program to drive further efficiencies in our organization 

we have evaluated our capacity plans for our pcs business taking into consideration the factors that are affecting our sales and determined that we have more than sufficient capacity to accommodate our clients current demand accordingly we will suspend operations at our pcs facility in shrewsbury massachusetts during 2010 we intend to resume operations when global preclinical market conditions improve and we require additional capacity in light of our completed facility expansions our leaner infrastructure is intended to improve our operating margins while providing us with sufficient capacity and flexibility to accommodate increased demand in the future as a result of this decision the company expects to record charges of approximately 7 million primarily in the first quarter of 2010 for severance and related costs we expect in total these actions have reduced costs by approximately 40 million in 2009 and 70 million in 2010 

total net sales in 2009 were 12 billion a decrease of 105 from 2008 the sales decrease was due primarily to slower demand for pcs due to significant study slippage and delays in customer decisions and commitments lack of capital market funding for biotechnology companies our clients tight cost controls which resulted in more measured spending and pricing pressure and a focus on latestage human testing as customers endeavor to bring drugs to market the effect of foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales of 23 our gross margin decreased to 357 of net sales compared to 380 of net sales in 2008 due primarily to lower sales 

our operating income for 2009 was 1669 million compared to a loss for 2008 of 4499 million primarily due to our goodwill impairment of 700 million in 2008 income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners was 1112 million in 2009 compared to a loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners of 5249 million in 2008 diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2009 was 169 compared to a loss per share of 780 in 2008 our capital expenditures totaled 800 million for 2009 compared to 1999 million for 2008 our planned capital expenditures in 2010 are in the range of 60 million to 70 million net income attributable to common shareowners for 2009 was 1144 million compared to loss attributable to common shareowners for 2008 of 5245 million 

we report two segments rms and pcs which reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed 

our rms segment which represented 549 of net sales in 2009 includes sales of research models genetically engineered models and services gems research animal diagnostics rads discovery and imaging services consulting and staffing services vaccine support and in vitro business net sales for this segment were flat compared to 2008 with unfavorable foreign currency translation of 13 partially offset by the addition of piedmont research center cerebricon and mir preclinical services we experienced decreases in both the rms gross margin from 431 to 422 and operating margin from 301 to 293 compared to last year due mainly to the impact of our fixed costs with flat sales partially offset by cost savings 

our pcs segment which represented 451 of net sales in 2009 includes services required to take a drug through the development process including discovery support toxicology pathology biopharmaceutical bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services as well as phase i clinical trials sales for this segment decreased 206 over 2008 driven by slower demand for preclinical services and unfavorable foreign currency which decreased sales growth by 32 partially offset by the fullyear impact of newlab bioquality ag which we acquired in september of 2008 we experienced a decrease in the pcs gross margin from 331 in 2008 to 278 in 2009 due mainly to lower capacity utilization due to the lower sales volume increased pricing pressure and costs associated with the start up of our new facilities in china and canada partially offset by expense management as a result of our goodwill impairment the 2008 operating margin was a negative 873 compared to 68 in 2009 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets 

liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

we consider the following accounting estimates important in understanding our operating results and financial condition for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements—note 1 significant accounting policies  

valuation and impairment of goodwill other intangible assets and other longlived assets 

valuation of certain longlived assets including property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such as the income approach and the cost approach as appropriate in establishing the fair value of longlived assets typically key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 

we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on internal projections key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned 

to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including customer relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our assessment step one for 2009 the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 26 2009 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 6685 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008 based on our initial assessment step one the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired as economic conditions worsened late in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated coupled with a decrease in our market capitalization management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment test as of december 27 2008 our analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 700 million 

for intangible assets goodwill and property plant and equipment we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

• significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results • significant negative industry or economic trends or • significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our longlived assets should we determine that the carrying value of longlived tangible assets may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets as appropriate significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue related to our products which include research models in vitro technology and vaccine support products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally in the form of customer purchase orders title and risk of loss have transferred which occurs upon delivery of the products the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured these recognition criteria are met at the time the product is delivered to the customers site product sales are recorded net of returns upon delivery for large models in some cases customers pay in advance of delivery of the product these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product 

our service revenue is comprised of toxicology pathology laboratory clinical phase i trials gems and consulting and staffing services and is generally evidenced by customer contracts toxicology services provide highly specialized studies to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new pharmaceutical compounds and materials used in medical devices pathology services provide the ability to identify and characterize pathologic changes within tissues and cells in determining the safety of a new compound laboratory services monitor and analyze the health and genetics of research models used in research protocols clinical phase i conducts tolerability assessments to explore human pharmacology gems services include validating maintaining breeding and testing research models for biomedical research activities consulting and staffing services provide management of animal care operations on behalf of government academic pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations 

the toxicology pathology and clinical phase i trials services arrangements typically range from one to six months but can range up to approximately 24 months in length these agreements are negotiated for a fixed fee laboratory service arrangements are generally completed within a onemonth period and are also of a fixed fee nature gems and consulting and staffing services are of a longerterm nature from six months to five years and are billed at agreed upon rates as specified in the contract 

our service revenue is recognized upon the completion of the agreed upon performance criteria these performance criteria are generally in the form of either study protocols or specified activities or procedures which we are engaged to perform these performance criteria are established by our customers and do not contain acceptance provisions which are based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based upon rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to estimated costs to complete procedures specified by customers in the form of study protocols in general such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules but are recognized as revenue as services are performed as a result of the reviews revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known 

deferred and unbilled revenue are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the customer with the offset to unbilled receivable as of december 26 2009 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 326 million and deferred revenue of 724 million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts 

pension plan accounting 

our defined benefit pension plans assets liabilities and expenses are calculated by accredited independent actuaries using certain assumptions which are approved by management the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 26 2009 the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans was 541 as of december 26 2009 we had a pension liability of 326 million 

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the 

asset allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 18 million 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period during the year ended december 26 2009 we recognized 238 million of stock compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock and performance based stock awards we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straightline basis over the vesting periods of the awards net of estimated forfeitures forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility expected term expected dividends and riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated on at least an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future we may need to increase or decrease income tax expense which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

as of december 26 2009 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 278 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us federal and state taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our tax provision is based upon enacted tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

effective december 31 2006 we adopted a new accounting standard for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements the guidance also provides for the derecognition of previously recognized income tax items measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and financial statement disclosure accordingly we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments resolutions of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



segment operations 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling 

general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 



  



in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net sales net sales in 2009 were 12026 million a decrease of 1409 million or 105 from 13435 million in 2008 

research models and services in 2009 net sales for our rms segment were 6599 million flat compared to 2008 sales growth from the additions of piedmont research center mir preclinical services and cerebricon was offset by softer demand for products and services a 13 negative impact from foreign currency translation and the divestiture of the vaccine business in mexico 

preclinical services in 2009 net sales for our pcs segment were 5426 million a decrease of 1410 million or 206 compared to 6836 million in 2008 the decrease in pcs sales was primarily due to slower demand for preclinical services and unfavorable foreign currency which decreased sales growth by 32 and the divestiture of the phase i business in scotland partially offset by full year impact of the acquisition of newlab 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2009 was 7732 million a decrease of 596 million or 72 from 8328 million in 2008 cost of products sold and services provided in 2009 was 643 of net sales compared to 620 in 2008 

research models and services cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2009 was 3813 million an increase of 60 million or 16 compared to 3753 million in 2008 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was 578 compared to 569 in 2008 the increase in cost as a percentage of sales was due to the impact of increased fixed costs with flat sales 

preclinical services cost of services provided for the pcs segment in 2009 was 3919 million a decrease of 656 million or 143 compared to 4575 million in 2008 cost of services provided as a percentage of net sales was 722 in 2009 compared to 669 in 2008 the increase in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower capacity utilization additional costs associated with the start up of the new preclinical facilities in sherbrooke and china and severance costs partially offset by cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 were 2340 million an increase of 37 million or 16 from 2303 million in 2008 selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 were 195 of net sales compared to 171 of net sales in 2008 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was primarily due to the lower sales 

research models and services selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2009 were 790 million a decrease of 43 million or 52 compared to 833 in 2008 selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to 120 in 2009 from 126 in 2008 due mainly to tight control of discretionary costs and lower operating expenses in japan 

preclinical services selling general and administrative expenses for the pcs segment in 2009 were 915 million a decrease of 33 million or 36 compared to 948 million in 2008 due mainly to tight control of discretionary costs lower bonus expense and a gain on the sale of real estate selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 increased to 168 of net sales compared 139 in 2008 due mainly to lower sales

stockbased compensation information systems compliance and facilities expenses associated with our corporate administration and professional services functions was 635 million in 2009 compared to 522 million in 2008 the increase in unallocated corporate overhead during 2009 was due primarily to severance charges related to our costsaving actions growth in health care costs increased costs associated with the evaluation of acquisition candidates and the impact of the 2008 pension curtailment gain 

amortization of other intangibles amortization of other intangibles in 2009 was 285 million a decrease of 18 million from 303 million in 2008

goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our initial assessment step one for 2008 the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired as economic conditions worsened late in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated coupled with a decrease in our market capitalization management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment test as of december 27 2008 our analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 700 million

liquidity and capital resources 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations the convertible debt offering our marketable securities and our revolving line of credit arrangements 

we had marketable securities of 726 million and 190 million as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively the increase was due to managements decision to invest in short term investments to increase yield as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 we had 

162 million and 190 million invested in auction rate securities rated aaa by a major credit rating agency our auction rate securities are guaranteed by us federal agencies these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals usually every 7 or 35 days the overall credit concerns in the capital markets as well as the failed auctions of these securities have impacted our ability to liquidate these investments if the auctions for the securities we own continue to fail the investment may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 

in 2006 we issued 3500 million of 225 convertible senior notes the 2013 notes due in 2013 at december 26 2009 the fair value of our outstanding 2013 notes was approximately 3360 based on their quoted market value during the fourth quarter of 2009 no conversion triggers were met concurrently with the sale of the 2013 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our obligation to deliver common stock under the 2013 notes the convertible note hedges give us the right to receive for no additional consideration the numbers of shares of common stock that we are obligated to deliver upon conversion of the 2013 notes subject to antidilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2013 notes and expire on june 15 2013 the aggregate cost of these convertible note hedges was 983 million separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 2013 notes we issued warrants for approximately 72 million shares of our common stock the warrants give the holders the right to receive for no additional consideration cash or shares at our option with a value equal to the appreciation in the price of our shares above 59925 and expire between september 13 2013 and january 22 2014 over 90 equal increments the total proceeds from the issuance of the warrants were 654 million from our economic perspective the cumulative impact of the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants increases the effective conversion price of the 2013 notes from 4894 to 59925 per share 

we currently have a 428 million credit agreement and a 50 million credit agreement at december 26 2009 we had term loans of 1004 million and 900 million under our revolving credit facility under the 428 million credit agreement outstanding as of december 26 2009 we had 1068 million available to borrow under our revolving credit agreements as of december 26 2009 we were compliant with all financial covenants specified in the credit agreements on january 27 2010 we executed our fourth amendment to the 50 million credit agreement to extend the maturity date to july 31 2011 

during 2009 we repatriated 1200 million of the earnings of our nonus subsidiaries pursuant to a plan established in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the repatriation we recorded tax benefits primarily due to foreign tax credits in 2008 of 72 million of which 40 million was reflected in the effective tax rate and 32 million was reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment account and in 2009 of 35 million of which 11 million was reflected in the effective tax rate and 24 million was reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment account the proceeds from the repatriation were used for general corporate purposes we continue to maintain our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to the remaining unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program originally authorized on july 27 2005 and subsequently amended on october 26 2005 may 9 2006 august 1 2007 and july 24 2008 to acquire up to a total of 6000 million of common stock the program does not have a fixed expiration date in order to facilitate these share repurchases we entered into rule 10b51 purchase plans the last of which was terminated in may 2009 as of december 26 2009 approximately 1448 million remained authorized for share repurchases the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 1826 million at december 26 2009 compared to 2436 million at december 27 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 and 2008 was 2174 million and 2822 million respectively the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower earnings our days sales outstanding dso of 43 days as of december 26 2009 has increased from 40 days at december 27 2008 the increase in our dso was primarily driven by decreased deferred revenue as a result of lower pcs sales volume our dso includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation 

net cash used in investing activities in 2009 and 2008 was 2088 million and 2300 million respectively our capital expenditures in 2009 were 800 million of which 319 million was related to rms and 481 million to pcs for 2010 we project capital expenditures to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by operating activities and existing credit facilities we paid 833 million for acquisitions during 2009 primarily related to our purchase of piedmont research center systems pathology company llc spc and cerebricon 

net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was 810 million and 173 million in 2008 during 2009 we purchased 459 million of treasury stock and repaid debt of 541 million partially offset by proceeds from debt of 180 million during 2008 we purchased 1151 million of treasury stock and repaid 365 million of debt partially offset by proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and warrants of 285 million and proceeds from debt of 1020 million 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 26 2009 are as follows 



the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the conversion features of our 2013 notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements because the conversion features associated with these notes is indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity these instruments are not accounted for as derivatives 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to address the accounting for multipledeliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit specifically this update addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting we will adopt the provision of this update on december 27 2009 the beginning of our fiscal year 2010 the adoption of this update will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements this standard replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to 

direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 1 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or 2 the right to receive benefits from the entity an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the amendments in this standard also require additional disclosures about a reporting entitys involvement in variable interest entities which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements this standard is effective for fiscal years starting after november 15 2009 or january 1 2010 for companies reporting earnings on a calendaryear basis we are evaluating the impact this will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets to improve the information an entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets the effects of a transfer on its financial position financial performance and cash flows and a transferors continuing involvement in transferred financial assets this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 or january 1 2010 for companies reporting earnings on a calendaryear basis the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we have entered into two credit agreements the 428 million credit agreement and the 50 million credit agreement our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility in the credit agreement and in the 50 million credit agreement our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 30 million on a pretax basis the book value of our credit agreements approximates fair value 

we issued 350 million of the 2013 notes in a private placement in the second quarter of 2006 the convertible senior debenture notes bear an interest rate of 225 the fair market value of the outstanding notes was 3360 million on december 26 2009 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of the revenue from our foreign operations is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges 

during 2009 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items there were no foreign exchange contracts open as of december 26 2009

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services the drug development process continues to require the steadily increasing investment of time and money—various studies and reports estimate it takes between 1015 years between 800 million and 1 billion and exploration of more than 10000 drug compounds to produce a single fda approved drug charles river is positioned to leverage our core competencies in laboratory animal medicine and science and regulatorycompliant preclinical services in an efficient and costeffective way to aid our customers in bringing their drugs to market faster 

we currently have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs we provide the animal research models required in research and development of new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for 60 years we have built upon our core competencies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development our customer base includes global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world we currently operate approximately 70 facilities in 17 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research in 2008 our net sales from continuing operations were 134 billion and while we had a net operating loss of 5218 million this included a 7000 million goodwill impairment charge 

in recent years we have completed a number of acquisitions that have broadened our present portfolio of highend services to include general toxicology specialty toxicology discovery and imaging services biopharmaceutical services and phase i clinical services in addition these acquisitions 

• significantly expanded our overall corporate size • significantly increased the breadth of the products and services that we offer and • expanded and strengthened our global footprint in the growing market for pharmaceutical research and development services these acquisitions which include the acquisitions of newlab bioquality ag and mir preclinical services in 2008 have been critical in our continuing mission to support our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers who are increasingly seeking full service global partners to whom they can outsource more of their preclinical research and development efforts by some estimates the outsourced drug development services market is approximately 50 billion annually it is thought that this represents only 2025 of all of the drug development work currently performed and is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue 

in 2008 much of our focus has been dedicated towards our continued positioning of ourselves to take advantage of longterm opportunities to support our clients as they continue to outsource drug development services the major elements of our capacity expansion program which has been underway for three years and included the replacement of two of our larger existing pcs facilities with new stateoftheart facilities are drawing to a close we opened the first of the replacement sites in massachusetts in 2007 and the second in nevada in 2008 in addition we opened a new pcs facility in china in late 2008 which we anticipate will be one of the first glpcompliant facilities in china by the end of the first half of 2009 bolstering our efforts to become the partner of choice for our global pharmaceutical customers as they establish and expand research and development activities in china we expect to open a new pcs facility in sherbrooke canada in the first quarter of 2009 in order to relieve capacity constraints at our montreal facility however as a result of certain market factors which emerged in the second half of 2008 and negatively affected our sales growth we evaluated our expansion plans and determined that we have sufficient capacity to accommodate our clients current demand accordingly we have delayed the expansion of our ohio facility until 2010 when the industry will be better positioned to absorb additional capacity in addition to our pcs capacity expansions in 2008 we opened a new rms facility in maryland in part to support the 10year agreement with the national cancer institute to manage its research model colonies 

research models and services rms charles river has been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with approximately 150 different strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in supporting the use of research models in drug development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia japan we maintain production centers including a total of approximately 180 barrier rooms or isolator facilities strategically located near our customers in 2008 rms accounted for 49 of our total net sales and approximately 41 of our employees including approximately 128 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 other related products and services 

research models a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats mice and other species for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions we have approximately 23 production facilities located in 9 countries worldwide which are strategically located to be in close proximity to our customers our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality in the breeding process our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the animals are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

• outbred animals which are genetically heterogeneous • inbred animals which are genetically identical 3 

• hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents • spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and • other genetically modified research models including knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic animals we also offer proprietary diseasespecific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on four areas of research cardiovascular metabolic renal and oncology which in addition to providing overlapping disease modalities that support multiple uses of certain models also permits us to concentrate on focused sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to our small research models we also are a premier provider of highquality purposebred specific pathogenfree spf or disease free large research models to the biomedical research community principally for use in their drug discovery and development studies 

research model services rms also offers a variety of services described below designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates faster these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services include those which are related to genetically defined research models for inhouse research as well as those services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the customers drug evaluation process we currently offer four major categories of research models services—genetically engineered models and services consulting and staffing services research animal diagnostics and discovery and imaging services 

genetically engineered models and services gems in this area of our business we assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing research models purchased or created by our customers for biomedical research activities while the creation of a genetically engineered model gem can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of gems requires significant additional technical expertise we provide breeding expertise model characterization including genotyping and phenotyping and colony development quarantine embryo cryopreservation embryo transfer and health and genetic monitoring we provide these services to over 500 laboratories around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities and maintain more than 1000 different types of naturally occurring or genetically engineered models for our customers 

consulting and staffing services building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage animal care operations including recruitment training staffing and management services on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers demand for our services results from the growing trend by these research institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to the core scientific innovation process or for which they do not maintain the necessary resources inhouse in addition we believe that our expertise in animal care and facility operations enhances the productivity and quality of our customers animal care and use programs 

research animal diagnostics we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in model development and characterization and utilization of specific disease models and gems will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for health and genetic testing of laboratory animals 

discovery and imaging services augmenting our traditional model production and gems described above we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our customers in a variety of discovery and imaging areas such as by speeding the development process by providing services that prepare models to be used in studies immediately upon arrival at the customers facility rather than requiring time and effort on the part of the customer to prepare the models as a result of our veterinary medicine expertise we are well positioned to provide such services which include surgical procedures feeding and aging and biological and chemical modification in addition through our acquisition of mir preclinical services we now offer extensive in vivo imaging capabilities as well as expertise in oncology and inflammation pharmacology the discovery and imaging services that we offer through our rms business are complimentary to the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business 

other related research model products and services we also offer two other categories of products and services within rms—endotoxin and microbial detection products and vaccine support 

endotoxin and microbial detection emd or in vitro our emd business provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination we are committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible and toward that goal we work with and support the european center for validation of alternative methods in these efforts endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and only major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test the process of extracting blood is generally not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our in vitro technology business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing which is used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured 

we have developed the next generation of the endotoxin testing platform known as the endosafe portable testing system endosafe®pts™ the pts is a portable endotoxin testing platform which allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or in the field affording researchers accurate and timely results in 2006 we received fda approval for the sale and marketing of the pts system for fdarequired lot release endotoxin testing the pts can also be used for nonregulated applications ranging from drug research and development to environmental monitoring the pts system has recently expanded into markets such as cell transplant and dialysis clinics and especially nuclear pharmacies where pts is being adopted for lot release testing of nuclear medicines in response to pending fda regulations we are anticipating other opportunities developing as our customers react to the fdas process analytical technology pat initiative in addition over the next few years we look towards exploring other applications such as the environmental contaminant markets pesticides and hazardous materials and clinical diagnostics infectious disease at point of care 

vaccine support we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence in north america with several spf egg production facilities in the united states and contracted production capabilities in hungary and franchise operations in india china and australia we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse testing quality control testing of the spf flocks offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines 

preclinical services pcs our pcs customers are principally engaged in the discovery and development of new drugs devices and therapies 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically last anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines 

development activities which follow and which can take up to seven years are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials with our focus on earlystage drug development support we view clinical phase i studies as a strategic component of our preclinical service offerings 

the development services portion of our pcs business enables our customers to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired drug and toxicology disposition activities to us the demand for these services was historically driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of larger global pharmaceutical companies the necessary significant investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently conduct and perform these activities means that global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are frequently choosing to outsource their development activities allowing them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and particularly for pharmaceutical companies promotion and market distribution 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of general and specialty toxicology studies especially those dealing with innovative therapies and biologicals we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada europe and asia china we have recently completed significant expansions at our preclinical facilities in massachusetts and nevada and are nearing completion of an expansion of capacity in canada in recognition of the current market conditions we are postponing the expansion of our ohio facility until such time as our available capacity is filled which we target as 2010 our pcs segment represented 51 of our total net sales in 2008 and employed 59 of our employees including approximately 450 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees 

we currently offer the following preclinical services in which we include both in vivo and in vitro studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development from inception to proof of concept 

toxicology toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected the stage of preclinical development begins where appropriate toxicology studies are conducted to support initial clinical trials these studies are performed on animal models to understand the toxic effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods and focus on safety and potential harmful effects our toxicology services feature 

• all the standard protocols for general toxicity testing genotoxicity safety pharmacology acute subacute chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity potential required for regulatory submissions supporting firstinhuman to firstonthemarket strategies 6 

• expertise in specialty routes of administration and modes of administration eg infusion intravitreal administration and inhalation which are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals but also for safety testing of medical devices industrial chemicals food additives agrochemicals biocides nutraceuticals animal health products and other materials • marketleading expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in support of larger scale human clinical trials • services in important specialty areas such as ocular bone juvenileneonatal and immunotoxicology as well as photobiology and dermal testing • work in all major therapeutic areas • study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience in support of drug development and • a strong history of aiding our sponsors in reaching their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing including studies addressing stem cell therapies dna vaccines recombinant proteins standard small molecules and medical devices our toxicology facilities operate in compliance with good laboratory practices glps as required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other glp compliance monitoring authorities as well as our own and our customers quality assurance departments 

pathology services in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic change is critical in determining the safety of a new compound we employ a large number of highly trained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential compoundrelated changes within tissues fluids and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical for regulatory driven safety studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key gonogo decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients 

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in support of preclinical drug safety testing our customers are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated analytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes including oligonucleotide and inhibitory rnas in the event that the sample analysis for preclinical study support translates to opportunities to analyze clinical samples for the same drug once human testing begins we have opportunities to capture the benefits of bridging preclinical bioanalysis with later clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics andor toxicokinetics of the exposure to the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites by radiolabeled techniques pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered including the process by which the drug is absorbed distributed in the body metabolized and excreted adme toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied to potential toxic substances our clients require these studies for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug the results of which are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound 

discovery support at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the activity and efficacy of drug candidates in several important therapeutic areas including 

• asthma through our specialized disease model colonies • bone disease using our stateoftheart imaging and pathology capabilities • ophthalmology using our models of neovascularization • general cardiovascular and device testing using our surgical models and • early drug formulation and bioanalysis support and method development we also offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria the discovery support services that we offer through our pcs business are complimentary to the discovery and imaging services that we offer through our rms business 

biopharmaceutical services 

we provide specialized characterization identity and safety testing of biologicals frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology developers our laboratories in the united states germany acquired in 2008 through our purchase of newlab bioquality ag scotland and ireland provide timely compliant molecular biology virology bioanalytical immunochemistry microbiology and related services our services in this area confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent correctly defined stable and essentially contaminant free this type of testing is required by the fda and other global regulatory authorities for our customers to obtain new drug approvals to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment 

our manufacturing services group grows and stores wellcharacterized earlystage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials we also collaborate with clients on process development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing 

phase i trials in healthy normal and special populations 

phase i clinical trials are usually short duration studies conducted on a small number 20100 of healthy human subjects although special populations can be used under highly controlled conditions testing is usually performed where trial participants can be closely monitored in a secure environment such as at a clinictype facility or hospital 

our clinical services capabilities are centered around our premier phase i clinic in tacoma washington with a capacity of 250 beds we focus our clinical services business on highend clinical pharmacology studies in healthy participants from a strategic perspective we believe that our clinical services business benefits from pullthrough from our preclinical and laboratory services particularly with our biotechnology customers correspondingly our preclinical and laboratory services businesses benefit from the presence of our phase i clinical offerings as we can take advantage of enhanced economies of scale as well as pulldown from existing clinical customers 

we offer a wide range of phase i clinical research services designed to move lead pharmaceutical candidates rapidly from preclinical development through phase i pharmacokinetic tolerability and pharmacodynamic assessment to explore human pharmacology we can conduct studies across a wide range of therapeutic areas and have demonstrated experience in complex dose tolerance radiolabeled cardiac safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and bioavailability studies in addition we provide customers with highend firstinhuman studies for novel compounds and expertise in complex drugdrug interaction studies participants at our clinics are evaluated through an intensive screening 

process to ensure study suitability we employ clinical regulatory compliance staff to monitor the conduct and reporting of phase i trials and to assure management that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients in accelerating the search for drugs devices and therapies from discovery through proof of concept our goal is to deliver a full portfolio of products and services for drug discovery and development which are almost entirely mandated by law and to partner with our clients to create the greatest value and strategic benefit to them our business is primarily driven by the continued growth of research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the federal government and academic institutions and of outsourced services according to reports by the biomedical industry advisory group it takes 11 to 16 years and costs in the range of 180 million to 165 billion with an average cost of approximately 900 million to bring a new drug to market similarly a separate report by the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america estimate that it takes 10 to 15 years and costs in excess of 800 million to develop a drug 12 billion for a biologic 

as the pressure to develop a strong pipeline of innovative new drugs increases so does the pressure to contain costs to implement research in multiple countries simultaneously and to identify hire and retain a breadth of scientific and technical experts these pressures are becoming more intense as patent expiries approach for many of our customers leading them to increasingly rationalize their portfolios around therapeutic areas streamline their operations and look to outside partners to manage their noncore activities in order to facilitate and speed their research as well as to convert largely fixed costs into variable expenses our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are increasingly making strategic decisions to outsource services which can be provided by highquality full service providers like us for instance many of our larger customers—particularly those in the pharmaceutical industry—have announced plans to rationalize their workforce and facilities andor increase outsourcing in order to concentrate on their core businesses and new product research and identification these challenges are also leading to an increase in the role of procurement for cost control purposes resulting in more bundled services and unique and deeper partnership arrangements from the perspective of both facility management and breadth of service over the past several years we believe that the increase in these actions and the necessary growth of outsourcing is being driven by a unique confluence of events including 

• the current outlook for drugs coming off patent protection and resulting threats from generic drug manufacturers which are expected to affect a large percentage of these companies existing revenues in the intermediate future up to an estimated 30 of pharmaceutical companies revenues by 2012 • the reduction over the past decade in growth rate of drugs gaining approval • increased pressure to find drugs to cure critical diseases many of which are complex and chronic and affect small patient populations increasing risk and cost of development while segmenting and shrinking the patient populations from blockbusters to smaller more specialized indications • continued productivity and cost containment pressures on the medical device diagnostics and biopharmaceutical industries due in part to escalating global healthcare costs increasing concentration of buying power attributable to larger payors and governments while customers in those fields simultaneously need to manage increased financial focus on operating margins and returns • increasing globalization of drug development particularly increased research and development activity in the india and china markets • heightened regulatory authority scrutiny worldwide particularly concerning drug safety and 9 

• enhanced urgency to push the growing number of new compounds through the drug pipeline outsourcing allows our customers to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on early drug discovery while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours who can help optimize our clients programs and assist in accelerating the drug discovery and development process our strategy is to capitalize on these opportunities by continuing to build our portfolio of premium valueadded products and services through internal development and investment augmented by strategic bolton transactions 

our customers have faced a challenging market environment toward the end of 2008 and start of 2009 among the factors that have affected them we have seen the following have the most material impact 

• large pharmaceutical companies have intensified their costsavings and efficiency actions and have announced significant initiatives to improve their research and development productivity and enhance their drug pipelines this focus has been manifested through reductions in infrastructure and by spending constraints in the short term we have seen large pharmaceuticals slow down their preclinical and phase i studies in favor of their laterstage products as they reprioritize compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate • biotechnology customers particularly those that are cashnegative have been highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment in general funding for biotechnology companies has been compromised by the current economic crisis • many customers are narrowing their pipeline focus to a smaller number of similar high potential therapeutic areas where they may yield the greatest returns • many larger customers have diversified their technology platform bases and have focused their portfolios across biologics therapeutic proteins antibodies rnai and vaccines while retaining their core expertise in small molecules • our customers generally have been focused on nearterm cost constraints as they contend with the challenges of the global economic slowdown and • senior management turnover and structural realignment has resulted in some internal turmoil and slower decisionmaking in some of our larger customers while they finalize and rollout their restructuring plans while the short term consequences of these actions have temporarily mitigated the outsourcing growth rate trends we believe that in the midterm there is no fundamental change in our clients drug development activities and strategies and in fact these changes will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities going forward in particular we believe that as larger pharmaceutical companies become leaner and more efficient they will also become more conservative in their staffing lose experienced personnel and generally focus on their core competencies of fundamental research and development and commercialization this should lead to resumption of outsourcing as they assess their key internal priorities charles river is positioned to address our customers future needs as we can 

• provide external expertise which may be too costly for our customers to build andor maintain inhouse • partner with customers to allow them to compensate for recent capacity reductions • provide flexible arrangements to better balance our clients workloadstaff requirements • provide customized solutions by therapeutic area • address our customers demands for noncore but strategically important activities such as in vivo biology general and specialty toxicology and program management and 10 

• provide value to our customers through broadbased partnerships across the breadth of the charles river portfolio in todays business environment we believe there is a particular advantage in being a global full service highquality provider of services throughout the drug discovery and development continuum many of our customers especially large pharmaceutical companies are attracted to tier 1 contract research organizations with a full breadth of capabilities and choose to establish preferred provider relationships with only a small number which allows them to simplify their relationship management as well as access greater value from their outsourcing partner recent trends suggest that large pharmaceutical restructurings with increased focus on key therapeutic areas may favor larger contract research organizations who can present customers with the benefits of economies of scale and scope global footprint and simplified communications and coordination those companies with critical mass and financial stability are likely to have an advantage as we expect that customers will gravitate towards placing longterm studies with providers they can rely upon we are focused on being recognized as a premier preferred provider and building broader and deeper longterm strategic partnerships with our customers accordingly with many of our largest customers we enter into global preferred provider agreements that span both segments of our business and as the role of the procurement department of our customers in selecting outsourcing partners increases we expect that global reach and the availability of valueadded services will become essential which will aid charles river in capitalizing on future opportunities in addition in response to individual customer needs we have also been flexible in entering into broadbased multiyear partnering arrangements generally involving financial commitments from the customer which tap into the broad array of physical andor service resources that we provide such as reserving dedicated space within existing facilities building out space to a particular specification working within our clients infrastructure or even establishing a new facility 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the drug development continuum primarily through internal development which will be augmented as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing stockholder value this strategy may include geographic expansion of existing core services strengthening of one of our core services or the addition of a new product or service in a related or adjacent business in 2008 we completed 6 acquisitions ranging in size from 485 million to 14 million 

we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities as strategic outsourcing by our customers increases we believe that our expertise in areas previously addressed by our customers inhouse capabilities allows us to provide a more flexible efficient and costeffective alternative for them in short because these products and services are the core of our business we are able to build and maintain expertise and tap into economies of scale that are difficult for our customers to match with their internal capabilities 

we intend to focus our marketing efforts on among other things stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio we believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of in vivo biology are increasingly attractive to our customers and we are aligning our commercial activities to deliver flexible customized programs designed to meet our clients global and sitespecific needs with an increasing emphasis on defining efficiency metrics and tangible value in addition as our customers narrow their focus toward specific therapeutic areas we have increasingly aligned our services portfolio along therapeutic lines particularly those subject to major research areas such as oncology metabolism inflammation and cardiovascular we have also focused on adding expertise in the biologics development areas as a result of these collective efforts we expect to be better positioned to gain market share by taking advantage of these trends as well as broader based collaboration across the in vivo discovery to firstinhuman continuum in 2007 and 2008 we invested heavily in expanding our facilities capacity which we expect to normalize beginning in 2009 similarly 

we are investing in our information technology systems and resources in order to better serve our customers harmonize our data and streamline our processes 

customers 

our customers continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies animal health medical device diagnostic and other life sciences companies and leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our customers during 2008 no single commercial customer accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 10 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe canada japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 10 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams the majority of whom work in north america with the balance in europe and the asiapacific countries our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and asia we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with trade advertising direct mail and newsletters in 2008 we launched our newly designed website the direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents for our products and services particularly with respect to our emd and biopharmaceutical services business 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we maintain clientcustomer service technical assistance and consulting service departments which address both our customers routine and more specialized needs we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical and clinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our customers 

competition 

our strategy is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation responsiveness pricing innovation breadth of therapeutic and scientific expertise timeliness and availability supported by our professional bench strength in animal science and toxicology global capabilities and strategically located facilities worldwide we are able to offer a unique portfolio through our broad array of both routine and specialized preclinical services as well as a wide range of research models and research model services 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies 

• for rms our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america each of whom have a global scope and several smaller competitors in europe and in japan of our main us competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships 12 

• as for pcs we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world based on net service revenue our commercial competitors for preclinical services consist of both publicly held and privately owned companies and it is estimated that the top five participants including charles river account for approximately 50 of the global market exclusive of clinical services with the rest of the market remaining highly fragmented our pcs segment including our phase i business also competes with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies universities and teaching hospitals independently the phase i clinical services market is highly fragmented with many public and private participants sharing the bulk of the market augmented by a number of smaller limitedservice providers also providing capacity we believe that the barriers to entry in certain of our business units particularly those which require substantial capital expenditures trained and specialized personnel and mandate glp compliant practices are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical area of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 27 2008 we had approximately 9000 employees including approximately 577 science professionals with advanced degrees including approximately 143 dvms 191 phds and 13 mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our annual satisfaction surveys indicate that we have an excellent relationship with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment was approximately 3107 million at december 27 2008 as compared to 393 million at december 29 2007 our preclinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a customers intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are 

included in 2008 backlog may be completed in 2009 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments as described below 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and for certain species environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs aaalac covers all species of laboratory animals including rats mice and birds our preclinical business is also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical laboratory safety studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients products throughout the world a minor part of our rms business also conducts similar studies for our clients the conduct of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which nonclinical laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada state food and drug administration of the peoples republic of china and the japanese ministry of health and welfare glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of 

qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our pcs business also conducts human phase i clinical trials and provides services in support of our clients registration or licensing applications human clinical trials are conducted in a progressive fashion beginning with phase i and in the case of approved drugs continued through phase iv trials phase i studies are the initial human clinical trials and are conducted with a small number of subjects under highly controlled conditions these clinical trials and services are performed in accordance with the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practice consolidated guidance and in compliance with regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human clinical trial subjects in the united states these trials and services must comply with fda regulations and in europe our clinical trials and services must comply with the clinical trials directive of the european union neither fda regulations nor the clinical trials directive requires a quality assurance program however our phase i facilities have established quality assurance units that monitor the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing business produces endotoxin test kits reagents cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production and vaccine support products additionally several of our laboratories conduct identity stability and potency testing in support of our clients manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and other national regulatory agencies under their respective good manufacturing practice gmp regulations we are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to gmp compliance and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities we also maintain an establishment license with usdas center for veterinary biologics cvb that covers certain of our sites which manufacture antigens used in a licensed diagnostic kit for rodents or—particular to our vaccine support business—which manufacturer usda licensed antigens antibodies and viruses that are sold to clients for use in the manufacturing of their own usda licensed products our vaccine support business also manufactures and markets two usda licensed products that are considered final use products mycoplasma gallisepticum antigen and mycoplasma synoviae antigen and sites involved in the manufacture of these articles are subject to regular inspection by usdacvb 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws which include the usda the standards set by the international air transport association and european oversight agencies failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance we have established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all quality assurance functions within the company headed by our corporate vice president for regulatory affairs and compliance 

intellectual property 

we have developed and implemented computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success we believe that such factors as the technical expertise proprietary knowhow ability and experience of our professionals are more important and that overall 

these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients where we consider it appropriate steps are taken to protect our knowhow through confidentiality agreements and protection through registration of title or use in addition we inlicense technology and products from other companies where it enhances both our product and services business in the future inlicensing may become a larger initiative to enhancing our offerings particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise with the exception of technology related to our in vitro testing business including the endosafepts we have no patents trademarks licenses franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of the products or services we offer are dependent 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 nine of the ten members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to the company or management and all of our board committees are composed entirely of independent directors the board adheres to corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have a related person transactions policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements we have a global process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and ethics and related person transactions policy are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the investor relations—corporate governance caption 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

  set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past several years some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities while industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a decrease in preclinical andor clinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k furthermore our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on compounds in the preclinical phase of research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations in particular recent studies have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries including funding for biotechnology companies which have suffered during the economic downturn in 20082009 also affect their research and development budgets and consequentially our business as well the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the research and development budgets at our pharmaceutical customers have recently slowed down their preclinical and phase i studies in favor of their laterstage products as they reprioritize compound pipelines focusing on the backend of their pipelines in the nearterm and moderate their spending per drug candidate for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in the form 10k 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities although recent reports indicate that the new administrations stimulus package includes a substantial increase in nih funding for 2009 nih funding has remained fairly flat in recent years and a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the united states strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new regulations are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected 

in recent years the us congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any similar reform movements have occurred in europe and asia 

implementation of health care reform legislation that contains costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings furthermore if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products our customers may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 

our standard customer agreements contain customerdetermined termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested the customers decision to forego or terminate a particular study or the loss of funding for the particular research study if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business particularly our pcs segment and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may underprice or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons and often at the discretion of the customer the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventitious infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production or services such cleanups result in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments in addition to microbiological 

contaminations the potential for genetic mixups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies while this does not require the complete cleanup renovation and disinfection of the barrier room it would likely result in inventory loss additional startup costs and possibly reduced sales in addition contaminations expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our customers facilities with similar impact to them in some cases we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in man and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection 

all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries have represented approximately onehalf our total net sales in recent years we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

• foreign currencies we receive for sales and which we record as expenses outside the united states could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue and increase the amount of expenses that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results • certain contracts particularly in canada are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations • general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate • potential international conflicts including terrorist acts • potential trade restrictions exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states • difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of violations of local laws or the us foreign corrupt practices act by employees overseas or the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements • the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations • unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions • longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and • import and export licensing requirements upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions 

we currently are engaged in a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide integrated enterprise resource planning erp 

system the process of planning and preparing for such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion system cutover and user training problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues there have been numerous wellpublicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention impacting the industry this has included onsite demonstrations near facilities operated by us any negative attention threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large animal models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems export or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions increased competition amongst suppliers for models disruptions to the air travel system or other normalcourse or unanticipated events any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results 

any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from participants in connection with a particular phase i clinical trial the data collected from that trial could be disqualified and we might be required to redo the trial at no further cost to our customer but at substantial cost to us furthermore the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us 

in addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated notably there has been a recent updating of guidance in europe that will be implemented over a period of several years on a countrybycountry basis similarly guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community including transportation and the use of disinfectants in the united states an updating of guidance used by the national institutes of health and by certain oversight agencies has been recently funded and it is expected that over the next 3 years standards will be updated for the care and use of laboratory animals in all aspects of our us business units these new guidelines could cause us increased costs attributable to additional facilities the need to add personnel to address new processes as well as increased administrative burden and the upgrading of existing facilities 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals we compete on a variety of factors including 

• reputation for ontime quality performance • reputation for regulatory compliance • expertise and experience in specific areas • scope and breadth of service and product offerings • broad geographic availability • pricevalue • technological expertise and efficient drug development processes • quality of facilities • financial stability • size • ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner and • ability to manage phase i clinical trials both domestically and internationally if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies although recent trends in late 2008 and early 2009 may signal increased merger activity between larger pharmaceutical companies themselves if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and contract research organizations generally with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates in addition while there are substantial barriers to entry for large global competitors with broadbased services small specialized entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities in acquiring and rolling up these companies thus further increasing possible competition furthermore in recent years both charles river and our competitors particularly in the preclinical services area have been investing in capital projects to increase capacity an ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing capacity growth and market demand if capacity has been increased too much pressure to lower prices or to take on lowermargin studies and projects may occur these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada and the united kingdom 

we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or allowances would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits cash flow and our effective tax rate 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including customer relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our initial assessment step one for 2008 the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired as economic conditions worsened late in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated coupled with a decrease in our market capitalization management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment test as of december 27 2008 our analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 700 million 

goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could 

impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 27 2008 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 5937 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

• errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical or phase i clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing • litigation risk including resulting from our errors or omissions associated with the possibility that the drugscompounds of our clients that were included in drug development trials we participated in may cause illness personal injury or have other negative side effects to clinical study participants or other persons including death • general risks associated with operating a phase i clinical business including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers • risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers property such as research models and samples study compounds records work in progress other archived materials or goods and materials in transit while in our possession • risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we run may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals and • errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections 

in our pcs business we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients investigators and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and pcs businesses contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

we may be unable to build out our facilities as anticipated 

to support our customers demand for drug discovery and development services including increased strategic focus on outsourcing services and programs we had engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program over the past two years with 227 million spent on capital expenditures in 

2007 and 197 million in 2008 we estimated 100120 million allocated for capital expenditures in 2009 as major expansions complete and capacity comes online included in our 2009 capital plan are the following continuing fitout work at our new pcs facility in nevada dedicated space initiatives at our new pcs facility in massachusetts expansions at our canada and scotland pcs facilities and the remaining work for completing the construction of our new pcs facility in china we cannot assure you that any or all of these facilities or any particular phase of such facilities will be constructed on the anticipated timetable or on budget any material delay in bringing these facilities online or substantial increase in costs to complete these facilities could materially and adversely affect us in addition the costs of these capacity expansion programs may have an adverse impact on our operating margins particularly within our pcs business 

if we are unable to attract suitable participants for our phase i clinical trials our business might suffer 

the phase i clinical research studies we run rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of subjects participants generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted which such communities to date have provided a substantial pool of potential subjects for research studies our phase i clinical research activities could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing participants on a consistent basis 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas including vaccine development that may have scientific merit in addition technological improvements to existing or new processes such as imaging technology could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method or other method that reduces the need for animal research models as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets for instance we acquired imaging capabilities in 2008 through our acquisition of mir preclinical however we generally may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services 

we may seek to develop and market new services that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings if we are unable to develop new services andor create demand for those newly developed services our future business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 27 2008 we had approximately 5758 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates for additional information regarding our debt please see note 4 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

during the past seven years we have expanded our business through several acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing transactions for instance in 2008 we expensed over 13 million for costs incurred for potential deals that we decided to abandon prior to signing definitive agreements 

even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products or technologies • challenges with developing and operating new businesses including diversion of managements attention from other business concerns • potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller • acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders • loss of key employees of the acquired companies • risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies • the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies and • difficulties in achieving business and financial success in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of customer data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical and the clinical studies we conduct for our customers unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our customers typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the 

information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for over 30 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our management if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as 

• the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements • the commencement postponement progress completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter • changes in the mix of our products and services • the extent of cost overruns • holiday patterns of our customers • budget cycles of our customers • the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events and • exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

continuing operations 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services we provide our products and services to global pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently our broad portfolio of products and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed to market and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of regulatory compliant preclinical services which address drug discovery and development in the preclinical arena we have been in business for over 60 years and currently operate approximately 70 facilities in 17 countries worldwide 

our sales growth in 2008 was driven by continued spending by major pharmaceuticals biotechnology companies and academic institutions on our global products and services which aid in their development of new drugs and products partially offset by the impact of the slower economy and world wide credit crisis we expect the longterm drivers for our business as a whole primarily to emerge from our customers continued demand for research models and services and regulatory compliant preclinical services as well as increased strategic focus on outsourcing during the second half of 2008 demand for our services decelerated at a greater rate than products impacting our growth rate we believe this was primarily due to emerging factors which include business restructuring and reprioritization of pipelines by pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients which led to significant and accelerating study slippage and delays lack of funding for biotechnology companies and tight cost controls which resulted in more measured spending and some pricing pressure 

our 2009 expectations reflect softer market demand particularly for preclinical services which will continue at least until midyear we believe that our clients will continue to outsource drug development services as they strive to improve the efficiency of their drug pipelines for additional discussion of the factors that we believe are influencing outsourcing demand from our customers please see the section entitled our strategy included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we are using this period of market uncertainty to streamline our operations and have implemented additional actions to improve our operating efficiency these actions include initiating a hiring freeze a salary freeze for a substantial percentage of our workforce including all incentiveeligible employees continued tight control of discretionary spending and implementing a headcount reduction affecting 3 of our total workforce predominately in our pcs business segment and the closure of our arkansas facility as a result of these costsaving actions the company will take a onetime charge in 2009 of approximately 90 million the company expects that these actions will reduce costs by approximately 200 million in 2009 with an annual runrate of approximately 250 million we also are pursuing strategic alternatives for our clinical phase i operation in scotland with an intention to divest these operations 

our capital expenditures totaled 1971 million in 2008 and our planned capital expenditures in 2009 are in the range of 100 million to 120 million as a result of the factors which are affecting our sales growth we evaluated our expansion plans and determined that we have sufficient capacity to accommodate our clients current demand we expect to open the sherbrooke canada facility in the first half of 2009 in order to relieve capacity constraints at our montreal facility we have delayed the expansion of our ohio facility until 2010 when we believe the industry will be better positioned to absorb additional capacity 

in addition to internally generated organic growth our business strategy includes strategic bolton acquisitions that complement our business increase the rate of our growth or geographically 

expand our existing services as evidenced by our acquisitions of newlab bioquality ag and mir preclinical services in 2008 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our initial assessment step one for 2008 the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired as economic conditions worsened late in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook were not as strong as anticipated coupled with a decrease in our market capitalization management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment test as of december 27 2008 our analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 700 million 

total net sales in 2008 were 13 billion an increase of 92 over 2007 with demand decelerating during the second half of the year the sales increase was due primarily to increased customer demand and higher pricing in research models and services rms strong large model safety testing and certain specialty toxicology sales partially offset by slower demand for pcs due to our clients restructuring and reprioritization efforts particularly in europe the effect of foreign currency translation added 13 to sales growth our gross margin decreased to 380 of net sales compared to 389 of net sales in 2007 due primarily to lower sales growth 

our operating loss for 2008 was 4498 million compared to income of 2272 million for 2007 primarily due to the goodwill impairment of 700 million in 2008 

net loss from continuing operations was 5223 million in 2008 compared to income of 1576 million in 2007 diluted loss per share from continuing operations for 2008 was 776 compared to earnings per share of 229 in 2007 

we report two segments rms and pcs which reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed 

our rms segment which represented 491 of net sales in 2008 includes sales of research models genetically engineered models and services gems research animal diagnostics discovery and imaging services consulting and staffing services vaccine support and in vitro technology primarily endotoxin testing although demand decelerated during the second half of the year net sales for this segment increased 143 compared to 2007 due to increased small model sales in the united states and europe increased consulting and staffing services and strong in vitro sales favorable foreign currency translation increased the net sales gain by 37 we experienced decreases in both the rms gross margin and operating margin compared to last year to 431 from 432 and to 301 from 307 respectively due mainly to the impact of the greater proportion of services in the sales mix and the secondquarter increase in operating expenses in japan 

our pcs segment which represented 509 of net sales in 2008 includes services required to take a drug through the development process including discovery support toxicology pathology biopharmaceutical bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services as well as phase i clinical trials sales for this segment increased 46 over 2007 however demand decelerated during the second half of the year sales were driven by continuing demand for large model safety testing and certain specialty toxicology studies as well as the acquisition of newlab bioquality ag partially offset by more measured pharmaceutical spending due to our clients restructuring and reprioritization efforts particularly in europe unfavorable foreign currency decreased sales growth by 09 we experienced a decrease in the pcs gross margin during 2008 to 331 from 350 in 2007 due mainly to the lower sales growth and additional costs associated with the transition to the new preclinical facility in nevada and startup costs in china as a result of the goodwill impairment the 2008 operating margin was a negative 873 compared to 158 in 2007 

net income 

net loss for 2008 was 5218 million compared to income of 1544 million in 2007 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management believes the following critical accounting policies are most affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates reflect our more significant judgments and estimates than usual in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement 

• goodwill and other intangible assets • revenue recognition • pension plan accounting • stockbased compensation and • income taxes and deferred tax assets goodwill other intangible assets we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates these estimates are based on among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 

we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined by using a weighted combination of a marketbased approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the marketbased approach we utilize information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn determining 

the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and future market conditions among others our projections are based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired however if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess in determining the fair value of assets we utilize appraisals for the fair value of property and equipment and valuations of certain intangible assets including customer relationships 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on our initial assessment step one for 2008 the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value therefore our goodwill was not impaired as economic conditions worsened late in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated coupled with a decrease in our market capitalization management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment test as of december 27 2008 our analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value our pcs business was less than its carrying value the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill for the pcs business the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the pcs business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of 700 million 

goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually the results of this years impairment test are as of a point in time if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated andor our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as of december 27 2008 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 5937 million in the consolidated balance sheet 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product and services sales we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreedupon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts revenue of agreedupon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based on rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to estimated costs to complete procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols our fixed fee service contracts which are utilized mainly in our preclinical segment vary in term from a few days to greater than a year with the majority of such contracts having a term of less than six months management reviews the costs incurred and services provided to date on these contracts in relation to the total estimated effort to complete the contract as a result of the reviews revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known these judgments and estimates are not expected to result in a change that would materially affect our reported results in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service 

performed in advance of billing the customer with the offset to unbilled receivable as of december 27 2008 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 518 million and deferred revenue of 867 million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts 

pension plan accounting as of december 27 2008 we had a pension liability of 322 million the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 27 2008 the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans was 574 

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the assets allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 13 million 

during 2008 our board of directors voted to freeze the accrual of benefits under our us pension plan effective april 30 2008 in accordance with sfas no 88 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits we recorded a curtailment gain of 33 million in 2008 

stockbased compensation we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period during the year ended december 27 2008 we recognized 243 million of stock compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock and performance based stock awards 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straightline basis over the vesting periods of the awards net of estimated forfeitures forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical prevesting forfeitures and are updated on vesting date to reflect actual forfeitures 

estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment including estimating stockprice volatility expected term expected dividends and riskfree interest rates the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise and postvesting cancellation patterns of our stock options expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections the riskfree interest rate is based on the market yield of us treasury securities for periods approximating the expected terms of the options in effect at the time of grant these assumptions are updated on at least an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 

the fair value of option based stock awards granted during 2008 was estimated on the grant date using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 



income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 27 2008 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1929 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us federal and state taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this undistributed foreign income 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our tax provision is based upon enacted tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in tax rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes to change resulting in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

effective december 31 2006 we adopted the provisions of fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109 which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized income tax items measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and financial statement disclosure under fin 48 we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such positions are measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our global business operations we are subject to income tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe we have sufficiently provided for all audit exposures and assessments settlements of these audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may result in an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate 

segment operations 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 



  



in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

net sales net sales in 2008 were 13435 million an increase of 1129 million or 92 from 12306 million in 2007 

research models and services in 2008 net sales for our rms segment were 6599 million an increase of 827 million or 143 from 5772 million in 2007 due to increased small model sales in the united states and europe increased consulting and staffing services and strong in vitro sales favorable foreign currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 37 rms sales increased due to pricing and unit volume increases in both models including large models and services the rms sales growth was driven by increases in basic research and biotechnology spending which drove greater demand for our products and services 

preclinical services in 2008 net sales for our pcs segment were 6836 million an increase of 302 million or 46 compared to 6534 million in 2007 sales were driven by continuing demand for large model safety testing and certain specialty toxicology studies as well as the acquisition of newlab bioquality ag partially offset by more measured pharmaceutical spending due to our clients restructuring and reprioritization efforts particularly in europe unfavorable foreign currency had a negative impact on sales growth by 09 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2008 was 8328 million an increase of 804 million or 107 from 7524 million in 2007 cost of products sold and services provided in 2008 was 620 of net sales compared to 611 in 2007 

research models and services cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2008 was 3753 million an increase of 475 million or 145 compared to 3278 million in 2007 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was 569 compared to 568 in 2007 the greater facility utilization was the result of the increased sales during the quarter partially offset by an unfavorable product mix due to greater growth in the lower margin service area 

preclinical services cost of services provided for the pcs segment in 2008 was 4575 million an increase of 329 million or 78 compared to 4246 million in 2007 cost of services provided as a 

percentage of net sales was 669 in 2008 compared to 650 in 2007 the increase in cost of services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the impact of lower sales growth and the startup and transition costs of pcs nevada facilities 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in 2008 were 2302 million an increase of 127 million or 58 from 2175 million in 2007 selling general and administrative expenses in 2008 were 171 of net sales compared to 177 of net sales in 2007 

research models and services selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2008 were 833 million an increase of 130 million or 185 compared to 703 million in 2007 selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to 126 in 2008 from 122 in 2007 due mainly to higher operating costs 

preclinical services selling general and administrative expenses for the pcs segment in 2008 were 948 million an increase of 11 million or 12 compared to 937 million in 2007 selling general and administrative expenses in 2008 decreased to 139 of net sales compared to 143 in 2007

liquidity and capital resources 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations the convertible debt offering our marketable securities and our revolving line of credit arrangements 

we had marketable securities of 190 million and 634 million as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively the decline was primarily due to managements decision to move funds into cash equivalent type investments as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 we had 190 million and 382 million invested in auction rate securities rated aaa by a major credit rating agency our auction rate securities are guaranteed by us federal agencies these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals usually every 7 or 35 days the overall credit concerns in the capital markets as well as the failed auctions of these securities have impacted our ability to liquidate these investments the auctions for the securities we own continue to fail the investment may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 

in 2006 we issued 3500 million of 225 convertible senior notes the 2013 notes due in 2013 at december 27 2008 the fair value of our outstanding 2013 notes was approximately 3111 based on their quoted market value during the fourth quarter of 2008 no conversion triggers were met 

concurrently with the sale of the 2013 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our obligation to deliver common stock under the 2013 notes the convertible note hedges give us the right to receive for no additional consideration the numbers of shares of common stock that we are obligated to deliver upon conversion of the 2013 notes subject to antidilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2013 notes and expire on june 15 2013 the aggregate cost of these convertible note hedges was 983 million 

separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 2013 notes we issued warrants for approximately 72 million shares of our common stock the warrants give the holders the right to receive for no additional consideration cash or shares at our option with a value equal to the appreciation in the price of our shares above 59925 and expire between september 13 2013 and 

january 22 2014 over 90 equal increments the total proceeds from the issuance of the warrants were 654 million 

from our economic perspective the cumulative impact of the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants increases the effective conversion price of the 2013 notes from 4894 to 59925 per share 

we currently have a 428 million credit agreement and a 50 million credit agreement at december 27 2008 we had term loans of 1349 million and 900 million under our revolving credit facility outstanding as of december 27 2008 we had 1044 million available to borrow under our revolving credit agreements as of december 27 2008 we were compliant with all financial covenants specified in the credit agreements for additional information regarding the 2013 notes the 428 million credit agreement and the 50 million credit agreement please see note 4 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the first quarter of 2009 the company plans to repatriate approximately 900 million of the earnings of its nonus subsidiaries as such the company has changed its permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to these unremitted earnings as a result of the change in assertion the company recorded a tax benefit primarily due to foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2008 of 72 million of which 40 million was reflected in the effective tax rate and 32 million was reflected in the cumulative translation account the proceeds from the repatriation will be used for general corporate purposes the company continues to maintain its permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of its nonus subsidiaries 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program originally authorized on july 27 2005 and subsequently amended on october 26 2005 may 9 2006 august 1 2007 and july 24 2008 to acquire up to a total of 6000 million of common stock the program does not have a fixed expiration date in order to facilitate these share repurchases the company has entered into rule 10b51 purchase plans as of december 27 2008 approximately 1871 million remained authorized for share repurchases 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 2436 million at december 27 2008 compared to 2254 million at december 29 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 and 2007 was 2795 million and 2884 million respectively the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue our days sales outstanding dso of 40 days as of december 27 2008 increased from 35 days at december 29 2007 our dso includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation 

net cash used in investing activities in 2008 and 2007 was 2272 million and 2008 million respectively our capital expenditures in 2008 were 1971 million of which 605 million was related to rms and 1366 million to pcs for 2009 we project capital expenditures to be in the range of 100 to 120 million we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by operating activities and existing credit facilities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2008 was 173 million and 464 million in 2007 during 2008 we purchased 1151 million of treasury stock and repaid debt of 365 million partially offset by proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and warrants of 285 million and proceeds from debt of 1020 million during 2007 we purchased 416 million of treasury stock and repaid 645 million of debt partially offset by proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of 540 million 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 27 2008 are as follows 



the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 287 million refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the conversion features of our 2013 notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity therefore these instruments meet the scope of exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points from levels at december 27 2008 then the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately 02 million 

we have entered into two credit agreements the 428 million credit agreement and the 50 million credit agreement our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the 

base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans in the 428 million credit agreement and in the 50 million agreement and our revolving credit facilities our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 33 million on a pretax basis 

we issued 350 million of the 2013 notes in a private placement in the second quarter of 2006 the convertible senior debenture notes bear an interest rate of 225 the fair market value of the outstanding notes was 3111 million on december 27 2008 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies however a portion of our foreign operations revenue is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate certain transactions as hedges as set forth in sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

during 2008 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items no foreign exchange contracts were outstanding on december 27 2008

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services including phase i clinical services we provide the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for 60 years we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development our customer base includes global pharmaceutical companies a wide range of biotechnology companies as well as government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world we currently operate over 80 facilities including our production and warehousing facilities in 15 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research a large and growing market in 2006 our net sales from continuing operations were 106 billion and our operating income from continuing operations was 1882 million 

in 2004 we acquired inveresk research group inc a leading provider of drug development services to companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries that acquisition broadened our portfolio of highend services including general toxicology specialty toxicology and phase i clinical services in addition to the laterstage clinical services business of inveresk in addition acquiring inveresk 

·   significantly expanded our overall corporate size

·   significantly increased the breadth of the products and services that we offer and

·   expanded and strengthened our global footprint in the growing market for pharmaceutical research and development services

acquiring inveresk was a critical step in our continuing mission to support our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers who are increasingly seeking full service global partners to whom they can outsource more of their preclinical research and development efforts consistent with our philosophy to focus on our core competencies in august 2006 we divested the phase iiiv clinical services business that had previously been part of inveresk although we retained the phase i clinical services business which we believe serves as an integral part of our preclinical development processes and service offerings to enhance our phase i service offerings we acquired a us phase i clinical services company northwest kinetics inc in october 2006 

as part of the divestiture of the phase iiiv clinical service business in august 2006 we changed our business reporting segments to better reflect our results of operations and facilitate understanding of our business we currently have two reporting segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs which includes phase i clinical services 

research models and services rms   charles river has been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947 with approximately 150 different strains we continue to maintain 

our position as the global leader in the production and sale of research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in supporting the use of research models in drug development with multiple facilities located on three continents north america europe and asia japan we maintain production centers including a total of approximately 160 barrier rooms or isolator facilities strategically located near our customers in addition we are in process of expanding our existing us west coast capacity with additional construction which is expected to partially open in the first half of 2007 in 2006 rms accounted for 49 of our total net sales and approximately 42 of our employees including approximately 60 science professionals with advanced degrees 

our rms segment is comprised of 1 research models 2 research model services and 3 other related businesses 

research models   a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models principally purposebred rats mice and other rodents for use by researchers we provide our rodent models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies a broad range of biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospitals and academic institutions our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process

our rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality in the breeding process our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the animals are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently highquality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

·   outbred animals which are genetically heterogeneous

·   inbred animals which are genetically identical

·   hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents

·   spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and

·   other genetically modified research models including knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic animals which contain genetic material transferred from a different species

since 2001 we have been offering new and proprietary diseasespecific rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on four areas of research cardiovascular metabolic renal and oncology which in addition to providing overlapping disease modalities that support multiple uses of certain models also will permit us to concentrate on focused sales and marketing efforts 

we believe that over the next several years many new research models will be developed and used in biomedical research such as transgenic models with modified genetic material knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models that incorporate or exclude a particular gene these more highly defined and characterized models will allow researchers to further focus their investigations into 

disease conditions and potential new therapies or interventions we intend to build upon our position as a leader in this field to expand our presence in this market for highervalue research models 

in addition to our small research models we also are a global leader in providing purposebred high quality specific pathogenfree spf or disease free large research models to the biomedical research community principally for use in their drug development and testing studies 

research model services   rms also offers a variety of services described below designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates faster including those which are related to genetically defined research models for inhouse research as well as those services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the customer’s drug evaluation process these services address the growing need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business we currently offer four major categories of research models services—transgenic services laboratory services consulting and staffing services and preconditioning services

transgenic services   in this area of our business we assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing research models purchased or created by them for biomedical research activities while the creation of a transgenic model can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of genetically engineered research models requires significant additional technical expertise we provide transgenic breeding expertise model characterization including genotyping and phenotyping and colony development quarantine embryo cryopreservation embryo transfer and health and genetic monitoring we provide these services to over 200 laboratories around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities and maintain more than 1000 different types of naturally occurring or experimentally manipulated research models for our customers

laboratory services   we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customer’s needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in model development and characterization and utilization of specific disease models and genetically engineered models will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for health and genetic testing of laboratory animals

preconditioning services   augmenting our traditional model production and transgenic services described above we believe there are emerging opportunities to provide customers with preconditioning services which center upon speeding the development process by providing studyready research models as a result of our veterinary medicine expertise we are well positioned to provide preconditioning services such as those required for development of drugs for obesity or hypertension additionally models of subclinical disease can be created through surgical approaches thereby providing a model for study that otherwise may not be commercially available in furtherance of our preconditioning services we offer related surgical services in the united states europe and asia this valueadded service offering enhances the basic research model by preparing models to be used in studies immediately upon arrival at the customer’s facility rather than requiring time and effort on the part of the customer to prepare the models

consulting and staffing services   building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage animal care operations including recruitment training staffing and management services on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers demand for our services results from the growing trend by these large institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to the core scientific innovation process or for which they do not maintain the necessary resources inhouse in addition we believe that our expertise in animal 

care and facility operations enhances the productivity and quality of our customers’ animal care and use programs 

other related research model businesses   we also offer two other categories of products and services within rms—vaccine support and in vitro technology products

vaccine support   we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence that includes several spf egg production facilities in the united states a joint venture in mexico and production capabilities in hungary we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse testing and support services to our customers and produces poultry diagnostics

in vitro technology   our in vitro business provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs we are committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible and toward that goal we work with and support the european center for validation of alternative methods in these efforts endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and only major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test for endotoxin detection in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing the process of extracting blood is generally not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our in vitro technology business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing which is used for fdarequired quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured

we have developed the next generation of the endotoxin testing platform known as the endosafe portable testing system endosafe®pts the pts is a portable endotoxin testing platform which allows endotoxin testing in the field affording researchers accurate and timely results in july 2006 we received fda approval for the sale and marketing of the pts system for fdarequired lot release testing the pts can also be used for nonregulated applications ranging from drug research and development to environmental monitoring as an example a modified version of the pts was launched into space in december 2006 aboard the space shuttle discovery and reached the international space station as part of nasa’s ongoing efforts to conduct biological research in space we are also investigating expanding the use of the pts system for endotoxin testing into other markets such as nuclear pharmacies cell transplant dialysis clinics testing for sterile water other contaminants such as pesticides and clinical diagnostics 

preclinical services pcs 

our pcs customers are principally engaged in the discovery and development of new drugs devices and therapies 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed at the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically last anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines

development activities which follow are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials we view 

earlystage clinical phase i studies as an essential strategic component of our preclinical service offerings 

the development services portion of our pcs segment enables our customers to outsource their critical regulatory required toxicology and drug disposition activities to us the demand for these services is driven by preclinical development programs for the smaller biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and key safety studies by the larger global pharmaceutical companies because of the necessary investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently conduct and perform these activities we believe that participants in these industries will prefer to focus on their core competencies of innovation early drug discovery and in the case of the larger pharmaceutical companies targeted sales and marketing and thus we believe the demand for our preclinical service offerings will continue to increase 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design execution and reporting of general and specialty toxicology studies especially those dealing with innovative therapies and biologicals we currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the united states canada and europe as a result of increasing demand for outsourced preclinical services we are conducting significant facilities expansions or our preclinical services facilities—one in massachusetts which opened recently and one in nevada at which we expect to begin phasedin occupancy in midsummer 2007 as well as expansions at our ohio and edinburgh pcs facilities the massachusetts and nevada facilities will eventually replace our legacy operations in those venues and when fully built out will more than double the size of the legacy operations our pcs segment represented 51 of our total net sales in 2006 including the reclassified phase i clinical services business and employed 55 of our employees 

we currently offer the following preclinical services in which we include both in vivo and in vitro studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development from inception to proof of concept 

toxicology   toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength once a lead molecule is selected the stage of preclinical development begins where appropriate toxicology studies are conducted to support initial clinical trials our toxicology services feature

·   all the standard protocols for general toxicity testing required for regulatory submissions

·   expertise in specialty routes of administration and modes of administration eg infusion intravitreal administration and inhalation which are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals but also for safety testing of medical devices industrial chemicals food additives agrochemicals nutraceuticals and other materials

·   other services to fully evaluate the genotoxicity safety pharmacology acute subacute chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity potential to support “first in man” to “first on the market” strategies

·   marketleading expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in support of larger scale human clinical trials

·   services in important specialty areas such as developmentalreproductive ocular bone juvenileneonatal and immuno toxicology as well as photobiology and dermal testing

·   work in all major therapeutic areas

·   study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience in support of drug development and

·   a strong history of aiding our sponsors in reaching their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing including studies addressing stem cell therapies dna vaccines recombinant proteins standard small molecules and medical devices

our toxicology facilities operate in compliance with good laboratory practices glps as required by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our facilities are regularly inspected by us and other glp compliance monitoring authorities as well as our own and our customers’ quality assurance departments 

pathology services   in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes within tissues and cells is critical in determining the safety of a new compound we employ highly trained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential compoundrelated changes within tissues and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical for regulatory driven safety studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key “gonogo” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism   in support of preclinical drug safety testing our customers are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated analytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes including oligonucleotide and inhibitory rnas in the event that the sample analysis for preclinical study support translates to opportunities to analyze clinical samples for the same drug once human testing begins we have opportunities to capture the benefits of bridging preclinical bioanalysis with later clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the kinetics pharmacotoxico of the exposure to the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites by radiolabeled techniques our clients require these studies for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound

discovery support   at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the activity of drug candidates in several important therapeutic and support areas including

·   oncology through our tumor xenograft models

·   asthma through our specialized disease model colonies

·   bone disease using our stateoftheart imaging and pathology capabilities

·   ophthalmology using our models of neovascularization

·   general cardiovascular and device testing using our surgical models and

·   early drug formulation and bioanalysis support and method development

we also offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria 

biopharmaceutical services   we provide specialized nonclinical quality control testing that is frequently outsourced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies these services allow our customers to determine if their human protein drug candidates or the processes for manufacturing those products are essentially free of residual biological materials the bulk of this testing is required by the fda in order to obtain new drug approval to maintain an fdalicensed manufacturing facility or to release approved products for use in patients our scientific staff consults with customers in the areas of process development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing

phase i trials in healthy normal and special populations 

the phase i clinical services business represents a growth opportunity for us that initially originated through our acquisition of the clinical services business of inveresk and which we have grown through our acquisition of northwest kinetics in october 2006 combined our capabilities encompass two premier internationally recognized phase i clinics—one in europe edinburgh scotland and the other in north america tacoma washington with a combined capacity of over 300 beds we focus our clinical services business on highend clinical pharmacology studies in healthy participants and in therapeutic areas including cardiovascular oncology ophthalmology respiratory and infectious diseases from a strategic perspective we believe that our clinical services business is positioned to benefit from pullthrough from our preclinical and laboratory services particularly with our biotechnology customers 

we offer a wide range of phase i clinical research services designed to move lead pharmaceutical candidates rapidly from preclinical development through phase i pharmacokinetic tolerability and pharmacodynamic assessment to explore human pharmacology we can conduct studies across a wide range of therapeutic areas and have demonstrated experience in complex dose tolerance radiolabeled pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and bioavailability studies in addition we provide customers with highend “firstinman” studies for novel compounds and expertise in complex drugdrug interaction studies participants at both clinics are evaluated through an intensive screening process to ensure study suitability we employ quality assurance units at these facilities to monitor the conduct and reporting of phase i trials and to assure management that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the premier global company advancing the search for drugs devices and therapies from discovery through proof of concept the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law our business is primarily driven by the continued growth of research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the federal government and academic institutions and of outsourced services according to a report by the biomedical industry advisory group it takes 11 to 16 years and costs in the range of 180 million to 165 billion with an average cost of approximately 900 million to bring a new drug to market as the pressure to develop new drugs increases so does the pressure to contain costs to implement research in multiple countries simultaneously and to identify hire and retain a breadth of scientific and technical experts in order to facilitate and speed their research our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are making strategic decisions to increasingly outsource services which can be provided by highquality service providers like us outsourcing allows our customers to concentrate their internal resources on early drug discovery while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours that can help speed the drug discovery and development process our strategy is to capitalize on these opportunities by continuing to build our portfolio of high end valueadded products and services through internal development augmented by strategic “bolton” transactions 

in today’s business environment we believe there is a particular advantage in being a large global highquality provider of services throughout the drug discovery and development process many of our customers especially large pharmaceutical companies are attracted to tier 1 contract research organizations with a full breadth of capabilities and establish preferred provider relationships with only a small number we are focused on being recognized as a premier preferred provider and maintaining longterm relationships and strategic partnerships with our customers accordingly with many of our largest customers we have entered into global provider agreements that span both segments of our business 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of our products and services primarily through internal development which will be augmented as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances we believe our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing stockholder value this strategy may include geographic expansion of existing core services particularly in asia if the appropriate opportunities present themselves strengthening of one of our core services or the addition of a new product or service in a related or adjacent business 

we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities we intend to focus our marketing efforts on among other things stimulating demand for further outsourcing to gain additional market share to take advantage of promising opportunities which are available to us as a result of continued growth of outsourced services in 2006 we invested heavily in expanding our facilities capacity and we intend to continue the capital expansion activity in 2007 similarly we are investing in our information technology systems and resources in order to better serve our customers harmonize our data and streamline our processes 

customers 

our customers continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies many biotechnology companies animal health medical device diagnostic and other life sciences companies and leading hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have stable longterm relationships with many of our customers during 2006 no single commercial customer accounted for more than 6 of our total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 15 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe asia and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 15 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force the majority of whom work in north america with the balance working in europe and japan our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and japan we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with trade advertising direct mail newsletters and our website the direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors for our products 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we maintain clientcustomer service technical assistance and consulting service departments which address both our customers’ routine and more specialized needs we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical and clinical 

study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is recognized as a valuable customer resource 

competition 

our strategy is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation responsiveness pricing innovation timeliness and availability supported by our strategically located facilities worldwide 

the competitive landscape for our two business segments varies for rms our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america two of whom have a global scope and several smaller competitors in europe and in japan of our main us competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships 

we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world based on net service revenue our commercial competitors for preclinical services consist of both publicly held and privately owned companies the phase i clinical services market is highly fragmented with approximately ten participants both public and private representing the majority of the market and a number of smaller limitedservice providers also providing capacity in addition our pcs segment including our phase i business competes with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical companies and universities and teaching hospitals 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical area of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 30 2006 we had approximately 8000 employees including approximately 330 science professionals with advanced degrees including dvms phds and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our annual satisfaction surveys indicate that we have an excellent relationship with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for our pcs business segment was approximately 341 million at december 30 2006 we do not report backlog for the rms segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid our preclinical services including phase i clinical services are performed over varying durations from short to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a customer’s intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2006 backlog may be completed in 2007 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating segments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments as described below 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which excludes rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs portions of our preclinical business are also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our pcs business conducts nonclinical laboratory safety studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world the conduct of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which 

nonclinical laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom health canada and the japanese ministry of health and welfare glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our pcs business also conducts human phase i clinical trials and provides services in support of our clients’ registration or licensing applications human clinical trials are conducted in a progressive fashion beginning with phase i and in the case of approved drugs continued through phase iv trials phase i studies are the initial human clinical trials and are conducted with a small number of subjects under highly controlled conditions these clinical trials and services are performed in accordance with the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practice consolidated guidance and in compliance with regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human clinical trial subjects in the united states these trials and services must comply with fda regulations and in europe our clinical trials and services must comply with the clinical trials directive of the european union neither fda regulations nor the clinical trials directive requires a quality assurance program however each of our phase i facilities has an established quality assurance unit that monitors the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements our manufacturing business produces endotoxin test kits and reagents and vaccine support products additionally the analytical divisions of several of our nonclinical laboratories conduct stability and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and mhra under their respective good manufacturing practice regulations or the fda’s quality systems regulation manufacturing of medical devices we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products in a prescribed manner with respect to and maintain records of our manufacturing testing and control activities 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions

 item 1a   risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k we note that factors set forth below individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past several years some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities we believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services by doing so they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery while obtaining the outsourced services from a fullservice provider like us while industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a decrease in preclinical andor clinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability our operations and financial results could be significantly affected these risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the united states strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

in recent years the us congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any similar reform movements have occurred in europe and asia 

implementation of health care reform legislation that contains costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings 

our standard customer agreements contain liberal termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may 

elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested the customer’s decision to forego or terminate a particular study or the loss of funding for the particular research study if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business particularly our preclinical services segment and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control or we may under price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting in financial losses 

many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or feeforservice with a cap basis and accordingly we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates in addition these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons including often upon the discretion of the customer the loss reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventious infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including transgenic services harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting this cleanup results in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments in addition contaminations expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements these contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries represented 502 of our total net sales in 2006 498 of our total net sales in 2005 and 316 in 2004 we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

·   foreign currencies we receive for sales outside the united states could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue that we recognize

·   general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate

·   potential international conflicts including terrorist acts

·   potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures

·   potential trade restrictions exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states

·   difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of violations of local laws or the us foreign corrupt practices act by employees oversees or the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions

·   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

·   the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations

·   unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions

·   longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and

·   import and export licensing requirements

in particular with respect to our operations in canada and the united kingdom significant amounts of revenues and expenses are recorded in local nonus currency our financial statements are presented in us dollars accordingly changes in currency exchange rates particularly between the pound sterling the canadian dollar the european euro and the us dollar will cause fluctuations in our reported financial results which could be material in addition our contracts with foreign customers are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts this is particularly the case with respect to our canadian operations where contracts generally provide for invoicing clients in us dollars but its expenses are generally incurred in canadian dollars where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interests groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention impacting the industry this has included occasional but infrequent onsite demonstrations at facilities operated by us any negative attention or threats directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups our business could be materially adversely affected 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large animal models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from colony fertility and health problems export or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions disruptions to the air travel system or contract disputes or disruptions any disruption 

of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

we may be unable to build out our facilities as anticipated 

to support our customers’ growing demand for drug discovery and development services including increased strategic focus on outsourcing services and programs we are engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program with 182 million spent on capital expenditures in 2006 and another 200—225 million allocated for capital expenditures in 2007 included in our 2007 capital plan are the following our new us preclinical services facility in nevada at which we expect to begin phasedin occupancy in midsummer 2007 expansions at our ohio and edinburgh preclinical facilities and an expansion of our rms california capabilities approximately half of which is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2007 we cannot assure you that any or all of these facilities or any particular phase of such facilities will be constructed on the anticipated timetable or on budget any material delay in bringing these facilities online or substantial increase in costs to complete these facilities could materially and adversely affect us 

any failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results 

any failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from participants in connection with a particular phase i clinical trial the data collected from that trial could be disqualified and we might be required to redo the trial at no further cost to our customer but at substantial cost to us furthermore the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies but also with internal discovery and development departments within our clients who are often large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals we compete on a variety of factors including 

·   reputation for ontime quality performance and regulatory compliance

·   expertise and experience in specific areas

·   scope of service and product offerings

·   strengths in various geographic markets

·   price

·   technological expertise and efficient drug development processes

·   quality of facilities

·   ability to acquire process analyze and report data in an accurate manner

·   ability to manage clinical trials both domestically and internationally and

·   size

if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation particularly among the biotechnology companies if this trend continues it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and contract research organizations generally for both clients and acquisition candidates in addition small limitedservice entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will continue to find few barriers to entry thus further increasing possible competition these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in the united kingdom or canada 

we have substantial operations in the united kingdom and canada which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and benefits from tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or allowances would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits and cash flow from either or both of our canadian and united kingdom operations and on our effective tax rate 

impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations 

we accounted for our acquisition of inveresk as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states under the purchase method of accounting the assets and liabilities of inveresk including identifiable intangible assets have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the date the acquisition was completed the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill as a result of our acquisitions we have recorded 11 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets 

during fiscal 2006 we sold our phase iiiv clinical services business segment which we had acquired in the inveresk transaction for approximately 215 million in cash as part of a portfolio realignment which would allow us to capitalize on our core competencies accordingly during 2006 we performed a goodwill impairment test for the clinical services business segment and determined that the book carrying value of goodwill assigned to our clinical services business segment exceeded its implied fair value we therefore recorded a 1292 million charge to writedown the value of this goodwill 

the remaining goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment by us at least annually if the future growth and operating results of the acquired businesses are not as strong as anticipated goodwill may be impaired to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

in contracting to work on drug development trials as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include 

·   errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical or phase i clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support

·   litigation risk including resulting from our errors or omissions associated with the possibility that the drugs of our clients that were included in drug development trials we participated in may cause illness personal injury or have other negative side effects to clinical study participants or other persons including death

·   general risks associated with operating a phase i business including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers

·   risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers’ property such as research models and samples while in our possession

·   risks that models in our breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals and

·   errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial

we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

in our rms business we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regiment of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections 

in our preclinical businesses we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients investigators and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

in both our rms and preclinical services businesses contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to attract suitable participants for our clinical trials our business might suffer 

the clinical research studies we run rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of subjects participants generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted including our phase i clinics in edinburgh scotland and tacoma washington which to date has provided a substantial pool of potential subjects for research studies our phase i clinical research activities could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing participants on a consistent basis 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research some companies have developed techniques in these areas including vaccine development that may have scientific merit it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets however we may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns whether we win or lose if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 

at december 30 2006 we had approximately 5721 million of debt this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

during the past six years we have expanded our business through several acquisitions we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing the transaction even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

·   difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations services products or technologies

·   difficulties in developing and operating new businesses including diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns

·   potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller

·   risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies

·   the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies and

·   difficulties in achieving business and financial success

in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems 

we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of customer data as a routine element of our business we collect analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical and the clinical studies we conduct for our customers unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems we believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm our contracts with our customers typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised we could suffer significant harm 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for 30 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our management if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements the commencement postponement completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter changes in the mix of our products and services the extent of cost overruns holiday patterns of our customers budget cycles of our customers and exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily 

a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

continuing operations 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process including research models and associated services and outsourced preclinical services which include phase i clinical services we partner with global pharmaceutical companies a wide range of biotechnology companies as well as government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world in order to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development we currently operate over 80 facilities in 15 countries worldwide 

we have been in business for 60 years we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of services which address drug discovery and development in the preclinical arena including phase i clinical studies 

we report two segments research models and services rms and preclinical services pcs which reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed when we divested the clinical phase iiiv business in the third quarter of 2006 we retained our phase i clinical services business as an integral strategic component of our service offerings which enables us to support our customers’ preclinical efforts through earlystage clinical trials the phase i clinical services results are included in the pcs segment 

our sales growth in 2006 was driven by spending by major pharmaceuticals  biotechnology companies and academic institutions on our global products and services which aid in their development of new drugs and products this growth in revenues was partially offset by customer focus on costsavings future drivers for our business as a whole are primarily expected to emerge from our customers’ continued growing demand for drug discovery and development services including increased strategic focus on outsourcing which should drive future sales of services 

we expect our continuing capacity expansion program to position us to take advantage of these longterm opportunities in 2006 we began major construction at our preclinical sites in massachusetts and nevada which are planned to open in early and mid2007 respectively other significant projects include expanding our california rms capabilities building of a facility in maryland which will support the national cancer institute nci contract we were awarded in late 2006 as well as additional rms capacity and additional preclinical capacity in ohio and scotland our capital expenditures of over 180 million in 2006 and our planned capital expenditures in the range of 200 million to 225 million in 2007 reflect our ongoing commitment to this strategy 

in addition to internally generated organic growth our business strategy includes strategic “bolton” acquisitions that complement our business and increase the rate of our growth as reflected in our acquisition in late 2006 of northwest kinetics a phase i clinical services business to augment our existing european phase i clinic in edinburgh scotland 

our overall results for 2006 were significantly affected by the implementation of sfas 123r expensing of stock options which we adopted on a modified prospective application transition method in the first quarter of 2006 the additional cost associated with stock option expense was 117 million 

total net sales in 2006 were 11 billion an increase of 65 over the same period last year the sales increase was due primarily to increased customer demand and higher pricing the effect of foreign currency translation was negligible our gross margin decreased to 384 of net sales compared to 392 

of net sales for 2005 due primarily to stock compensation expense and lower margins in the rms segment stock compensation expense for 2006 is set forth in the following chart

total stock compensation expense 

 

  

operating income for the year was 1882 million compared to 1847 million for 2005 the operating margin was 178 compared to 186 for the prior year our 2006 operating margin rate was unfavorably impacted by 117 million 11 due to the additional cost associated with expensing stock options under sfas 123r although the negative effect was partially offset by improved margins in the pcs business 

net income from continuing operations was 1252 million in 2006 compared to 1458 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2006 were 179 compared to 202 in 2005 

our rms segment which represented 487 of net sales in 2006 includes sales of research models transgenic services laboratory services preconditioning services consulting and staffing services vaccine support and in vitro technology primarily endotoxin testing net sales for this segment increased 24 compared to 2005 due to increased research model production and in vitro sales partially offset by lower large model and transgenic sales as well as reduced spending by certain of our large pharmaceutical customers unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased the net sales gain by 04 we experienced declines in both the rms gross margin and operating margin to 416 from 428 and to 287 from 318 respectively mainly due to the impact of stock option expense and the impact of lower large model and transgenic sales during 2006 we began construction to expand capacity in our northern california production facility to meet our west coast customers’ increased need for models preconditioning services and valueadded model characterization services for their drug discovery and development efforts we expect to begin production in approximately onehalf of this addition in the second quarter of 2007 preconditioning services presents a significant opportunity for future growth therefore we intend to 

dedicate space at our major breeding facilities over the next few years to support our customers’ expected increased use of outsourced preconditioning services 

our preclinical services segment which represented 513 of net sales in 2006 includes services required to take a drug through the development process including discovery support toxicology pathology biopharmaceutical bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services as well as phase i clinical trials sales for this segment increased 109 over 2005 we experienced favorable market conditions as demand for toxicology services particularly remained strong unfavorable foreign currency decreased sales growth by 07 the gross margin for preclinical services remained essentially flat at 354 in 2006 due primarily to the negative impact of the stock compensation expense offset by increased capacity utilization the operating margin increased to 152 of net sales compared to 139 of net sales in 2005 due mainly to lower amortization expense which was partially offset by the stock compensation expense we expect to see increasing levels of customer demand in certain of our development services businesses particularly large model reproductive and inhalation toxicology we continue to focus on meeting the growing demand for our preclinical services and increased outsourcing trends through our expansion program in 2006 we began major construction at our preclinical sites in massachusetts and nevada which are planned to open in early and mid2007 respectively in addition in 2007 we plan construction on new capacity in edinburgh scotland and ohio which we expect will be online in 2008 

discontinued operations 

our former phase iiiv clinical services and our interventional and surgical services iss businesses are reported as discontinued operations our historical information has been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations 

during fiscal 2006 the company initiated actions to sell and sold phase iiiv of our clinical business accordingly management performed appropriate goodwill impairment and asset impairment tests for the clinical business segment as a result we recorded charges of 1292 million to write down the value of the goodwill associated with the clinical business additionally the company made a decision to close its iss business which was formerly included in the pcs segment 

net income loss from discontinued operations for 2006 was 1810 million which included the goodwill impairment of 1292 million the tax expense of 378 million related to the sale of the phase iiiv clinical business as well as results from our iss business 

net income 

net income loss for 2006 was 558 million compared to 1420 million in 2005 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management believes the following critical accounting policies are most affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates reflect our more significant judgments and estimates than usual in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement 

·   goodwill and other intangible assets

·   revenue recognition

·   pension plan accounting and

·   income taxes and deferred tax assets

goodwill other intangible assets   we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to the acquisition of businesses we acquired the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition require significant management judgments and estimates these estimates are made based on among others input from an accredited valuation consultant reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations

we perform an annual review of goodwill to determine if an impairment exists goodwill is considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units our evaluation includes management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment our market capitalization was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis we performed annual impairment tests in 2006 and concluded the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset balances were not impaired as of december 30 2006 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 13 billion in the consolidated balance sheet the results of this year’s impairment review is as of a point in time and changes in future business strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these assets in subsequent years 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue on product and services sales we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreedupon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts revenue of agreedupon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based on rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in relation to estimated costs to complete procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols our fixed fee service contracts which are utilized mainly in our preclinical segment vary in term from a few days to greater than a year with the majority of such contracts having a term of less than six months on a monthly basis management reviews the costs incurred and services provided to date on these contracts in relation to the total estimated effort to complete the contract as a result of the monthly reviews revisions in estimated effort to complete the contract are reflected in the period in which the change became known these judgments and estimates are not expected to result in a change that would materially effect our reported results in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these 

advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the customer with the offset to unbilled receivable as of december 30 2006 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 494 million and deferred revenue of 932 million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts 

pension plan accounting   as of december 30 2006 we had a pension liability of 496 million the actuarial computations require the use of assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 30 2006 the weighted average discount rate for our pension plans was 495

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the assets allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years during 2006 based on our most recent analysis of historical and projected returns we lowered our expected return on plan assets resulting in a weighted average return of 658 from 728 the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase or decrease pension expense by 16 million annually 

income taxes and deferred tax assets   as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet in certain cases we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position or results of operations

as of december 30 2006 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 2159 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this undistributed foreign income 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in rates or in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes that we anticipate to change these changes could result in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities around the world due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our business operations we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential 

tax obligations around the world we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits

liquidity and capital resources 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations the convertible debt offering proceeds from the sale of our phase iiiv clinical business and our revolving line of credit arrangements 

on july 31 2006 we amended and restated our thenexisting credit agreement to reduce the current interest rate modify certain restrictive covenants and extend the term the now 4280 million credit agreement provides for a 1560 million us term loan facility a 2000 million us revolving facility a c578 million term loan facility and a c120 million revolving facility for a canadian subsidiary and a gbp 60 million revolving facility for a uk subsidiary the 4280 million credit agreement the 1560 million term loan facility matures in 20 quarterly installments with the last installment due june 30 2011 the 2000 million us revolving facility matures on july 31 2011 and requires no scheduled payment before that date under specified circumstances the 2000 million us revolving facility may be increased by 1000 million the canadian term loan is repayable in full by june 30 2011 and requires no scheduled prepayment before that date the canadian and uk revolving facilities mature on july 31 2011 and require no scheduled prepayment before that date the interest rate applicable to the canadian term loan and the canadian and uk revolving loans under the credit agreement is the adjusted libor rate in its relevant currency plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio based on our leverage ratio the margin range for libor based loans is 0625 to 0875 the interest rate margin was 075 as of december 30 2006 the company has pledged the stock of certain subsidiaries as well as certain us assets as security for the 4280 million credit agreement the 4280 million credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties negative and affirmative covenants and events of default the company had 54 million and 50 million outstanding under letters of credit as of december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively 

as of december 30 2006 there was no outstanding balance on the revolving facility 

we are also party to a 50 million credit agreement which was entered into on july 27 2005 and which was subsequently amended on december 20 2005 and again on july 31 2006 to reflect substantially the same modifications made to the covenants in the 428 million credit agreement the 50 million credit agreement provides for a 50 million term loan facility which matures on july 27 2007 and can be extended for an additional 7 years the interest rates applicable to term loans under this credit agreement are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus ½ or the libor rate plus 075 the 50 million credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties negative and affirmative covenants and events of default 

as of december 30 2006 the entire balance of the 500 million credit agreement was outstanding 

on june 12 2006 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes the 2013 notes in a private placement with net proceeds to the company of 3430 million the 2013 notes bear interest at 225 per annum payable semiannually and mature on june 15 2013 the 2013 notes are convertible into cash and shares of common stock or at the company’s election cash in lieu of some or all of such common stock based on an initial conversion rate subject to adjustment of 204337 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of 4894 per share 

concurrently with the sale of the 2013 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our obligation to deliver common stock under the 2013 notes the convertible note hedges give us the right to receive for no additional consideration the numbers of shares of common stock that we are obligated to deliver upon conversion of the 2013 notes subject to antidilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2013 notes and expire on june 15 2013 the aggregate cost of these convertible note hedges was 983 million 

separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 2013 notes we issued warrants for approximately 72 million shares of our common stock the warrants give the holders the right to receive for no additional consideration cash or shares at our option with a value equal to the appreciation in the price of our shares above 59925 and expire between september 13 2013 and january 22 2014 over 90 equal increments the total proceeds from the issuance of the warrants were 654 million 

from an economic perspective the cumulative impact of the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants increases the effective conversion price of the 2013 notes from 4894 to 5925 per share 

in august 2006 we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase asr program with a thirdparty investment bank in connection with this asr program we initially purchased 1787706 shares of stock at a cost of 75 million in conjunction with the asr we also entered into a cashless collar with a forward floor price of 379576 per share of our common stock 95 of the initial price of 399554 the market price of our common stock on august 23 2006 and a forward cap price of 419532 per share of our common stock 105 of the initial price the final number of shares repurchased under the asr program was 1787706 and was determined by taking the average volume weighted average price of our common stock for 65 trading days which resulted in a final share price of 426503 per share since the final share price of 426503 was above the cap price of 419532 there was no adjustment to the final number of shares repurchased 

in november 2006 the company entered into a new rule 10b51 stock purchase plan with a thirdparty investment bank for the remaining 386 million authorized under our share repurchase program 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 1754 million at december 30 2006 compared to 1148 million at december 31 2005 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 and 2005 was 1760 million and 2168 million respectively the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and deferred income our days sales outstanding increased to 39 days as of december 30 2006 from 33 days as of december 31 2005 due mainly to reduced deferred revenue our days sales outstanding includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation 

net cash used in investing activities in 2006 and 2005 was 2974 million and 1130 million respectively our capital expenditures in 2006 were 1817 million of which 270 million was related to rms and 1547 million to preclinical services for 2007 we project capital expenditures to be in the range of 200  225 million we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by operating activities and existing credit facilities 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was 56 million and cash used in financing activities in 2005 was 1952 million during 2006 we received proceeds of 4403 million of longterm debt partially offset by our purchase of 2500 million of treasury stock and our repayment of debt of 1709 million during 2005 we repaid 3373 million of our debt partially offset by additional borrowing of 1337 million 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 30 2006 are as follows 

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the conversion features of our 2013 notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity therefore these instruments meet the scope of exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities” and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” sfas 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value sets out framework for measuring fair value and expands on required disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for us on january 1 2008 and will be applied prospectively the provisions of sfas 157 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” as of december 30 2006 this statement requires employers that sponsor defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on its balance sheet recognize gains losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend balance sheet and disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 due to diversity in practice among registrants sab 108 expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 and early application is encouraged we have applied the provisions of sab 108 in the third quarter of 2006 which had an immaterial impact on selling general and administrative expense and tax expense which resulted in a positive impact of 001 on our earnings per share in the statement of operations 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fas no 109 fin 48 which clarifi es the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes currently the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is subject to significant and varied interpretations that have resulted in diverse and inconsistent accounting practices and measurements addressing such diversity fin 48 prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing derecognizing 

and measuring changes in such tax positions for financial statement purposes fin 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 is effective for fi scal years beginning after december 15 2006 we have evaluated the interpretation and have determined the impact of fin 48 will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points from levels at december 30 2006 then the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately 03 million 

we have entered into two credit agreements the 428 million credit agreement prior to july 31 2006 the 660 million credit agreement and the 50 million credit agreement our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans in the 428 million credit agreement and in the 50 million agreement and our revolving credit facilities our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 48 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of our foreign operations’ revenue is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate certain transactions as hedges as set forth in sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” 

during 2006 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items no material foreign exchange contracts were outstanding on december 30 2006

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process we provide the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for more than 58 years for over a decade we have built upon our core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science research model technologies 

to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug discovery and development our customer base includes major pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies as well as many government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world we currently operate over 100 facilities in 21 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research a large and growing market in 2005 our net sales were 112 billion and our operating income was 1810 million 

in october 2004 we acquired inveresk research group inc prior to the acquisition inveresk was a publicly traded company and a leading provider of drug development services to companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries through its preclinical and clinical business segments it offered a broad range of drug development services including preclinical safety and pharmacology evaluation services laboratory sciences services and clinical development services much of our activities in 2005 has focused upon the integration of inveresk which has included unifying our products and services under the “charles river” brand name and the harmonizing of best practices derived from the combination of the two companies

the acquisition has broadened our portfolio of highend products and services including general toxicology specialty toxicology and clinical services overall the addition of inveresk has impacted our company dramatically as follows 

·   significantly expanded our overall corporate size

·   significantly increased the breadth of the products and services that we offer including those that are highly complementary to the services charles river had previously offered and

·   expanded and strengthened our global footprint in the growing market for pharmaceutical research and development products and services particularly in key markets such as the united states europe and japan which better aligns us with our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers who are increasingly seeking to outsource more of their preclinical and clinical research and development efforts and are seeking full service global partners

as part of the integration of inveresk’s business operations in 2004 we changed our business reporting segments to better reflect our results of operations and facilitate understanding of our business which has evolved since 1999 from a productoriented focus to a serviceoriented one we currently have three reporting segments research models and services rms preclinical services which is a combination of inveresk’s preclinical business with our legacy preclinical business and clinical services 

research models and services rms 

with over 150 different stocks and strains we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice and have been supplying research models since 1947 we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in supporting the use of research models in drug development with 20 facilities on three continents north america europe and asia japan we maintain production centers including approximately 160 barrier rooms strategically located near our customers in addition we anticipate expanding our existing us west coast capacity with additional construction which will partially open in the fourth quarter of 2006 in 2005 rms accounted for 448 of total net sales and approximately 35 of our employees including more than 160 science professionals with advanced degrees 

research models   a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of animal research models principally purposebred rats mice and other rodents for use by 

researchers we provide our small animal models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies major biotechnology companies many government agencies and leading hospital and academic institutions our research models include genetically defined models and models with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as earlystage research tools the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates and many medical devices to be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process 

our rats mice and other rodent species have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality in the breeding process our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the animals are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our barrier room production capabilities we are able to deliver consistently high quality research models worldwide 

our small research models include 

·   outbred animals which are genetically heterogeneous

·   inbred animals which are genetically identical

·   hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents

·   spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturallyoccurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and

·   other genetically modified research models including knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic animals which contain genetic material transferred from a different species

since 2001 we have been offering new and proprietary diseasespecific rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease we are presently focusing our disease model program on four areas of research cardiovascular metabolic renal and oncology which in addition to providing overlapping disease modalities that support multiple uses of certain models also will permit us to concentrate on focused sales and marketing efforts 

we believe that over the next several years many new research models will be developed and used in biomedical research such as transgenic models with modified genetic material knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models that incorporate or exclude a particular gene these more highly defined and characterized models will allow researchers to further focus their investigations into disease conditions and potential new therapies or interventions we intend to build upon our position as a leader in this field to expand our presence in this market for highervalue research models 

in addition to our small research models we also are a global leader in providing purposebred high quality spf or disease free large animal models to the biomedical research community principally for use in their drug development and testing studies 

we also provide surgical services to our customers utilizing over 50 fulltime staff surgical technicians located in the united states europe and commencing in 2006 asia this valueadded service offering enhances the basic research model by allowing for repeated sample collection in the case of catheterized animals 

rms also offers a variety of services described below designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates faster including those which are related to genetically defined research models for inhouse research as well as those services designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the customer’s drug evaluation process these services address the growing need among pharmaceutical and 

biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business we currently offer three major categories of research models services—transgenic services laboratory services and preconditioning and surgical services we also offer three other categories of products and services—consulting and staffing services vaccine support and in vitro technology products 

transgenic services   in this area of our business we assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing research models purchased or created by them for biomedical research activities while the creation of a transgenic model can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of research models requires significant additional technical expertise we provide transgenic breeding expertise model characterization including genotyping and phenotyping and colony development quarantine embryo cryopreservation embryo transfer and health and genetic monitoring we provide these services to nearly 200 laboratories around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities and maintain more than 1000 different types of naturally occurring or experimentally manipulated research models for our customers

laboratory services   we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customer’s needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in model development and characterization and utilization of specific disease models and genetically engineered models will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for health and genetic testing of laboratory animals

preconditioning and surgical services   augmenting our traditional model production and transgenic services described above we believe there are emerging opportunities to provide customers with preconditioning services which centers upon speeding the development process by preparing studyready research models possessing necessary characteristics our veterinary medicine expertise makes us well positioned to create and monitor the research models for such studies such as those focused upon obesity or hypertension additionally models of subclinical disease can be created through surgical approaches thereby providing a model for study that otherwise may not be commercially available

consulting and staffing services   building upon our core capability as the leading provider of highquality research models we manage animal care operations on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers demand for our services reflects the growing necessity of these large institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to the core scientific innovation process or for which they do not maintain the necessary resources inhouse in addition we believe that our expertise in animal care and facility operations enhances the productivity and quality of our customers’ animal care and use programs this area leads to additional opportunities for us to provide other products and services to our customers

vaccine support   we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live and inactivated viruses these viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence that includes several spf egg production facilities in the united states as well as facilities in germany and australia and a joint venture in mexico we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse testing and support services to our customers

in vitro technology   our in vitro business provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs we are committed to being the leader in providing our 

customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible and toward that goal we work with and support the european center for validation of alternative methods in these efforts our in vitro technology business produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for medical devices and other products worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing which is used for quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes by which they are manufactured quality control testing for endotoxin contamination is an fda requirement for injectable drugs and medical devices endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and only major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test for endotoxin detection in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing the process of extracting blood is generally not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment our endosafe portable testing system endosafe ®  pts is a portable endotoxin testing platform which allows endotoxin testing in the field affording researchers accurate and timely results we are currently pursuing fda approval of our pts system we are also investigating expanding the use of the pts system for endotoxin testing into other markets such as nuclear pharmacies cell transplant dentistsdoctors offices dialysis clinics testing for sterile water and even environmental testing as well as other ways to invest in the pts platform such as through additional biological assays

preclinical services 

our customers are principally engaged in the discovery and development of new drugs devices and therapies discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences directed to the identification screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery activities typically last anywhere from 46 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines development activities which follow are directed at demonstrating the safety tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates during the preclinical stage of the development process a drug candidate is tested in vitro typically on a cellular or subcellular level in a test tube or multiwell petri plate and in vivo in research models to support planned or ongoing human trials the development services portion of our preclinical business segment enables our customers to outsource their critical regulatoryrequired toxicology and drug disposition activities to us the demand for these services is driven by preclinical development programs for the smaller biotechnology companies which traditionally have been outsourced and key safety studies by the larger multinational pharmaceutical companies because of the necessary investments in personnel facilities and other capital resources required in order to efficiently partake in these activities we believe that participants in these industries will prefer to focus on their core competencies of innovation early drug discovery and in the case of the larger pharmaceutical companies targeted sales and marketing and thus we believe the demand for our preclinical service offerings will continue to increase 

we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services worldwide and are considered by many of our clients as market leaders in the conduct and reporting of general and specialty toxicology studies especially those dealing with innovative therapies and biologicals we currently provide preclinical services at 12 facilities in the united states canada and europe with inveresk we acquired highquality full research capability laboratories in montreal canada and edinburgh scotland and by the end of 2006 we expect to have initial occupancy of a new facility in massachusetts followed in 2007 by a fourth fullcapability research facility in nevada our preclinical services segment represented 435 of our total net sales in 2005 and employs over 4000 or almost half of our employees 

we currently offer preclinical services in which we include both in vivo and in vitro studies supportive laboratory services and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development from inception to market registration 

toxicology   once a lead molecule is selected the stage of preclinical development begins where appropriate toxicology studies are conducted to support initial clinical trials we offer all the standard models for general toxicity testing in the species typically required for regulatory submissions but we also have particular expertise in specialty routes of administration modes of administration eg infusion intravitreal administration and inhalation this is important not only for pharmaceuticals but also for safety testing of medical devices industrial chemicals food additives agrochemicals nutraceuticals and other materials toxicology is clearly one of our core competencies and strengths we offer services to fully evaluate the genotoxicity safety pharmacology acute subacute chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity potential to support “first in man” to “first on the market” strategies in support of larger scale human clinical trials we believe that we are a world leader in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies we also offer services in important specialty areas like immunotoxicology photobiology ocular and dermal testing we have worked with all major therapeutic areas and provide study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience in drug development we have a strong history of aiding our sponsors in reaching their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing including studies addressing stem cell therapies dna vaccines recombinant proteins standard small molecules and medical devices within the requirements for preclinical safety testing are compliance with good laboratory practices glps as outlined by the fda as well as other international regulatory bodies our toxicology facilities operate in compliance with glp requirements and are regularly inspected by us and other glp compliance monitoring authorities as well as our own and our customers’ quality assurance departments

pathology services   in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes within tissues and cells is critical in determining the safety of a new compound we employ highly trained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify potential compoundrelated changes within tissues and cells as well as at the molecular level pathology support is critical for regulatorydriven safety studies but also for specialized investigative studies discovery support and standalone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies key gonogo decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients

bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism   in support of preclinical drug safety testing our customers are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure stability in the collected sample kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation the presence of metabolites and with recombinant proteins and peptides the presence of antidrug antibodies we have scientific depth in the sophisticated analytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes including oligonucleotide and inhibitory rnas in the event that the sample analysis for preclinical study support translates to opportunities to analyze clinical samples for the same drug once human testing begins we have opportunities to capture the benefits of bridging preclinical bioanalysis with later clinical development once the analysis is complete our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the kinetics pharmacotoxico of the exposure to the drug as well as complete evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites by radiolabeled techniques these studies are needed for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound

discovery support   at the earliest stages of lead compound identification our scientists are engaged in evaluating the activity of drug candidates in several important therapeutic and support areas including oncology through our tumor xenograft models asthma through our specialized animal disease models bone disease using our state of the art imaging and pathology capabilities ophthalmology using our models of neovascularization general cardiovascular and device testing using our surgical models and early drug formulation and bioanalysis support and method development we offer lead optimization strategies including early pharmacokinetic metabolism and toxicology support to help in early integrative drug selection criteria

biopharmaceutical services   we provide specialized nonclinical quality control testing that is frequently outsourced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies these services allow our customers to determine if their human protein drug candidates or the processes for manufacturing those products are essentially free of residual biological materials the bulk of this testing work is required by the fda in order to obtain new drug approval to maintain an fdalicensed manufacturing facility or to release approved products for use in patients our scientific staff consults with customers in the areas of process development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing

the clinical services business represents a relatively new market and growth opportunity for us that originated through our acquisition of the phase iiv business of inveresk our capabilities includes a premier phase i clinic in europe and an established international capability to manage phase iiiv studies our clinical development business presently employs approximately 940 people and operates in 24 countries from 17 facilities located across north america europe south america asia and australia in 2005 the clinical services segment accounted for approximately 116 of our total net sales we are focused upon maintaining healthy profit margins in this segment through careful positioning of our clinical services including our core therapeutic areas of cardiovascular oncology ophthalmology respiratory and infectious diseases from a strategic perspective we believe that our clinical services business is positioned to benefit from pullthrough from our preclinical and laboratory services particularly with our biotechnology customers 

phase i trials in patients and special populations 

we operate a 62bed clinic in edinburgh scotland at which we conduct a wide range of phase i clinical trials designed to move lead pharmaceutical candidates rapidly from preclinical development through phase i tolerability assessment to explore human pharmacology this facility is in close proximity to one of our laboratory sciences facilities which is responsible for performing the analysis of biological samples generated by our phase i clinic facilitating fast response times our phase i clinic which focuses on “firstinman” studies is capable of conducting all types of studies and has experience across a wide range of therapeutic areas including complex dose tolerance radiolabeled pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and bioavailability studies all of the clinic’s volunteers are evaluated through an intensive screening process to ensure study suitability the facility has an established quality assurance unit that monitors the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure management that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements 

phase iiiv clinical development and regulatory support 

from our 14 offices worldwide and business operations in more than 20 countries we manage every aspect of clinical trials from clinical development plans and protocol design to new drug applications ndas and postmarketing surveillance we provide a comprehensive range of services as either a fullservice package or as individual standalone services in addition to conducting single site studies in many parts of the world we have a proven track record of managing large international multicenter trials 

culminating in regulatory filings we have supported studies in over 34 countries our clinical trials management services include 

   

we also have significant expertise in conducting patient and other outcomes registries such as pregnancy registries on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry as well as regulatory support before a product may be launched in any country it must be approved by the regulatory agency in that particular country we offer comprehensive global regulatory product registration services at all stages of development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and have particular expertise with the regulations in europe and north america through this service we assist our clients in determining the feasibility of developing a particular product or product line 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the premier global company for advancing the search for drugs devices and therapies from discovery through market approval the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law our business is primarily driven by the continued growth of research and development spending by pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies the federal government and academic institutions and of outsourced services according to a recent report by the biomedical industry advisory group it takes 11 to 16 years and costs in the range of 180 million to 165 billion to bring a new drug to market as the pressure to develop new drugs increases for these industries so does the pressure to contain costs implement research in multiple countries simultaneously and identify hire and retain a breadth of experienced experts in order to facilitate and speed their research our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers have increasingly strategically outsourced services which can be provided by highquality service providers like charles river outsourcing allows our customers to concentrate their resources on the basic drug discovery which only they can do while continuing to advance their most promising products through the development pipeline this creates opportunities for companies such as ours that can help speed the drug discovery and development process our strategy is to capitalize on these opportunities by continuing to build our portfolio of high end valueadded products and services through internal development augmented by strategic “bolton” transactions 

in today’s business environment we particularly believe there is an advantage in being a large global highquality provider of services throughout the drug discovery and development process many of our customers especially large pharmaceutical companies are attracted to tier 1 contract research organizations with a full breadth of capabilities and establish preferred provider agreements with only a small handful we are focused on being recognized as a premier preferred provider and maintaining longterm relationships and strategic partnerships with our customers accordingly with many of our largest customers we have entered into global provider agreements that span two or three segments of our business 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of our products and services primarily through organic growth which will be augmented as needed through focused acquisitions and alliances we believe our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing stockholder value this strategy may include geographic 

expansion of existing core services strengthening of one of our core services or the addition of a new product or service 

we believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities we intend to focus our marketing efforts on stimulating demand for further outsourcing to gain additional market share to take advantage of promising opportunities which are available to us as a result of continued growth of outsourced services in 2006 we anticipate investing heavily in expanding our facilities capacity 

customers 

our customers continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies as well as many biotechnology companies animal health medical device and diagnostic companies leading hospitals academic institutions government agencies and other life sciences companies recently as a result of the inveresk merger and outsourcing trends our commercial customer base mainly pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies has grown at a higher rate than our noncommercial customer rate we have many longterm stable relationships with our customers during 2005 no single commercial customer accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please see note 15 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states europe asia and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 15 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force the majority of whom work in the united states with the balance working in europe and japan our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia publishing scientific papers making presentations and participating at scientific conferences and trade shows in north america europe and japan we supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with trade advertising direct mail newsletters and our web site the direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors for our products 

our internal marketingproduct management teams support the field sales staff while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we maintain customer service technical assistance and consulting service departments which address both our customers’ routine and more specialized needs we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity preclinical and clinical study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is recognized as a valuable customer resource 

research and development 

while there is some research and development activity involved in our in vitro technologies business we do not maintain a fully dedicated research and development staff and therefore have not had any significant research and development costs in any of the past three fiscal years our approach to developing new products or services is to extend our base technologies into new applications and fields and in some instances to license or acquire technologies to serve as platforms for the development of new businesses that service our existing customer base our research and development focus is principally on developing projects that improve our productivity or processes 

industry support and animal welfare 

one of our core values is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to demonstrate our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical area of our business we created our own humane care initiative which is directed by our animal welfare and training group the goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of lifesaving drugs and procedures we work handinhand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions handling procedures and stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research as animal caregivers and researchers we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8400 employees including approximately 450 science professionals with advanced degrees including dvms phds and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local customs for our industry our annual satisfaction surveys indicate that we have an excellent relationship with our employees 

backlog 

our backlog for preclinical services and clinical services was approximately 4482 million at december 31 2005 we do not report backlog for the rms segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment both for products and services is rapid our preclinical and clinical services are performed over varying times from a short period of time to extended periods of time which may be as long as several years we maintain an order backlog for these segments to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed we only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a customer’s intention to proceed we do not recognize verbal orders cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog 

we believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily an indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons first studies vary in duration ie some studies that are included in 2005 backlog may be completed in 2006 while others may be completed in later years second the scope of studies may change which may either increase or decrease their value third studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments fourth studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities terminations or delays can result from a number of reasons delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue modify or cancel the study has been made we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year 

competition 

our strategy is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation responsiveness timeliness and availability supported by our international presence with strategically located facilities 

the competitive landscape for our three business segments varies for rms our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america several smaller competitors in europe and two smaller competitors in japan of our main us competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships 

we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world based on net service revenue our commercial competitors for preclinical services are both publiclyheld and privatelyowned companies the clinical development services market is highly fragmented with participants ranging from hundreds of small limitedservice providers to a few full service drug development services organizations with global operations our clinical services business competitors include a number of publicly traded and privately owned companies in addition both our preclinical and clinical businesses compete with inhouse departments of pharmaceutical companies and universities and teaching hospitals 

regulatory matters 

as our business operates in a number of distinct operating segments and in a variety of locations worldwide we are subject to numerous and sometimes overlapping regulatory environments as described below 

the animal welfare act awa governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research the united states congress has passed legislation which permanently excludes rats mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa for regulated species the awa and attendant animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment methods to assure the welfare of these animals we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for the care and use of regulated species our animal production facilities in the us are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a private nonprofit international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs portions of our preclinical business are also generally regulated by the usda 

our import and export of animals in support of several of our business units as well as our operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of national regional and local laws and regulations which establish the standards for the humane treatment care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities we maintain the necessary certificates licenses detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our locations 

our preclinical services business conducts nonclinical laboratory safety studies intended to support the registration or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world the conduct of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for good laboratory practice glp glp regulations describe a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under 

which nonclinical laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded archived and reported glp compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the fda united states environmental protection agency european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products department of health doh in the united kingdom health canada and the japanese ministry of health and welfare glp requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all appropriate requirements to assure our compliance obligations we have established quality assurance units qau in each of our nonclinical laboratories the qaus operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies and monitor each study to assure management that the facilities equipment personnel methods practices records and controls are in compliance with glp our laboratory managers use the results of qau monitoring as part of a continuous process improvement program to assure our nonclinical studies meet client and regulatory expectations for quality and integrity 

our clinical services business conducts human clinical trials and provides services in support of our clients’ registration or licensing applications human clinical trials are conducted in a progressive fashion beginning with phase i to iv trials phase i studies are the initial human clinical trials and are conducted with a small number of subjects under highly controlled conditions phase ii and iii trials are conducted with an increasing number of subjects and under actual clinical conditions eg patients with the condition to be treated phase iv clinical trials are conducted after product approval with a large number of subjects under actual clinical conditions these clinical trials and services are performed in accordance with the international conference on harmonization good clinical practice guidelines and in compliance with regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human clinical trial subjects in the united states these trials and services must comply with fda regulations and in europe our clinical trials and services must comply with the clinical trials directive of the european union neither fda regulations nor the clinical trials directive requires a quality assurance program however our phase i facility has an established quality assurance unit that monitors the conduct and reporting of phase i trials to assure management that these trials are conducted in compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements we also provide quality assurance oversight of our contracted clinical service activities and offer quality assurance inspections and audits as a contract service in phase ii through iv clinical trials 

our manufacturing business produces endotoxin test kits and reagents and vaccine support products additionally the analytical divisions of several of our nonclinical laboratories conduct stability and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs these activities are subject to regulation by the fda and doh under their respective good manufacturing practice regulations or the fda’s quality systems regulation manufacturing of medical devices we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with these regulations these regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain records of the manufacturing testing and control activities 

all of our sites are also subject to licensing and regulation under national regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens the handling storage and disposal of laboratory specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials and the safety and health of laboratory employees although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such national regional and local laws failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

to ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality we have established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all quality assurance functions within the company this organization reports to our corporate vice president for regulatory affairs and compliance 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission and the federal government as implemented by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 seven of the eight members of our board of directors are independent and have no significant financial business or personal ties to the company or management and all of our board committees are composed of independent directors the board adheres to corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we have always been diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have established a process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify management and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud our internal disclosure committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines which help to ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely copies of our corporate governance guidelines and code of business conduct and ethics are available on our website at wwwcrivercom under the “investors relations—corporate governance” caption 




 item 1a   risk factors

risks related to our business and industry 

set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

over the past several years some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities we believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services by doing so they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery while obtaining the outsourced services from a fullservice provider like charles river while industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a decrease in preclinical andor clinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by the abovementioned risks 

a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers 

of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies although the level of government research funding has increased during the past several years the size of budgetary increases has recently declined government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries including potential health care reform could decrease the need for the services we provide 

governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly in the united states strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services 

in recent years the united states congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs we are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future if any similar reform movements have occurred in europe and asia 

implementation of health care reform legislation that contains costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad in addition new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability increase our costs or limit our service offerings 

our standard customer agreements contain liberal termination and service reduction provisions which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including the products being tested fails to satisfy safety requirements unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested the customer’s decision to forego or terminate a particular study or the loss of funding for the particular research study if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple 

contracts could materially adversely affect the preclinical or clinical segments’ business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventious infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including transgenic services harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up renovating disinfecting and restarting production in the contaminated barrier room or poultry house this cleanup results in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments in addition contaminations expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements these contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries represented 485 of our total net sales in 2005 363 of our total net sales in 2004 and 308 in 2003 we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks associated with our international business including 

·   foreign currencies we receive for sales outside the united states could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue that we recognize

·   general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate

·   potential international conflicts including terrorist acts

·   potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures

·   potential trade restrictions and exchange controls

·   difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks of violations of local laws or the us foreign corrupt practices act by employees oversees

·   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

·   the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations

·   unfavorable labor regulations including specifically those applicable to our european operations

·   longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and

·   import and export licensing requirements

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

the products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process and are almost universally mandated by law notwithstanding certain special interests groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject of animal rights media attention however research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention impacting our industry this has included occasional but infrequent onsite demonstrations at facilities operated by us any negative attention or threats directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently in addition if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals as has been advocated by certain groups our business could be materially adversely effected 

several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a limited international source of supply of large animal models required in our product and service offerings disruptions to their continued supply may arise from colony fertility and health problems export or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions disruptions to the air travel system or contract disputes or disruptions any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms 

we may be unable to build out our facilities as anticipated 

to take advantage of our customers’ continued growing demand for drug discovery and development services including increased strategic focus on outsourcing services and programs we are engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program with approximately 175200 million allocated for capital expenditures for 2006 included in this buildout are two us preclinical services facilities—one in massachusetts scheduled to be online by the end of 2006 and one in nevada scheduled for 2007—and an expansion of our rms california capabilities scheduled to partially open in the fourth quarter of 2006 we cannot assure you that any or all of these facilities will be constructed on the anticipated timetable or on budget any material delay in bringing these facilities online or substantial increase in costs to complete these facilities could materially and adversely affect us 

any failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results 

any failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results for example if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from patient participants in connection with a particular phase i clinical trial the data collected from that trial could be disqualified and we might be required to redo the trial at no further cost to our customer but at substantial cost to us furthermore the issuance of a notice from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive 

the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies but also with internal discovery and development departments within our clients who are often large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals if 

we do not compete successfully our business will suffer increased competition might lead to price and other forms of competition that might adversely affect our operating results as a result of competitive pressures the drug discovery and development services industry has been consolidating this trend is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies for both clients and acquisition candidates in addition for some of our business segments there are few barriers to entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against larger companies such as us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

tax benefits we expect to be available in the future may be subject to challenge 

in connection with our 1999 recapitalization our then current shareholders crl acquisition llc crl acquisition and bausch  lomb incorporated bl made a joint election intended to permit us to increase the depreciable and amortizable tax basis in our assets for federal income tax purposes thereby providing us with expected future tax benefits in connection with our initial public offering in 2000 crl acquisition reorganized terminated its existence as a corporation for tax purposes and distributed a substantial portion of its stock to its members we believe that the reorganization and liquidating distribution should not have any impact on the election for federal income tax purposes however it is possible that the internal revenue service irs may contend that this reorganization and liquidating distribution should be integrated with our original recapitalization if the irs were to be successful with this contention the expected future tax benefits at the time of the recapitalization would not be available and we would be required to write off the related deferred tax asset 

we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in the united kingdom or canada 

we have substantial operations in the united kingdom and canada which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments and it benefits from tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the united kingdom any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or allowances would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits and cash flow from either or both of our canadian and united kingdom operations and on our effective tax rate 

impairment of goodwill arising from the acquisition of inveresk may adversely impact future results of operations 

we accounted for our acquisition of inveresk as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states under the purchase method of accounting the assets and liabilities of inveresk including identifiable intangible assets have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the date the acquisition was completed the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill as a result of the combination we have recorded 13 billion of additional goodwill and 02 billion of other intangible assets which are material to us the goodwill will not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment by us at least annually if the future growth and operating results of the acquired businesses are not as strong as anticipated goodwill may be impaired to the extent goodwill is impaired its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from operations outside of the united states primarily from our operations in canada and the united kingdom where significant amounts of revenues and expenses are recorded in local nonus currency our financial statements are presented in us dollars accordingly changes in currency exchange rates particularly between the pound sterling the canadian 

dollar the european euro and the us dollar will cause fluctuations in our reported financial results which could be material in addition our contracts with foreign customers are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts this is particularly the case with respect to the canadian operations we acquired from inveresk where contracts generally provide for invoicing clients in us dollars but its expenses are generally incurred in canadian dollars where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

contract research services create a risk of liability 

in contracting to work on drug development trials as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities for example 

·   errors or omissions that create harm during a trial to study volunteers or after a trial to consumers of the drug after regulatory approval of the drug

·   general risks associated with phase i facilities including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers

·   errors or omissions from tests conducted for the agrochemical and food industries

·   risks that animals in our breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals and

·   errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial

we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regiment of animal testing quarantine and veterinary staff vigilance through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections nonetheless it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks 

we also contract with physicians also referred to as investigators to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to volunteers resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators particularly to volunteers with lifethreatening illnesses we believe that our risks in this area are generally reduced by the contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability insurance maintained by our clients investigators and by us and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 

contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions such as negligence or misconduct we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and volunteers for our clinical trials our business might suffer 

the clinical research studies we run rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of physician investigators and volunteer subjects investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise administration of the study drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial volunteer subjects generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted 

including our phase i clinic in edinburgh scotland which to date has provided a substantial pool of potential subjects for research studies our clinical research development business could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or volunteers on a consistent basis 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research companies have developed several techniques that have scientific merit it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets however we may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

during the past five years we have expanded our business through several acquisitions we plan to continue acquire businesses and technologies and form alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners but not completing the transaction even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

·   difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating operations services products or technologies

·   difficulties in developing and operating new businesses including diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns

·   potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller

·   risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies

·   the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies and

·   difficulties in achieving business and financial success

in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000 has held various positions with us for 29 years we have no employment agreement with mr foster or other members of our management if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements the commencement postponement completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter changes in the mix of our products and services the extent of cost overruns holiday patterns of our customers budget cycles of our customers and exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process these solutions include research models and outsourced preclinical and clinical services and are designed to enable our clients to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently our products and services are organized into three categories spanning every step of the drug development pipeline research models and services preclinical services and clinical services we have been in business for more than 58 years and our customer base includes all of the major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions 

our significant sales growth during 2005 was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk at the end of 2004 as well as organic growth in all segments our overall results of operations were further enhanced by the completion of the integration of inveresk unifying our products and services under our strong brand name the harmonizing of best practices derived from the combination and our achievement of our cost savings goal the businesses that we acquired in the inveresk acquisition primarily our preclinical services and clinical services segments—traditionally experience margins less robust than in our historical rms segment and the overall impact on our total margins were clearly reflected for the first time in fiscal 2005 future drivers for our products and services as a whole are primarily expected to emerge from our customers’ continued growing demand for drug discovery and development services including increased strategic focus on outsourcing should drive future sales for our products and services to take advantage of these long term opportunities we are engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program with approximately 175–200 million allocated for these capital expenditures in addition to internallygenerated organic growth our business strategy includes strategic “bolton” acquisitions that complement our business and increase the rate of our growth

our total net sales in 2005 were 112 billion an increase of 463 over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of inveresk as well as organic growth in all segments pro forma sales growth was 102 which included a 02 negative impact of foreign currency translation our gross margin decreased to 382 of net sales compared to 389 of net sales for the prior years’ period due to the greater proportion of preclinical and clinical services in the sales mix as well as a decline in the research models and services gross margin rate operating income for the year was 1810 million compared to 1603 million for 2004 the operating margin for 2005 was 161 compared to 209 for the prior year our 2005 operating margin rate was unfavorably impacted by 727 million 65 due to amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of inveresk of 539 million stockbased compensation expense related to the acquisition of inveresk of 78 million the impairment of the wisconsin preclinical services business of 65 million a charge for the acceleration of certain stock options of 16 million clinical services lease impairment of 16 million and 13 million in fees related to the repatriation of cash pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca 

net income was 1420 million in 2005 compared to 898 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share for 2005 were 196 compared to 168 in 2004 our increased earnings in 2005 were due to the acquisition of inveresk as well as organic growth in all segments in addition 2005 results were impacted favorably by the reversal of a deferred tax liability 283 million and unfavorably impacted by the operating income items of 727 million discussed above as well as the deferred financing writeoff of 21 million related to the ajca cash repatriation 

our rms segment representing 448 of net sales in 2005 includes sales of research models transgenic services laboratory services preconditioning and surgical services consulting and staffing services vaccine support and in vitro technology primarily exdotoxin testing net sales for this segment increased 56 over the same period in 2004 due to growth in research model laboratory services and in vitro sales partially offset by lower transgenic sales in 2005 the rms business continued to benefit from 

the market for a number of our product lines and particularly in specialty models and in vitro sales although we were negatively impacted by the continuing slowdown in the transgenics services market in the us overall rms operating margin remained essentially flat at 318 of net sales in 2005 compared to 320 of net sales for the prior year during 2006 we will add new capacity in california to meet our customers’ increased need for models preconditioning services and valueadded model characterization services for their drug discovery and development efforts preconditioning services presents an excellent opportunity for future growth as over the next two years we intend to open at least one new room at each of our breeding facilities to take advantage of our core competency of laboratory animal medicine which should permit our customers to take advantage of outsourcing efficiencies these capabilities will provide 

our preclinical services segment representing 435 of net sales in 2005 includes products and services required to take a drug or medical device through the development process including discovery support services toxicology services interventional pathology services biopharmaceutical services and bioanalysis pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services sales for this segment increased 836 over the same period last year which included pro forma sales growth of 172 due mainly to the inveresk acquisition and the continued favorable market conditions this year as demand remained strong especially for toxicology our primary focus during 2005 was in integrating inveresk’s preclinical services business with ours while maintaining operating growth fortunately our preclinical services business continued to experience favorable market conditions this year as demand remained strong especially for toxicology services although sales growth was negatively impacted by softness in our interventional and surgical services and biopharmaceutical services businesses in addition operating margins in preclinical services benefited from increased operating efficiencies although there was a noted decrease in operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2005 primarily attributable to an extra week in the quarter we expect to see improving levels of customer demand in certain of our development services businesses particularly large animal reproductive toxicology and inhalation we continue to focus on meeting the growing demand for our preclinical services and increased outsourcing trends through our expansion program during 2005 we opened new capacity in montreal canada and purchased an additional facility in massachusetts which we expect will be outfitted and online in late 2006 and in the first quarter of 2007 in addition in 2006 we plan to bring on new capacity in edinburgh scotland as well as purchase a new west coast preclinical facility which we expect will be online in 2007 

our clinical services segment which represented 116 of net sales in 2005 was created as a result of the acquisition of inveresk’s clinical service business this business segment conducts phase i clinical trials and provides phase iiiv clinical trials management services which include testing medical data sciences services and regulatory support our clinical services business benefits from our focus on key therapeutic areas including oncology ophthalmology cardiovascular respiratory and infectious diseases we believe that our clinical services segment can succeed best though this targeted focus—offering technical depth in a limited number of specialties—and an emphasis on margin improvement in 2005 we observed a lengthening of time to convert verbal awards to signed contracts which negatively impacted sales growth throughout the industry but particularly in the us in 2005 we enhanced our medical data services capabilities through technological investments which are intended to enhance our service offerings overall in 2006 we are focusing on clinical services margin expansion and should benefit towards this goal from our fourth quarter 2005 personnel and facilities reductions 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and intangibles and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 

 

  

  

 

  

in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to use judgment when making assumptions that are involved in preparing estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management believes the following critical accounting policies are most affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affected our more significant judgments and estimates than usual in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement 

·   goodwill and other intangible assets

·   revenue recognition

·   pension plan accounting

·   income taxes and deferred tax assets

goodwill other intangible assets   we have intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinitelived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to the acquisition of inveresk as well other businesses we acquired the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition require significant management judgments and estimates these estimates are made based on among others input from an accredited independent valuation consultant reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations

we perform an annual review of goodwill to determine if an impairment exists goodwill is considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units our evaluation includes management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review key assumptions strategies opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment our market capitalization was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis we performed annual impairment tests in 2005 and concluded the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset balances were not impaired as of december 31 2005 we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of 16 billion in the consolidated balance sheet the results of this year’s impairment review is as of a point in time and changes in future business strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these assets in subsequent years 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue on product and services sales we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreedupon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts revenue of agreedupon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based on rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in accordance with procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period in some cases a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed conversely in some cases revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the customer this revenue is recorded as unbilled sales as of december 31 2005 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 566 million and deferred revenue of 1163 million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts

pension plan accounting   as of december 31 2005 we had a pension liability of 528 million the actuarial computations require the use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the key assumptions include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases in addition our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 31 2005 the weighted average discount rate for our pension plans was 528

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants this includes considering the assets 

allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years during 2005 based on our most recent analysis of historical and projected returns we lowered our expected return on plan assets resulting in a weighted average return of 728 from 763 this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately 05 million in 2006 the estimated effect of a 10 change in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by 14 million 

income taxes and deferred tax assets   as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet in certain cases we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations

as of december 31 2005 we had a valuation allowance of approximately 64 million the valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where management does not believe it is more likely than not a benefit will be realized approximately 57 million of the valuation allowance was established against deferred tax assets acquired as part of the inveresk acquisition and any future recognition of the asset will result in an adjustment to goodwill we have recognized the balance of the deferred tax asset on the belief that it is more likely than not it will be realized this belief is based on all available evidence including historical operating results projections of taxable income and tax planning strategies 

as of december 31 2005 earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1479 million no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this undistributed foreign income 

we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in rates or in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes that we anticipate to change these changes could result in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities around the world due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our business operations we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis as a result we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

net sales   net sales in 2005 were 1122 million an increase of 3553 million or 463 from 7669 million in 2004

research models and services   in 2005 net sales from our rms segment were 5032 million an increase of 265 million or 56 from 4767 million in 2004 favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 02 to our net sales gain rms global prices increased approximately 3 and unit volume of both models and services increased approximately 2 sales of our research models and services increased particularly in north america due to growing market demand for our higher priced specialty units partially offset by a continued slowdown in the transgenic service market the rms sales increase was driven by increases in basic research and biotechnology spending which drove greater demand for our products and services

preclinical services   in 2005 net sales from our preclinical services segment were 4885 million an increase of 2225 million or 836 compared to 2660 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk in october 2004 and the increased customer demand for toxicology and other preclinical services partially offset by the negative impact of softness in our interventional and surgical services and biopharmaceutical services businesses our preclinical services business benefited from the growth of the preclinical market reflecting increased drug development efforts and outsourcing trends foreign currency unfavorably impacted the sales growth rate by less than 04

clinical services   in 2005 net sales from our clinical services segment were 1305 million sales from our clinical services segment in 2004 were 243 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 we entered the clinical services business with the acquisition of inveresk our clinical services business benefited from our focus on key areas of therapeutic clinical trials and higher sales in our european phase ii–iv business

cost of products sold and services provided   cost of products sold and services provided in 2005 was 6935 million an increase of 2252 million or 481 from 4684 million in 2004 cost of products sold and services provided in 2005 was 618 of net sales compared to 611 in 2004 due to the greater proportion of preclinical and clinical services in our sales mix and increased costs in the rms segment partially offset by greater capacity utilization in the preclinical and clinical segments

research models and services   cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2005 was 2875 million an increase of 176 million or 65 compared to 2699 million in 2004 cost of products sold and services provided in 2005 increased to 571 of net sales compared to 566 of net sales in 2004 the increase in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the slow down in the transgenic services sales and higher fuel costs

preclinical services   cost of products sold and services provided for the preclinical services segment in 2005 was 3189 million an increase of 1392 million or 775 compared to 1797 million in 2004 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was 653 in 2005 compared to 676 in 2004 the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improved capacity utilization from the increased sales of services along with select pricing increases

clinical services   in the fourth quarter of 2004 we entered the clinical services business with the acquisition of inveresk cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was 667 in 2005 compared to 772 in 2004 due to our focus on key areas of therapeutic clinical trials

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses in 2005 were 1895 million an increase of 681 million or 561 from 1214 million in 2004 selling general and administrative expenses in 2005 were 169 of net sales compared to 158 of net sales in 2004 the increase as a percent of sales was due primarily to the impact of our restricted stock grant in 2005 stock based compensation the closure of the preclinical wisconsin facility of 65 million a charge for the acceleration of stock options of 16 million clinical lease impairment of 16 million and fees related to the repatriation of 13 million

research models and services   selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2005 were 556 million an increase of 15 million or 28 compared to 541 million in 2004 selling general and administrative expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales to 110 in 2005 from 113 in 2004

preclinical services   selling general and administrative expenses for the preclinical services segment in 2005 were 653 million an increase of 268 million or 696 compared to 385 million in 2004 selling general and administrative expenses in 2005 decreased to 134 of net sales compared to 145 of net sales in 2004 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 was due primarily to the increased sales offsetting the effect of increased expenses which include the impairment charge related to the wisconsin facility of 65 million

clinical services   selling general and administrative expenses in 2005 were 253 million or 194 of net sales in compared to 95 in 2004 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the full year effect of clinical services and the lease impairment of 16 million

unallocated corporate overhead   unallocated corporate overhead which consists of various corporate expenses including those associated with pension executive salaries and departments such as corporate accounting legal and investor relations was 433 million in 2005 compared to 266 million in 2004 the substantial increase in unallocated corporate overhead in 2005 was due to our restricted stock compensation inveresk related stock based compensation and professional fees associated with the repatriation

amortization of other intangibles   amortization of other intangibles in 2005 was 582 million an increase of 414 million from 168 million in 2004 the increased amortization was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk

research models and services   in 2005 amortization of other intangibles for our rms segment was 03 million an increase of 01 million from 02 million in 2004

preclinical services   in 2005 amortization of other intangibles for our preclinical services segment was 458 million an increase of 317 million from 141 million in 2004 the increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to the fullyear effect of the inveresk acquisition

clinical services   in 2005 amortization of other intangibles for our clinical services segment was 121 million due to the acquisition of inveresk

operating income   operating income in 2005 was 1810 million an increase of 207 million or 129 from 1603 million in 2004 operating income in 2005 was 161 of net sales compared to 209 of net sales in 2004 the decrease as a percent of sales was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of amortization of intangibles and the stockbased compensation in both cases relating to our acquisition of inveresk as well as the increased mix of preclinical and clinical services in our overall business

research models and services   in 2005 operating income for our rms segment was 1598 million an increase of 72 million or 47 from 1526 million in 2004 operating income as a percentage of net sales in 2005 was 318 compared to 320 in 2004 the decrease in operating income as a percent to sales was primarily due to increase in cost of products sold and services provided due to the slowdown in the transgenic services

liquidity and capital resources 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating investing and financing activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 

our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flow from operations and our revolving line of credit arrangements 

on december 20 2005 we amended and restated our thenexisting 550 million credit agreement to modify certain restrictive covenants as well as provide for a 65 million term loan facility and a 10 million revolving facility for a canadian subsidiary and a 25 million term loan facility and a 10 million revolving facility for two uk subsidiaries the 660 million credit agreement our now 660 million credit agreement originally provided for a 400 million term loan facility and a 150 million revolving facility the 400 million term loan facility matures in 20 equal quarterly installments with the last installment due september 30 2009 the 150 million revolving facility matures on october 15 2009 and requires no scheduled payment before that date the new canadian and uk term loans aggregate 90 million under the 660 million credit agreement are repayable in full by september 30 2009 and require no scheduled prepayment before that date the new revolving facilities aggregate 20 million mature on october 15 2009 and require no scheduled prepayment before that date the interest rate applicable to the canadian and uk term loans and the canadian and uk revolving loans under the credit agreement is the adjusted libor rate in its relevant currency plus an interest rate margin based upon the our leverage ratio the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement are at our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio based on our leverage ratio the margin range for libor based loans is 075 to 125 the interest rate margin was 0875 as of december 31 2005 the 660 million credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties negative and affirmative covenants and events of default we had 50 million outstanding under letters of credit as of december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 respectively 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 we prepaid 120 million of our debt under the 400 million term loan facility which resulted in a 22 million writeoff of deferred financing costs 

the company is also party to a 50 million credit agreement which was entered into on july 27 2005 and which was subsequently amended on december 20 2005 the 50 million credit agreement provides for a 50 million term loan facility which matures on july 27 2007 and can be extended for an additional 7 years the interest rates applicable to term loans under this credit agreement are at the our option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 or the libor rate plus 075 the 50 million credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties negative and affirmative covenants and events of default effective december 20 2005 we amended this credit agreement to reflect substantially the same modifications made to the covenants in the 660 million credit agreement 

during the second quarter of 2005 we converted all of the 185 million 35 senior convertible debentures due february 1 2022 into 4759424 shares of common stock we recorded additional equity of 1980 million due to the conversion which represented the book value of the debentures 1850 million deferred tax liability associated with the debentures 145 million and accrued interest 14 million partially offset by the writeoff of the deferred financing costs 28 million we issued 1750 million par value of these senior convertible debentures through a private placement offering on january 24 2002 subsequently we issued an additional 10000 par value of senior convertible debentures through the 

additional purchase option on february 11 2002 we used a portion of the net proceeds from the senior convertible debenture offering to retire all of its 135 senior subordinated notes 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 1148 million at december 31 2005 compared to 2076 million at december 25 2004 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 and 2004 was 2374 million and 1848 million respectively the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk as well as improvements in other businesses which increased net income our days sales outstanding increased to 33 days as of december 31 2005 from 32 days as of december 25 2004 during 2005 our pension was a 94 million use of funds due to increased funding 

net cash used in investing activities in 2005 and 2004 was 1151 million and 6000 million respectively our capital expenditures in 2005 were 955 million of which 246 million was related to rms 703 million related to preclinical services and 07 million to clinical services for 2006 we project capital expenditures to be approximately 175  200 million we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by operating activities and existing credit facilities 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 was 1938 million and cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was 4369 million during 2005 we repaid 3375 million of our debt partially offset by additional borrowing of 1359 million 

minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december 31 2005 are as follows 

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements during any of fiscal 2005 2004 or 2003 

recent accounting pronouncements 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharedbased payment” which is a revision of sfas no 123 sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values this revised standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter in 2006 

as permitted by sfas no 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25 intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method will have an impact on our financial statements although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of the modified prospective adoption of sfas no 123r cannot be estimated at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points from levels at december 31 2005 then the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately 02 million 

we have entered into two credit agreements the 660 million credit agreement and the 50 million credit agreement our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans in the 660 million credit agreement and in the 50 million agreement and our revolving credit facilities our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would be approximately 5 million on a pretax basis the book value of our debt approximates fair value 

during the second quarter of 2005 we converted all of its 185 million 35 senior convertible debentures due february 1 2022 into 4759424 shares of common stock 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies a portion of our foreign operations’ revenue is denominated in us dollars with the costs accounted for in their local currencies we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy in accordance with our hedge policy we designate such transactions as hedges as set forth in sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” 

during 2005 we utilized foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items no material foreign exchange contracts were outstanding on december 31 2005

overview 

we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug and medical device discovery and development we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for more than 55 years since 1992 we have built upon our research model technologies to develop a diverse and growing portfolio of products and services our wide array of tools and services enables our customers to reduce costs increase speed and enhance their productivity and effectiveness in drug and medical device discovery and development our customer base includes major pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies as well as many government agencies leading hospitals and academic institutions throughout the world we currently operate numerous facilities in 16 countries worldwide our products and services supported by our 

global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise enable our customers to meet many of the challenges of earlystage life sciences research a large and growing market in 2003 our net sales were 6137 million and our operating income was 1386 million 

during the later part of 2003 we expanded our in vitro market opportunity with our new portable version of our highly successful endotoxin testing platform called endosafe®pts which allows endotoxin testing in the field affording researchers accurate and timely results in january 2004 we further expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of river valley farms rvf a medical device contract research business located near minneapolis minnesota we have combined rvf with our existing contract surgical research services group which has been providing preclinical medical device testing services for the past three years to form a new unit called interventional and surgical services iss we expect the acquisition of rvf to significantly improve our ability to meet our customers needs in this area 

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we changed our business segments to better strategically align related business units and to focus sales force and management responsibilities as a result some of our operating units are now presented within a business segment that is different from that previously reported in our sec reports we are continuing to report two business segments now called research models and services rms and development and safety testing dst we believe that the new business segments will better reflect our results of operations and facilitate understanding of the companys business the changes in segment presentation have no effect on our consolidated revenues or net income prior year segment information included in this form 10k has been restated to reflect this change 

research models and services rms 

we are the global leader in the production and sale of research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice and have been supplying research models since 1947 we also provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates rms accounted for 66 of total net sales in 2003 

research models a significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of animal research models principally purposebred rats mice and other rodents for use by researchers our research models include genetically defined models and models with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as earlystage research tools the food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates and many medical devices to be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process our research models are bred and maintained in a biosecure environment designed to ensure that the animals are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our biosecure production capabilities we are able to consistently deliver high quality research models worldwide we also provide larger animal models including rabbits and primates to the research community principally for use in their drug development and testing studies 

our research models include 

• outbred animals which are genetically heterogeneous • inbred animals which are genetically identical • other geneticallymodified research models • knockout models with one or more disabled genes • hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents 2 

• spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturallyoccurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and • transgenic animals which contain genetic material transferred from a different species we offer one of the largest selections of small animal models and provide our customers with highvolume and highquality production our rats mice and other rodent species such as guinea pigs and hamsters have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality in the breeding process we provide our small animal models to numerous customers around the world including most pharmaceutical companies major biotechnology companies many government agencies leading hospital and academic institutions in 2001 we acquired new and proprietary diseasespecific rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease and kidney disease 

we believe that over the next several years many new research models will be developed and used in biomedical research such as transgenic models with modified genetic material knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models that incorporate or exclude a particular mouse rat or human gene these more highlydefined and characterized models will allow researchers to further focus their investigations into disease conditions and potential new therapies or interventions we intend to build upon our position as the leader in this field to expand our presence in this market for highervalue research models 

we have a strategic partnership with the jackson laboratory an internationally renowned research institution that in addition to research functions develops unique mouse models for use in medical research drug discovery and development work through this partnership we produce and distribute the jackson laboratorys research models in europe and asia the partnership combines the jackson laboratorys strength in genetic science with our global production and distribution capabilities we view this relationship as an important step toward broadening the scope of our research models business 

rms also offers services such as health monitoring medical and genetic profiling surgery genetic transplantation and specialty services dictated by our customers our services are designed to assist our customers in screening drug candidates faster by providing a variety of services related to geneticallydefined research models for inhouse research and by implementing efficacy screening protocols to improve the customers drug evaluation process these services initiated in 1995 address the growing need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business we currently offer four major categories of research models services transgenic services laboratory services contract staffing and vaccine support 

transgenic services in this area of our business we assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing research models purchased or created by them for biomedical research activities while the creation of a transgenic model can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of research models requires significant additional technical expertise we provide transgenic breeding expertise model characterization and colony development genetic characterization phenotyping quarantine embryo cryopreservation embryo transfer and health and genetic monitoring we provide these services to nearly 200 laboratories around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities we maintain more than 1000 different types of naturally occurring or experimentally manipulated research models for our customers we expect that the demand for our services will grow as the use of genetically modified research models continues to grow within the research community in order to meet the growing demand for these services we are adding capacity in europe and japan in 2004 and we expect to begin construction of another substantial facility at our massachusetts headquarters in early 2005 

laboratory services we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its solesource testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in development and utilization of specific disease models and genetically engineered models such as transgenic models will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for genetic testing of special models 

contract staffing building upon our core capability as a leading provider of highquality research models we manage animal care operations on behalf of government and academic organizations as well as commercial customers in the biotechnology and related sectors demand for our services reflects the growing necessity of these large institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to the core scientific innovation process in addition we believe that our expertise in managing the laboratory animal environment enhances the productivity and quality of our customers research facilities this area leads to additional opportunities for us to provide other products and services to our customers site management does not typically require us to make any incremental investment thereby generating a favorable return on deployed assets 

vaccine support we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the manufacturing of live and dead viruses these viruses are used as a raw material in poultry and human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar in many ways to our research model production we have a worldwide presence that includes several spf egg production facilities in the united states as well as facilities in germany and australia and a joint venture in mexico we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse testing and support services to our customers 

development and safety testing dst 

discovery represents the earliest stages of research and development in the life sciences directed to the identification and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery is followed by development activities which are directed at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the selected drug candidates discovery and development represent most of the preclinical activities in drug development the development services portion of our dst business segment enables our customers to outsource their noncore drug development activities to us these activities are typically required for support of the regulatory filings necessary to obtain fda approval the demand for these services is driven by the trend to outsource certain preclinical drug discovery and development activities 

we have focused significant resources on building a diverse portfolio of development and safety testing products and services our dst business represented 34 of our total net sales in 2003 we currently offer dst services in seven main areas general and specialty toxicology pathology services interventional surgical services biosafety testing pharmacokinetic and metabolic analysis bioanalytical chemistry and in vitro technology 

general and specialty toxicology our team of scientists including toxicologists pathologists and regulatory specialists designs and performs general and highlyspecialized studies to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new pharmaceutical compounds and materials used in medical devices we are an industry leader in the fields of reproductive and developmental toxicology photobiology and other specialty toxicological assessments 

pathology services in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize pathologic changes within tissues and cells is critical in determining the safety of a new compound we employ highlytrained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to identify pathology within tissues and cells as well as at the molecular level frequently decisions regarding continued product development are dependent on these pathology findings 

interventional and surgical services iss many sophisticated drugs are designed to be administered directly to a precise location within the body using surgical or invasive techniques the development of these and certain other drugs requires the use of surgical techniques to administer a drug or to observe its effects in various tissues our iss group offers extensive capabilities in this area and has collaborated with worldrenowned experts in the fields of cardiology inflammation and pathology at leading academic institutions our iss unit also provides a wide variety of medical device testing services from prototype feasibility testing to longterm glp or good laboratory practices studies primarily in large research models the fda requires companies introducing medical devices to test the biocompatibility of any new materials that have not previously been approved for contact with human tissue our services include cardiovascular surgery biomaterial reactivity studies orthopedic studies and related laboratory services we maintain stateoftheart surgical suites where our skilled professional staff implement custom surgery protocols provided by our customers in january 2004 we acquired rvf a medical device contract research business located near minneapolis minnesota we expect the acquisition of rvf to significantly improve our business in this area 

biosafety testing we provide specialized nonclinical quality control testing that is frequently outsourced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies these services allow our customers to determine if the human protein drug candidates or the process for manufacturing those products are essentially free of residual biological materials the bulk of this testing work is required by the fda for obtaining new drug approval maintaining an fdalicensed manufacturing facility or releasing approved products for use in patients our scientific staff consults with customers in the areas of process development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing 

pharmacokinetic and metabolic analysis our scientists conduct metabolic studies to reveal how drugs are broken down and excreted and the duration that drugs or their byproducts remain in various organs tissues and the circulatory systems in multiple species in addition we have extensive capabilities and resources which can be directed towards assessing both in vivo and in vitro the pharmacokinetic compounds in lead optimization studies these studies can be performed as part of the drug screening process to help discover and nominate lead compounds as well as later in the development process to provide information regarding safety and efficacy 

bioanalytical chemistry our bioanalytical chemistry services support all phases of drug discovery and development from lead optimization through nonclinical studies and clinical trials for lead optimization support our researchers apply proven high throughput methodologies to rapidly screen compounds to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties in supporting nonclinical and clinical development studies our researchers develop and validate assays in full regulatory compliance to support these efforts we also provide through a joint venture leadingedge proteomics testing and analysis services on a feeforservice contract basis to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 

in vitro technology our dst business also provides nonanimal or in vitro methods for testing the safety of drugs and medical devices we are strategically committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible our in vitro technology business produces and distributes test kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for medical devices and other products worldwide we are a market leader in endotoxin testing which is used for quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices their components and the processes under which they are manufactured for the presence of endotoxins 

quality control testing for endotoxin contamination by our customers is an fda requirement for injectable drugs and medical devices endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate lal the lal test is the first and only major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test for endotoxin detection in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing the process of extracting blood is generally not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment in 2003 we expanded our in vitro market opportunity with a new portable version of our highly successful endotoxin testing platform the endosafe portable testing system endosafe®pts allows endotoxin testing in the field affording researchers accurate and timely results we continue to explore opportunities in nontraditional markets for water and surface monitoring such as food and beverage hospitals and pharmaceuticals 

competitive strengths 

our products and services are critical to both traditional pharmaceutical research and the growing fields of genomics proteomics recombinant protein and humanized antibody research we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in all of these markets as a result of a diverse set of competitive strengths which include 

critical products and services we provide critical proven and enabling products and services that our customers rely on to advance their earlystage research efforts and accelerate product development we offer a wide array of complementary research tools and discovery and development services that differentiate us from our competition and have created a sustained competitive advantage in many of our markets 

longstanding reputation for scientific excellence we have earned our longstanding reputation for scientific excellence by consistently delivering highquality research models supported by exceptional technical service and support for over 55 years as a result the charles river brand name is synonymous with premium quality products and services and scientific excellence in the biomedical research industry we have nearly 250 science professionals on staff with dvms phds and mds in areas including laboratory animal medicine molecular biology pathology immunology toxicology and pharmacology 

extensive global infrastructure and customer relationships our operations are globally integrated throughout north america europe and asia our extensive investment in worldwide infrastructure allows us to standardize our products and services across borders when required by our multinational customers while also offering a customized local presence when needed we currently operate numerous facilities in 16 countries worldwide serving a global customer base 

biosecurity technology expertise in our research models business our commitment to and expert knowledge of biosecurity technology distinguishes us from our competition we maintain rigorous biosecurity standards in all of our facilities to maintain the health profile and consistency of our research models these qualities are crucial to the integrity and timeliness of our customers research 

platform acquisition capabilities we have a proven track record of successfully identifying acquiring and developing complementary businesses with this experience we have developed internal expertise in sourcing acquisitions 

experienced and incentivized management team most of our senior management team has an average of nearly 20 years of service with our company our chairman and chief executive officer james c foster has been with us for 27 years as of december 27 2003 our management team owned or had options to acquire securities representing approximately 30 of our equity on a fullydiluted basis 

our strategy 

our business is driven by the continued growth of research and development spending by pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies the federal government and academic institutions as the pressure to develop new drugs increases for these industries so does the pressure to contain costs implement research in multiple countries simultaneously and identify hire and retain a breadth of experienced experts these trends create opportunities for companies such as ours that can help speed the drug discovery and development process our strategy is to meet these needs by continuing to build upon our core research models business and to actively invest in new opportunities and become a full service preclinical outsourcing provider to the drug discovery and development industry 

we intend to continue to broaden the scope of our products and services primarily through acquisitions and alliances we have improved our ability to offer new services that complement our existing drug discovery and development businesses over the past decade we have completed 22 acquisitions and alliances that have contributed to our financial results several of our operations began as platform acquisitions which we were able to grow by developing and marketing the acquired products or services to our extensive global customer base we intend to further pursue strategic platform acquisitions to drive our longterm growth we believe our approach to acquisitions is a disciplined one that seeks to focus on businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing stockholder value this strategy may include geographic expansion of an existing core service strengthening of one of our core services or the addition of a new product or service 

we also intend to continue to expand our preclinical outsourcing services many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers outsource a wide variety of research activities that are critical to their scientific innovation process we believe the trend of outsourcing preclinical or earlystage research will continue to increase we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities principally through our discovery and development services offerings we believe our early successes in the transgenic services area have increased customer demand for outsourcing and have created significant opportunities we intend to focus our marketing efforts on stimulating demand for further outsourcing of preclinical research to gain market share we also intend to expand our opportunities by continuing to increase our international presence 

customers 

our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical companies as well as biotechnology animal health medical device and diagnostic companies and hospitals academic institutions and government agencies and other life sciences companies we have many longterm stable relationships with our customers 

during 2003 in both our rms and dst businesses more than threequarters of our sales were to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the balance was to hospitals universities and government agencies no single commercial customer accounted for more than 5 of our total net sales in 2003 and our top 20 customers accounted for 32 of total net sales 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years please review note 16 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

for information regarding net sales and longlived assets attributable to operations in the united states japan france and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years please review note 16 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force the majority of whom work in the united states with the balance working in europe and japan the direct sales force is supplemented by a network of international distributors for our products businesses in late 2003 we realigned our us sales force to provide each business segment with its own dedicated sales team 

our internal marketing groups support the field sales staff while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry we believe our internet site wwwcrivercom is an effective marketing tool and has become recognized as a valuable resource in the laboratory animal field by a broad spectrum of industry leaders 

we maintain both customer service and technical assistance departments which service our customers routine and more specialized needs we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity study design regulatory consulting protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is recognized as a valuable customer resource 

research and development 

we do not maintain a fullydedicated research and development staff and therefore have not had any significant research and development costs in any of the past three fiscal years our approach to developing new products or services is to extend our base technologies into new applications and fields and in some instances to license or acquire technologies to serve as platforms for the development of new businesses that service our existing customer base our research and development focus is principally on developing projects that improve our productivity or processes 

industry support and animal welfare 

among the shared values of our employees is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to demonstrate our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical area of our business 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund internships in laboratory animal medicine provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field one of our businesses dedicates a portion of its net sales through a royalty to support similar programs and initiatives 

employees 

as of december 27 2003 we had approximately 4500 employees including nearly 250 science professionals with advanced degrees including dvms phds and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized at some of our european facilities consistent with local custom for our industry our annual satisfaction surveys indicate that we have a good relationship with our employees 

backlog 

backlog usually includes work to be performed under signed agreements once work under a signed agreement begins net sales are recognized over the life of the project we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units for a variety of reasons including almost all of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice the scope of studies frequently changes which may either increase or decrease their value and studies may be reduced in scope or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities therefore management does not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our business 

competition 

our strategy is to become a leader in each of the markets in which we participate our competitors are generally different in each of our business and geographic areas 

in our rms segment our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america several smaller ones in europe and two smaller ones in japan of our main united states competitors two are privatelyheld businesses and the third is a governmentfunded notforprofit institution we believe that none of our competitors in rms has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships 

we have many competitors in our dst segment a few of which are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or other resources than we do however many are smaller and more regionalized 

we compete in the marketplace on the basis of quality reputation and availability supported by our international presence with strategically located facilities 

regulatory matters 

the animal welfare act awa governs the treatment of particular species intended for use in research the awa imposes a wide variety of specific regulations on producers and users of these species most notably cage size shipping conditions sanitation and environmental enrichment methods we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the united states department of agriculture usda for handling regulated species including breeding research use maintenance and transportation however rats mice and chickens are not regulated under the awa congress recently adopted legislation which permanently excludes these species from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa our animal production facilities in the united states are accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac a highly regarded member association which maintains standards that often exceed those of the usda 

portions of our dst are also generally regulated by the usda and in the case of our endotoxin detection systems the fda our manufacture of test kits and reagents for endotoxin testing is subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the federal food drug and cosmetic act we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the fdas quality system regulations and good manufacturing practices these regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing testing and control activities 

corporate governance 

we are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability we complied with all of the new york stock exchange nyse corporate governance standards prior to their approval by 

the sec seven of our eight board members are independent and have no financial personal or significant business ties to the company or management and all of our board committees other than the executive committee are composed of independent directors the board adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics which has been communicated to employees and posted on our website we have always been diligent in complying with generally accepted accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent timely and accurate we have established a process through which employees either directly or anonymously can notify us and the audit committee of the board of directors of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud we have created an internal disclosure committee that meets regularly and adopted disclosure procedures and guidelines to help ensure that our public disclosures are accurate and timely 

industry and market data 

in this form 10k we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the research models and development services industries and our market share in the markets in which we compete we obtained this information and statistics from various thirdparty sources none of which should be considered definitive discussions with our customers andor our own internal estimates we believe that these sources and estimates are reliable but we have not independently verified them 

risks related to our business and industry 

set forth below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k 

our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our international revenues which include revenues from our nonus subsidiaries represented 308 of our total net sales in 2003 274 in 2002 and 273 in 2001 we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future there are a number of risks arising from our international business including 

• foreign currencies we receive for sales outside the us could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the us dollar and reduce the amount of revenue that we recognize • general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate • potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures • potential trade restrictions and exchange controls • difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements • the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations • longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries and • import and export licensing requirements our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by the above mentioned risks for example because both sales and costs at our foreign businesses are conducted in the local currency we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar in the reported results of our foreign operations these fluctuations may decrease our earnings we 

currently do not hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations because both sales and costs at our foreign businesses are maintained in local currency the economic situation in some of the foreign countries in which we operate may result in slower payments of outstanding receivable balances our financial results could be adversely affected by weakness in the economies and currencies in these regions 

a reduction in research and development budgets may adversely affect our business 

our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development at rates close to or at historical levels and to outsource the products and services we provide fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as by academic institutions government laboratories or private foundations 

a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of net sales in our rms segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies although the level of government research funding has increased substantially during the past several years we believe this increase may not continue at historic rates in the short term government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently unpredictable our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals also government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results our customers generally receive funds from approved grants at particular times of the year as determined by the us federal government in the past grants have been frozen for extended periods or have otherwise become unavailable to various institutions without advance notice the timing of the receipt of grant funds affects the timing of purchase decisions by our customers and as a result can cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and nonclinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease which could slow our growth 

some areas of our discovery and development services business have grown significantly as a result of the increase over the past several years in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and nonclinical research support activities while industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a substantial decrease in preclinical and nonclinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas 

our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice termination of a large contract for services or multiple contracts for services could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

generally our agreements with our customers provide that the customer can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including unexpected or undesired study results production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested the customers decision to forego or terminate a particular study or the loss of funding for the particular research study if a customer terminates a contract with us we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and in some cases penalties primarily in our dst segment cancellation of a large contract or simultaneous cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect that segments business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

during the past three years we have expanded our business through several acquisitions we plan to continue to grow our business through acquisitions of businesses and technologies and the formation of alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating operations services products or technologies • difficulties in developing and operating new businesses including diversion of managements attention from other business concerns • the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and difficulties in attracting new employees to grow businesses and • difficulties in achieving business and financial success in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet expectations our results of operations may be adversely affected we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business or successfully exploit new business or technologies 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of contaminants such as viruses and bacteria because the presence of contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results contaminations in our isolated breeding rooms or poultry houses could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up the contaminated room or poultry house this cleanup results in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments these contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations however contaminations may still occur 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research companies have developed several techniques that have scientific merit especially in the area of cosmetics and household product testing markets in which we do not market our products or services only a few alternative test methods in the discovery and development of effective and safe treatments for human and animal disease conditions have been validated and successfully deployed the principal validated nonanimal test system is the lal or endotoxin detection system a technology which we acquired and have aggressively marketed as an alternative to testing in animals it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets however these methods may not be available to us or we may not be successful in commercializing these methods even if we are successful sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales 

we face significant competition in our business and if we are unable to respond to competition in our business our revenues may decrease 

we face significant competition from different competitors in each of our business units some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or other resources than we do we generally compete on the basis of quality reputation and availability of service expansion by our competitors into other areas in which we operate new entrants into our markets or changes in our competitors strategies could adversely affect our competitive position any erosion of our competitive position may decrease our revenues or limit our growth 

threat of future terrorist activity or related us military action may have a negative impact on the economy and our business 

the current political and business turmoil in many parts of the world including the threat of future terrorist attacks on the us and other parts of the world and related us military action continues to put severe pressure on global economic conditions and the us economy such pressure may have a negative effect on research and development outsourcing and spending which would adversely impact our business 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not historically been the subject of animal rights media attention however we have experienced protests by animal right activists which included threats against our facilities and employees overseas future negative attention or threats against our facilities or employees could adversely affect our business 

one of our large animal operations is dependent on a single source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on an international source of supply for one of our large animal operations disruptions to their continued supply may arise from colony fertility and health problems export or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability severe weather conditions or contract disputes or disruptions any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary source on comparable commercial terms 

tax benefits we expect to be available in the future may be subject to challenge 

in connection with our 1999 recapitalization our then current shareholders crl acquisition llc crl acquisition and bausch  lomb incorporated bl made a joint election intended to permit us to increase the depreciable and amortizable tax basis in our assets for federal income tax purposes thereby providing us with expected future tax benefits in connection with our initial public offering in 2000 crl acquisition reorganized terminated its existence as a corporation for tax purposes and distributed a substantial portion of its stock to its members we believe that the reorganization and liquidating distribution should not have any impact on the election for federal income tax purposes however it is possible that the internal revenue service irs may contend that this reorganization and liquidating distribution should be integrated with our original recapitalization if the irs were to be successful with this contention the expected future tax benefits at the time of the recapitalization would not be available and we would be required to write off the related deferred tax asset 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 has held various positions with us for 27 years and is our chairman we have no employment agreement with mr foster nor with any other executive officer if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel while we have an excellent record of employee retention there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our quarterly operating results may vary which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements the commencement postponement completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter changes in the mix of our products and services the extent of cost overruns holiday patterns of our customers budget cycles of our customers and exchange rate fluctuations we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results nonetheless fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

overview 

we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in business for more than 55 years 

we believe our financial performance in 2003 demonstrated continued strength in our global business operations despite difficult market conditions we delivered solid revenue growth improved operating margins strong profitability and excellent cash flow total net sales in 2003 were 6137 million an increase of 107 over the same period last year favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 35 to our net sales gain our acquisitions of springborn and biolabs in 2002 along with the consolidation of our mexican joint venture contributed 41 to our net sales increase over last year our gross margin increased to 381 of net sales compared to 377 of net sales for 2002 operating income increased 133 to 1386 million in 2003 from 1223 million in 2002 and the operating margin increased to 226 compared to 220 for 2002 net income was 802 million in 2003 compared to 501 million in 2002 diluted earnings per share for 2003 was 164 compared to 106 in 2002 the 2003 results include a net charge of 08 million resulting from an asset impairment charge related to the closure of our biopharmaceutical production facility partially offset by a litigation settlement in our favor related to our french subsidiaries the 2002 results included a charge of 299 million for the early retirement of debt 

our products and services are marketed throughout the world our international revenues which consists of revenues from our nonus subsidiaries represented 308 of our total net sales in 2003 274 in 2002 and 273 in 2001 the increase in international revenues during 2003 was principally due to the strong euro and yen we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we revised our consolidated financial reporting segments to better reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed we believe the revision was appropriate because in 2003 a number of changes were made to align related businesses to focus sales force responsibilities and to simplify management structure we will continue to report two segments now called research models  services rms and development  safety testing dst the research models business will continue to be reported in the rms segment and transgenic services laboratory services contract staffing services and vaccine support products and services will now be reported in the rms segment the company will report development services including general and specialty toxicology pathology services interventional and surgical services biosafety testing and in vitro technology in the dst segment the changes in segment presentation have no effect on our consolidated revenues or net income management believes that the new business segments will better reflect results of operations and facilitate investors understanding of our business segment information for the prior years has been restated to reflect this change 

our rms business segment represented 660 of net sales in 2003 net sales for this segment increased 145 over the same period in 2002 favorable foreign currency translation increased pricing and higher sales of inbred models immunocompromised models and increased sales for our services that support research models contributed to the net sales gain in 2003 operating income increased to 312 of net sales in 2003 compared to 290 of net sales for the same period in 2002 primarily due to improved capacity utilization in north america and europe rms reported slower sales in the late summer of 2003 reflecting greater seasonality than we had experienced in 2002 however rms sales 

in the fourth quarter of 2003 exceeded our expectations which enabled this segment to record strong growth for the year we believe this was due to an improving biotechnology funding environment in the closing months of 2003 which allowed these companies to intensify their efforts to bring drug candidates to market we also experienced increased spending by large pharmaceutical companies on research models towards the later part of 2003 as they increased their emphasis on development spending to get drug candidates through the clinic and to market as patents began to expire on many older drugs we also saw a continuing investment in basic research by the government and academic sectors where substantial early research is done spending on research models in the notforprofit sector also increased at the end of 2003 

our dst segment represented 340 of net sales in 2003 sales for this segment increased 39 over the same period in 2002 favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 13 of the net sales gain the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn in 2002 contributed 89 to the net sales growth in 2003 this segments growth rate was affected by the closure of our contract manufacturing facility in 2003 which reduced the segment growth rate by approximately 32 the dst operating margin for 2003 was 133 compared to 170 in 2002 but improved sequentially from a low of 19 in the first quarter to a high of 193 in the fourth quarter of 2003 this segment reported solid sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 as spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies improved during the later part of 2003 our development services group recovered from the slower demand for toxicology services that we experienced during late 2002 and early 2003 we believe there is still some excess capacity in certain segments of the market for outsourced development services and some price sensitivity but customer demand has increased from the low point we experienced in the first quarter of 2003 we added capacity in two of our facilities in 2003 and based on projected demand we expect to add both general and specialty toxicology capacity to accommodate market growth in 2005 and beyond this segment also reported solid sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 as spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies improved over the course of 2003 for the fourth quarter of 2003 the dst segment operating margin increased from 160 in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 193 primarily due to higher sales and cost savings we implemented in the second quarter of 2003 in january 2004 we acquired river valley farms rvf a privatelyheld medical device contract research business located near minneapolis minnesota one of the major medical device and cardiovascular research hubs in the world we have combined rvf with our existing nonclinical medical device testing business to form a new operating unit called interventional and surgical services iss we expect this new unit to continue to grow faster than the overall market for outsourced services 

continued research and development spending by pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and research institutions and funding of research by government agencies is critical to our continued success a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from customers at academic and research laboratories who are partially dependent on funding from government sources such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies we also derive revenue directly from government agencies our customers also include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our ability to continue to grow is also dependent upon these industries continuing to spend on research and development at rates close to or at historical levels and their willingness to outsource the products and services we provide while we believe that research and development spending will continue in 2004 to be at least consistent with the increases of the past few years our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by the biopharmaceutical industry academic institutions and government agencies 

the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show cost of products sold and services provided selling 

general and administrative expenses amortization and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 





in our consolidated statements of income we provide a breakdown of net sales and cost of sales between net products and services such information is reported irrespective of the business segment from which the sales were generated 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and assumptions some of those estimates can be subjective and complex consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable however we believe that given the current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such alternative judgments would materially impact the accompanying financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies are most effected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following 

• goodwill and other intangible assets • revenue recognition • pension plan accounting • income taxes and deferred tax assets goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of businesses we have acquired we have material intangible assets including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinitelived acquired 

intangibles the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition as well as the completion of annual impairment tests require significant management judgments and estimates these estimates are made based on among others consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant reviews of projected future income and statutory regulations the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations furthermore changes in business strategy andor market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets which could materially impact our results of operations we performed annual impairment tests in 2003 and concluded the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset balances were not impaired 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product and services sales recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreedupon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts revenue of agreedupon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed based on rates specified in the contract revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in accordance with procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period as of december 27 2003 we had recorded unbilled revenue of 159 million and deferred revenue of 308 million in the consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements within our service contracts 

pension plan accounting we have significant plan assets liabilities and expenses based on information provided by independent actuaries the actuaries use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries the assumed discount rate which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled is adjusted based on the change in the longterm treasury bond yield as of the measurement date as of december 27 2003 the discount rate for our us pension plan remained at 60 the estimated effect of a 05 movement in the discount rate would be to change pension expense by 05 million in 2004 

the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years during 2003 we lowered our expected return on plan assets to 85 from 90 for our us pension plan this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately 02 million in 2004 

income taxes and deferred tax assets as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet as part of our 1999 recapitalization transaction we elected under internal revenue code section 338h10 to treat the transaction as a purchase resulting in a stepup in the tax basis of the underlying assets the election resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 1999 in the amount of 995 million for the estimated future tax benefits associated with the increased tax basis of the assets the balance of this deferred tax asset as of december 27 2003 was 716 million 

we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance as of december 27 2003 a valuation allowance of 41 million existed on a total net 

deferred tax asset of 648 million to the extent we increase this valuation allowance in a period we must report the effect as additional tax provision in the consolidated statement of income a valuation allowance is currently set against deferred tax assets because management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income as of december 27 2003 earnings from nonus subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 696 million and accordingly no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon distribution of those earnings would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign countries however it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed earnings 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease our deferred tax assets and materially impact our results of operations furthermore in the event that actual results differ from managements estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

in the first quarter of 2004 the company began a reorganization of its european operations the purpose of the reorganization is to streamline the corporate legal structure in order to improve operating efficiency and cash management facilitate acquisitions and provide tax benefits the reorganization which will not involve reductions of personnel or facility closures is expected to result in a onetime noncash charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately 7900 primarily due to the writeoff of a deferred tax asset 

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

net sales net sales in 2003 were 6137 million an increase of 591 million or 107 from 5546 million in 2002 the increase in net sales was primarily due to the increase in sales in our rms segment during 2003 

research models  services in 2003 rms net sales were 4051 million an increase of 512 million or 145 compared to 3539 million in 2002 favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 56 to our net sales gain rms prices increased at certain geographical locations in a range up to 5 with the weighted average increase of approximately 3 increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately 5 to the net sales growth research model unit sales increased primarily due to increased demand for our higherpriced specialty units sales of our research model services increased in 2003 due to increased pricing the consolidation of our mexican joint venture and an increased market demand the rms increase was driven by basic research and biotechnology spending which drove greater demand for our services that support research models primarily transgenics and laboratory services this growth reflects the increasing number of new disease models being created and the corresponding need for sophisticated housing and related highvalue services 

development  safety testing in 2003 dst net sales were 2086 million an increase of 79 million or 39 from 2007 million in 2002 favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 13 to our net sales gain dst sales increased in 2003 primarily due to our 2002 acquisitions and an increase in in vitro safety testing sales partially offset by the impact of reduced market demand for toxicology services in early 2003 lower sales in our biosafety testing services business and the closure of our contract manufacturing facility the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn contributed 178 million or 89 to the net sales growth in 2003 during 2003 dst experienced pricing pressures due to decreased demand earlier in the year resulting in a nominal price decline for the year our development services group recovered from the slower demand for toxicology services we experienced during late 2002 and early 2003 we believe there is still some excess capacity in certain segments of the market for outsourced development services causing lingering price sensitivity 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2003 was 3801 million an increase of 345 million or 100 from 3456 million in 2002 cost of products sold and services provided in 2003 was 619 of net sales compared to 623 in 2002 the increase in cost of products sold and services provided was due primarily to adverse foreign currency exchange of approximately 4 increased product volume and general inflation the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies 

research models  services cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2003 was 2383 million an increase of 261 million or 123 compared to 2122 million in 2002 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales decreased to 588 in 2003 from 600 in 2002 the decrease in cost of product sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies mainly in north american and european research models and research models services 

development  safety testing cost of products sold and services provided for dst in 2003 was 1418 million an increase of 84 million or 63 compared to 1334 million in 2002 cost of products sold and services provided in 2003 increased to 680 of net sales compared to 665 of net sales in 2002 the increase in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to decreased sales of certain development services during early 2003 which created excess capacity partially offset by the cost savings initiatives we implemented in 2003 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 were 895 million an increase of 62 million or 74 from 833 million in 2002 selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 were 146 of net sales compared to 150 of net sales in 2002 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 was due primarily to adverse foreign currency exchange a full year of expenses related to the 2002 acquisitions and inflation partially offset by the cost savings initiatives we implemented in 2003 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our ability to manage our cost increases at a rate slightly lower than our sales growth 

research models  services selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2003 were 426 million an increase of 45 million or 118 compared to 381 million in 2002 selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 decreased to 105 of net sales compared to 108 of net sales in 2002 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our efforts to limit our expense growth 

development  safety testing selling general and administrative expenses for dst in 2003 were 314 million an increase of 08 million compared to 306 million in 2002 selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 were 150 of net sales compared to 153 in 2002 selling general 

and administrative expenses for 2003 were virtually flat due mainly to the cost savings initiatives we implemented at the beginning of 2003 partially offset by the full year effect of the acquisitions of springborn and biolabs 

unallocated corporate overhead unallocated corporate overhead which consists of various corporate expenses including those associated with executive salaries and departments such as corporate accounting legal and investor relations was 155 million in 2003 compared to 145 million in 2002 the increase in unallocated corporate overhead in 2003 was due to an increased pension expense of 20 million partially offset by lower bonuses for 2003 

other operating expenses income during 2003 we recorded a 37 million charge associated with the writedown of certain contract manufacturing assets also during 2003 our french subsidiaries settled a breach of contract claim they had asserted against a customer after legal and related expenses the net settlement amounted to a gain of approximately 29 million 

amortization of other intangibles amortization of other intangibles in 2003 was 49 million an increase of 15 million from 34 million in 2002 the increase was due to the full year of amortization of intangible assets that arose from our 2002 acquisitions of biolabs and springborn 

operating income operating income in 2003 was 1386 million an increase of 163 million or 133 from 1223 million in 2002 operating income in 2003 was 226 of net sales compared to 220 of net sales in 2002 

research models  services in 2003 operating income from our rms segment was 1264 million an increase of 237 million or 230 from 1027 million in 2002 operating income in 2003 increased to 312 of net sales compared to 290 of net sales in 2002 the increase in operating income in 2003 was primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margins primarily from improved capacity utilization along with stable selling general and administrative expenses and the settlement of the french lawsuit 

development  safety testing in 2003 operating income from our dst segment was 277 million a decrease of 64 million or 189 from 341 million in 2002 operating income from sales of dst in 2003 was 133 of net sales compared to 170 in 2002 the decrease in operating income in 2003 was primarily due to the decline in demand for these services which impacted gross margins a charge related to the writedown of certain contract manufacturing assets and a full year of amortization of intangibles related to the 2002 acquisitions partially offset by our cost containment program 

interest income interest income in 2003 was 18 million compared to 21 million in 2002 the lower interest income was due primarily to lower interest rates 

interest expense interest expense in 2003 was 85 million compared to 112 million in 2002 the 27 million decrease was primarily due to the early retirement of debt 

loss on debt retirement in 2002 we recorded a loss of 299 million relating to premiums paid and the writeoff of deferred financing costs and issuance discount in connection with the tender offer for all of our remaining 135 senior subordinated notes other debt repayments and the termination of our revolving credit facility 

other income other income for 2003 was 08 million compared to 12 million for 2002 the decrease was primarily due to lower net foreign currency gains then in 2002 

income taxes the effective tax rate for 2003 was 385 compared to the 2002 rate of 378 which included a 05 million benefit associated with the release of a valuation allowance in 2002 during 2002 we reassessed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with state net 

operating loss carryforwards due to state tax planning initiatives and the completion of the 2001 state income tax returns 

net income net income in 2003 was 802 million an increase of 301 million or 599 from 501 million in 2002 

fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 

net sales net sales in 2002 were 5546 million an increase of 890 million or 191 from 4656 million in 2001 

research models and services in 2002 net sales from our rms segment were 3539 million an increase of 765 million or 276 from 2774 million in 2001 favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately 08 to our net sales gain rms global prices increased in a range up to 5 with the average approximately 3 increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately 24 to net sales increase sales of our research models increased due to an increase in unit volume and a shift in demand to higherpriced research models additional sales from our 2001 acquisition of genetic models inc gmi and increased sales of unique specialty models through our cooperative agreement with the jackson laboratory sales of our research model services increased in 2002 due to strong sales growth from our transgenics and contract staffing businesses increased pricing and the consolidation of our mexican joint venture 

development  safety testing in 2002 net sales from our dst segment were 2007 million an increase of 124 million or 66 compared to 1883 million in 2001 the increase was due to continued growth in outsourcing in the pharmaceutical industry expanded in vitro sales and the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn which contributed 97 million or 51 partially offset by reduced business at our contract manufacturing facility 

cost of products sold and services provided cost of products sold and services provided in 2002 was 3456 million an increase of 472 million or 158 from 2984 million in 2001 cost of products sold and services provided in 2002 was 623 of net sales compared to 641 in 2001 with the improvement due to operating improvements in both rms and dst the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies 

research models and services cost of products sold and services provided for rms in 2002 was 2122 million an increase of 435 million or 258 compared to 1687 million in 2001 cost of products sold and services provided in 2002 improved to 600 of net sales compared to 608 of net sales in 2001 the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies in europe due to the closure of one of our facilities in france in 2001 

development  safety testing cost of products sold and services provided for dst in 2002 was 1334 million an increase of 37 million or 29 compared to 1297 million in 2001 cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was 665 in 2002 compared to 689 in 2001 the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to greater operating efficiencies 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 833 million an increase of 150 million or 219 from 683 million in 2001 selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 150 of net sales compared to 147 of net sales in 2001 the increase was due primarily to expenses associated with corporate overhead the 2002 acquisitions and foreign exchange the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of 

net sales was primarily due to the increase in unallocated corporate overhead partially offset by improvements in selling general and administrative expenses in rms 

research models and services selling general and administrative expenses for rms in 2002 were 381 million an increase of 17 million or 48 compared to 364 million in 2001 selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 108 of net sales compared to 131 in 2001 the decrease in selling general and administrative as a percentage of sales in 2002 was principally due to cost savings from greater economies of scale and a charge of 15 million associated with the closure of one of our french facilities in 2001

the company recorded the balance of the net deferred tax asset on the belief that it is more likely than not that it will be realized this belief is based upon a review of all available evidence including historical operating results projections of taxable income and tax planning strategies 

during 2002 in conjunction with the state tax planning initiatives and the completion of the 2001 state income tax returns during the third quarter of 2002 the company reassessed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the reassessment 473 of the valuation allowance was released and recorded as a tax benefit 

in connection with the 1999 recapitalization transaction the company elected under internal revenue code section 338h10 to treat the transaction as a purchase resulting in a stepup in the tax basis of the underlying assets the election resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset in 1999 net of valuation allowance of approximately 99506 for the estimated future tax benefits associated with the increased tax basis of the assets for financial reporting purposes the benefit was treated as a contribution to capital in 1999 as of december 27 2003 the net deferred tax asset pertaining to the election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code was 71642 the company expects to realize the net benefit of the deferred tax asset over a 15 year period from the date of the 1999 recapitalization transaction through annual tax deductions which are expected to reduce future tax payments it is possible that the internal revenue service irs may challenge the availability of the section 338h10 election to the company as a result of the companys reorganization in connection with the initial public offering in 2000 if the irs were successful the expected future tax benefits from the election would not be available and the company would be required to write off the related deferred tax assets by recording a nonrecurring expense in the results of operations in an amount equal to such deferred tax assets the company believes that the reorganization and liquidating distribution should not have any impact upon the election for federal income tax purposes however the irs may reach a different conclusion

in vitro technology we have diversified our product offerings to include nonanimal or in vitro methods for testing the safety of drugs and devices we are strategically committed to being the leader in providing our customers with in vitro alternatives as these methods become scientifically validated and commercially feasible our current products include endotoxin detection systems that ensure that injectable drugs and devices are free from harmful contaminants as well as a proprietary molecular assay that is currently being validated for use in the screening of new drugs in vitro for phototoxicity and photocarcinogenicity 

vaccine support products we provide vaccine manufacturers with pathogenfree fertilized chicken eggs a critical ingredient for poultry vaccine production we believe there may be significant potential for growth in this area in support of novel human vaccines such as a nasal spray flu vaccine currently in development 

research models we are the global leader in the production and sale of research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats and mice these products represented 42 of our 2001 net sales we offer nearly 150 research models one of the largest selections of small animal models of any provider worldwide our higher growth models include genetically defined models and models with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as earlystage research tools the fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates and many medical devices to be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a result our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process our research models are produced in a biosecure environment designed to ensure that the animals are free of viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results with our biosecure production capabilities and our ability to deliver consistent high quality research models worldwide we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the national institutes of health 

competitive strengths 

our leading research models business has provided us with steadily growing revenues and strong cash flow while our biomedical products and services business provides significant opportunities for profitable growth our products and services are critical to both traditional pharmaceutical research and the rapidly growing fields of genomic recombinant protein and humanized antibody research we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in all of these sectors as a result of a diverse set of competitive strengths which include 

critical products and services we provide critical proven and enabling products and services that our customers rely upon to advance their earlystage research efforts and accelerate product development we offer a wide array of complementary research tools and discovery and development services that differentiate us from our competition and have created a sustained competitive advantage in our markets 

longstanding reputation for scientific excellence we have earned our longstanding reputation for scientific excellence by consistently delivering highquality research models supported by exceptional technical service and support for over 50 years as a result the charles river brand name is synonymous with premium quality products and services and scientific excellence in the life sciences we have nearly 250 science professionals on staff with dvms phds and mds in areas including laboratory animal medicine molecular biology pathology immunology toxicology and pharmacology 

extensive global infrastructure and customer relationships our operations are globally integrated throughout north america europe and asia our extensive investment in worldwide infrastructure allows us to standardize our products and services across borders when required by our multinational 

customers while also offering a customized local presence when needed we currently operate 77 facilities in 15 countries worldwide serving a customer base spanning more than 50 countries 

biosecurity technology expertise in our research models business our commitment to and expert knowledge of biosecurity technology distinguishes us from our competition we maintain rigorous biosecurity standards in all of our facilities to maintain the health profile and consistency of our research models these qualities are crucial to the integrity and timeliness of our customers research 

platform acquisition and internal development capabilities we have a proven track record of successfully identifying acquiring and developing complementary businesses and new technologies with this experience we have developed internal expertise in sourcing acquisitions and further developing new technologies we believe this expertise will continue to differentiate us from our competitors as we seek to further expand our business 

experienced and incentivized management team our senior management team has an average of nearly 20 years of experience with our company and has evidenced a strong commitment and capability to deliver reliable performance and steady growth our chairman and chief executive officer james c foster has been with us for 26 years as of december 29 2001 our management team owns or has options to acquire securities representing approximately 44 of our equity on a fully diluted basis 

our strategy 

our business strategy is to build upon our core research model business and to actively invest in higher growth opportunities where our proven capabilities and strong relationships allow us to achieve and maintain a leadership position our growth strategies include 

broaden the scope of our discovery and development services primarily through acquisitions and alliances we have improved our ability to offer new services that complement our existing drug discovery and development services we have targeted services that support transgenic research activities as a high growth area we intend to provide the additional critical support services needed to create define characterize and scientifically validate new genetic models expected to arise out of the human genome and mouse genome projects in addition we plan to broaden our international presence in genetic services specialized pathology and drug efficacy analysis we also continue to add new capabilities in the biotech safety testing area 

expand our preclinical outsourcing services many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers outsource a wide variety of research activities that are not directly associated with their scientific innovation process we believe the trend of outsourcing preclinical or earlystage research will continue to increase rapidly we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities principally through our discovery and development services offerings we believe our early successes in the transgenic services area have increased customer demand for outsourcing and have created significant opportunities our research support services provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with significant cost and resource allocation advantages over their existing internal operations we intend to focus our marketing efforts on stimulating demand for further outsourcing of preclinical research we also intend to expand our opportunities by increasing our international presence 

pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances over the past decade we have completed 18 acquisitions and alliances several of our operations began as platform acquisitions which we were able to grow rapidly by developing and marketing the acquired products or services to our extensive global customer base we intend to further pursue strategic platform acquisitions to drive our longterm growth 

expand our nonanimal technologies in vitro testing technologies are in their early stages of development but we plan to continue to acquire and introduce new in vitro products and services as they become scientifically validated and commercially viable we are particularly focused on acquiring new technologies that allow for high throughput screening and testing of new drug candidates in the early stages of development using such techniques as cell and tissue cultures 

acquire new technologies in research models we have acquired and intend to acquire novel technologies in transgenics and cloning to increase sales in our research models business and related transgenic services operations we also expect to offer additional genetically modified models for research of specific disease conditions these highervalue research models are often highly specialized and are priced to reflect their greater intrinsic value in particular we intend to acquire and develop transgenic rat technology where development has been slow compared to mice we believe there is a growing need for genetically engineered rats which are larger and more accessible research models than mice

discovery represents the earliest stages of research and development in the life sciences directed to the identification and selection of a lead compound for future drug development discovery is followed by development activities which are directed at validation of the selected drug candidates discovery and development represent most of the preclinical activities in drug development 

initiated in 1995 the discovery services area of our business addresses the growing need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the noncore aspects of their drug discovery activities these discovery services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business we currently offer four major categories of discovery services transgenic services research support services infectious disease and genetic testing and contract site management 

transgenic services in this rapidly growing area of our business we assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing models purchased or created by them for 

biomedical research activities while the creation of a transgenic knockout or cloned model can be a critical scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive utilization of research models requires significant additional technical expertise we provide transgenic breeding expertise model characterization and colony development genetic characterization quarantine embryo cryopreservation embryo transfer rederivation and health and genetic monitoring we provide these services to nearly 200 laboratories around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities we maintain more than 1000 different types of research models for our customers we expect that the demand for our services will grow as the use of transgenic knockout and cloned animal models continues to grow within the research community 

research support services our research support services provide advanced or specialized research model studies for our customers these projects capitalize on our strong research model capabilities and also exploit more recently developed capabilities in protocol development animal microsurgery dosing techniques drug effectiveness testing and data management and analysis we believe these services particularly in oncology and cardiovascular studies offer added value to our research customers who rely on our extensive expertise infrastructure and resources we also manage under contract a genetically defined biosecure herd of miniature swine to provide organs for human transplantation research known as xenotransplantation 

infectious disease and genetic testing we assist our customers in monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its sole source testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in development and utilization of transgenic knockout and cloned models will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for genetic testing of special models 

contract site management building upon our core capabilities as a leading provider of high quality research models we manage animal care operations on behalf of government academic pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations increasing demand for our services reflects the growing necessity of these large institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical to the core scientific innovation and discovery process in addition we believe that our expertise in managing the laboratory animal environment enhances the productivity and quality of our customers research facilities this area leads to additional opportunities for us to provide other products and services to our customers site management does not require us to make any incremental investment thereby generating a particularly strong return 

development services 

our development services enable our customers to outsource their noncore drug development activities to us these activities are typically required for the identification of the lead compound and to support the regulatory filings necessary to obtain fda approval the demand for these services is driven by the growing outsourcing trend in preclinical drug development we currently offer development services in eight main areas pharmacokinetic and metabolic analysis bioanalytial chemistry pharmacologic surgery specialty toxicology medical device testing pathology services biopharmaceutical production and biotech safety testing 

pharmacokinetic and metabolic analysis charles rivers scientists conduct pharmacokinetic studies to determine the mechanisms by which drugs function in mammalian systems to produce therapeutic effects as well as to understand how drugs may produce undesirable or toxic effects our scientists also conduct metabolic studies to reveal how drugs are broken down and excreted and the duration that drugs or their byproducts remain in various organs and tissues these studies can be 

performed as part of the drug screening process to help identify lead compounds as well as later in the development process to provide information regarding safety and efficacy 

bioanalytial chemistry our bioanalytical chemistry services support all phases of drug development from discovery to nonclinical studies and clinical trials our researchers design and conduct leadoptimization projects develop and validate methods used to analyze samples conduct protein binding studies and perform dose formulation analysis 

pharmacologic surgery many sophisticated drugs are designed to be administered directly to a precise location within the body using surgical or invasive techniques the development of these and certain other drugs requires the use of surgical techniques to administer a drug or to observe its effects in various tissues charles rivers pharmacologic surgery program offers extensive capabilities in this area and has developed numerous research models in collaboration with worldrenowned experts in the fields of cardiology inflammation and pathology at leading academic institutions 

specialty toxicology our team of scientists including toxicologists pathologists and regulatory specialists designs and performs highly specialized studies to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new pharmaceutical compounds and materials used in medical devices charles river is an industry leader in the fields of reproductive and developmental toxicology photobiology and other specialty toxicological assessments 

medical device testing the fda requires companies introducing medical devices to test the biocompatibility of any new materials that have not previously been approved for contact with human tissue we provide a wide variety of medical device testing services from prototype feasibility testing to longterm glp or good laboratory practices studies primarily in large research models these services include cardiovascular surgery biomaterial reactivity studies orthopedic studies and related laboratory services we maintain stateoftheart surgical suites where our skilled professional staff implement custom surgery protocols provided by our customers 

pathology services in the drug development process the ability to identify and characterize pathologic changes within tissues and cells is critical in determining the safety of a new compound charles river employs highly trained pathologists who use stateoftheart techniques to reveal pathology within tissues and cells as well as at the molecular level frequently decisions regarding continued product development are dependent on these pathology findings 

biotech safety testing we provide specialized nonclinical quality control testing that is frequently outsourced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies these services allow our customers to determine if the human protein drug candidates or the process for manufacturing those products are essentially free of residual biological materials the bulk of this testing work is required by the fda for obtaining new drug approval maintaining an fdalicensed manufacturing capability or releasing approved products for use on patients our scientific staff consults with customers in the areas of process development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing as more biotechnology drug candidates with stronger potential enter and exit the development pipeline we expect to continue to experience strong demand for these testing services 

biopharmaceutical production charles river has the capability to costeffectively develop and manufacture drugs in small quantities that are needed for early and midstage clinical trials we maintain multiple cleanroom processing suites designed for the production of clinical products as well as integrated testing services for inprocess and product release testing our manufacturing facilities operate under strict cgmp guidelines and are supported by a strong quality assurance control and regulatory compliance system 

in vitro technology 

while the scientific community does not foresee significant replacement of animal models from the use of in vitro techniques we believe that these techniques may offer a strong refinement or complement to animal test systems after the extended period of scientific validation is successfully completed we intend to pursue this area to the extent alternatives become commercially viable 

endotoxin detection systems we are a market leader in endotoxin testing which is used to test quality control samples of injectable drugs and devices their components and the processes under which they are manufactured for the presence of endotoxins endotoxins are fever producing pathogens or compounds that are highly toxic to humans when sufficient quantities are introduced into the body quality control testing for endotoxin contamination by our customers is an fda requirement for injectable drugs and devices and the manufacture of the test kits and reagents is regulated by the fda as a medical device endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab known as limulus amebocyte lysate or lal the lal test is the first and only major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test for endotoxin detection in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing the process of extracting blood is not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment we produce and distribute test kits reagents software accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for medical devices and other products worldwide we have recently received a patent relating to our next generation of endotoxin testing technology 

in vitro safety screening in 2002 charles river acquired dak dak an in vitro technology platform that can help researchers predict whether the active ingredients in skin care products and cosmetics are likely to be effective in preventing skin aging caused by sunlight the platform includes a molecular assay that measures the activity of the human gene for elastin a protein produced within skin cells following their exposure to sunlight we are currently working to validate the technology for use as a rapid screening tool to help identify drugs that are likely to make patients more susceptible to skin cancer and other suninduced skin problems 

vaccine support products 

animal health we are the global leader for the supply of specific pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the manufacturing of live and killed viruses these viruses are used as a raw material in poultry and potential human vaccine applications the production of spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar to our research model production we have a worldwide presence that includes several spf egg production facilities in the united states as well as facilities in germany and in australia we have a joint venture in mexico and a franchise in india we also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides inhouse testing and support services to our customers 

human health we are also applying our spf egg technology to human vaccine markets we have entered into an agreement with a company that is in the late stages of the fda approval process for a nasal spraydelivered vaccine for human flu if fdaapproved and commercially successful this human flu vaccine may significantly increase demand for our spf eggs 

research models 

research models is our historical core business and accounted for 42 of our 2001 net sales the business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of animal research models principally purposebred rats mice and other rodents for use by researchers we are the commercial leader in the small animal research model area supplying rodents for research since 1947 our research models include 

• outbred animals which have genetic characteristics of a random population • inbred animals which have essentially identical genes • hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents • spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency and • transgenic animals which contain genetic material transferred from another source with nearly 150 research models we offer one of the largest selections of small animal models and provide our customers with high volume and high quality production our rats mice and other rodent species such as guinea pigs and hamsters have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality in the breeding process we provide our small animal models to numerous customers around the world including all major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as hospitals and academic institutions 

the use of animal models is critical to both the discovery and development of a new drug the fda requires safe and effective testing on two species of animal models one small and one large before moving into the clinic for testing on humans animal testing is used in order to identify define characterize and assess the safety of new drug candidates increasingly genetically defined rats and mice are the model of choice in early discovery and development work as a more specifically targeted research tool outbred rats are frequently used in safety assessment studies our models are also used in life science research within universities hospitals and other research institutions unlike drug discovery these uses are generally not specifically mandated by regulatory agencies such as the fda but instead are governed by the terms of government grants institutional protocols as well as the scientific inquiry and peer review publication processes we also provide larger animal models including miniature swine and primates to the research community principally for use in drug development and testing studies 

we believe that over the next several years many new research models will be developed and used in biomedical research such as transgenic models cloned models with identical genes knockout models with one or more disabled genes and models that incorporate or exclude a particular mouse rat or human gene these more highly defined and characterized models will allow researchers to further focus their investigations into disease conditions and potential new therapies or interventions we intend to build upon our position as the leader in transgenic services to expand our presence in this market for higher value models through internal development licensing partnerships and alliances and acquisitions 

in 2001 we entered into a strategic partnership with the jackson laboratory jackson an internationally renowned research institution that develops unique genetically engineered mouse models for use in medical research drug discovery and development work under this partnership charles river will produce and distribute jacksons research models in europe and asia the partnership combines jacksons strength in genetic science with the global production and distribution capabilities of charles river we view this relationship as an important step toward broadening the scope of our research models business 

also in 2001 charles river acquired genetic models inc which has developed proprietary and diseasespecific rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease and kidney disease the acquisition is part of an ongoing effort to strengthen charles rivers portfolio of diseasespecific animal research models 

customers 

our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical companies including the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies based on 2001 revenues as well as biotechnology animal health medical device and diagnostic companies and hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have many longterm stable relationships with our customers as evidenced by the fact that all of our top 20 customers in 1990 remain our customers today 

during 2001 in both our research models and our biomedical products and services businesses more than threequarters of our sales were to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the balance were to hospitals universities and the government our top 20 global commercial customers represent only about 300 of our 2001 net sales with no individual customer accounting for more than 30 of net sales 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force the majority of whom work in the united states with the balance working in europe and japan the direct sales force is supplemented by a network of international distributors for some areas of our biomedical products and services business 

our internal marketing groups support the field sales staff while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers in the biomedical research industry our web site wwwcrivercom is an effective marketing tool and has become recognized as a valuable resource in the laboratory animal field by a broad spectrum of industry leaders recording over several hundred thousand hits each month 

we maintain both customer service and technical assistance departments which service our customers routine and more specialized needs we frequently assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and genetics biosecurity protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is recognized as a valuable customer resource 

research and development 

we do not maintain a fully dedicated research and development staff rather this work is done on an individual project basis or through collaborations with universities or other institutions our dedicated research and development spending was 05 million in 1999 09 million in 2000 and 19 million in 2001 our approach to developing new products or services is to extend our base technologies into new applications and fields and to license or acquire technologies to serve as a platform for the development of new businesses that service our existing customer base our research and development focus is principally on developing projects that improve our productivity or processes 

in 2001 we entered into rd collaborations with two universities and two biotechnology companies 

• medical college of wisconsin to distribute their proprietary consomic rat models these research models are generated by substituting whole chromosomes into a rat strain allowing multiple genes on the chromosome to be studied for their combined role in conditions such as hypertension myocardial infarction and renal disease 9 

• sangamo biosciences inc to apply sangamos novel gene regulation technologies to the creation of transgenic rat research models for use in developing new drugs and therapies for cancer • tufts university school of veterinary medicine to develop a novel cloning technology applied to immunodeficient mice and advanced cell technology inc to develop cloned and transgenic rat models industry support and animal welfare 

among the shared values of our employees is a concern for and commitment to animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to demonstrate our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical area of our business 

we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community we fund internships in laboratory animal medicine provide financial support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field one of our businesses dedicates a portion of its net sales through a royalty to support similar programs and initiatives 

employees 

as of december 29 2001 we had more than 4000 employees including nearly 250 science professionals with advanced degrees including dvms phds and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states although employees are unionized in some european locales consistent with local custom for our industry we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees 

competition 

our strategy is to be the leader in each of the markets in which we participate our competitors are generally different in each of our business and geographic areas 

in our research models business division our main competitors include three smaller competitors in north america several smaller ones in europe and two smaller ones in japan of our main united states competitors two are privately held businesses and the third is a governmentfinanced nonprofit institution we believe that none of our competitors for research models has our comparable global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships 

we have many competitors in our biomedical products and services business division a few of our competitors in our biomedical products and services business are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or other resources than we do however many are smaller and more regionalized we have a small relative share in the biotech safety testing market where the market leader is a wellestablished company and in medical device testing where there are many larger competitors 

we generally compete on the basis of quality reputation and availability which is supported by our international presence with strategically located facilities 

regulatory matters 

the animal welfare act awa governs the treatment of particular species intended for use in research the awa imposes a wide variety of specific regulations on producers and users of these 

species most notably cage size shipping conditions and environmental enrichment methods we comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the usda for handling regulated species including breeding maintenance and transportation however rats mice and chickens are not currently regulated under the awa congress is considering legislation which would permanently exclude these species from regulation under the awa as a result most of our united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa our animal production facilities in the united states are accredited by a highly regarded member association known as aaalac which maintains standards that often exceed those of the usda 

our biomedical products and services business is also generally regulated by the usda and in the case of our endotoxin detection systems the fda our manufacture of test kits and reagents for endotoxin testing is subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the federal food drug and cosmetic act we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the fdas quality system regulations and good manufacturing practices these regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing testing and control activities in 1999 we received a warning letter from the fda for quality control deficiencies with regard to our charleston south carolina facility we have since taken corrective action satisfactory to the fda with respect to these deficiencies 

factors affecting future operating results 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements you can identify these statements by forwardlooking words such as may will expect anticipate believe estimate and continue or similar words you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition or state forwardlooking information we believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors however there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors including but not limited to our success in selecting and integrating businesses and technology we acquire contaminations at our facilities changes in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries competition and changes in government regulations or general economic or market conditions these factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forwardlooking statements we are under no duty to update any of the forwardlooking statements after the date of this annual report or to conform these statements to actual results 

industry and market data 

in this annual report on form 10k we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the research model and biomedical products and services industries and our market share in the sectors in which we compete we obtained this information and statistics from various third party sources discussions with our customers andor our own internal estimates we believe that these sources and estimates are reliable but we have not independently verified them 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire our business may suffer 

we have recently expanded our business through the acquisitions of pathology associates international corporation or pai and primedica corporation or primedica and we plan to continue 

to grow our business through acquisitions of businesses and technologies and the formation of alliances however businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating operations services products or technologies • difficulties in developing and operating new businesses including diversion of managements attention from other business concerns • the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and difficulties in attracting new employees to grow businesses • difficulties in assimilating differences in foreign business practices and overcoming language barriers • difficulties in obtaining intellectual property protections and skills that we and our employees currently do not have and • difficulties in achieving business and financial success in the event that the success of an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet expectations we may be required to restructure we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business or successfully exploit new business or technologies 

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of contaminants such as viruses and bacteria the presence of contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results contaminations in our isolated breeding rooms or poultry houses could disrupt our contaminantfree research model and fertile egg production harm our reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales 

contaminations typically require cleaning up the contaminated room or poultry house this cleanup results in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments these contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict we experienced several material contaminations in our animal populations in 1996 and a few significant contaminations in 1997 that adversely impacted our 1996 and 1997 financial results since then we have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly changed our operating procedures we have not experienced any significant contaminations since 1997 

many of our customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we are subject to risks uncertainties and trends that affect companies in those industries 

sales of our products and services are highly dependent on research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we are therefore subject to risks uncertainties and trends that affect companies in those industries including government regulation pricing pressure technological change and shifts in the focus and scope of research and development expenditures for example over the past several years the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant mergers and combinations and many industry experts expect this trend to continue after recent mergers and combinations some customers combined or otherwise reduced their research and development operations resulting in fewer animal research activities we experienced both temporary disruptions and permanent reductions in sales of our research models to some of these customers future mergers and combinations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries or other industrywide trends could adversely affect demand for or pricing of our products 

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services 

for many years groups within the scientific and research community have attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research companies have developed several techniques that have scientific merit especially in the area of cosmetics and household product testing markets in which we are not active only a few alternative test methods in the discovery and development of effective and safe treatments for human and animal disease conditions have been validated and successfully deployed the principal validated nonanimal test system is the lal or endotoxin detection system a technology which we acquired and have aggressively marketed as an alternative to testing in animals it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any nonanimal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets however these methods may not be available to us or we may not be successful in commercializing these methods even if we are successful sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models 

alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales in addition one of the anticipated outcomes of genomics research is to permit the elimination of more compounds prior to preclinical testing while this outcome may not occur for several years if at all it may reduce the demand for some of our products and services 

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and nonclinical stages of drug discovery and development meaning contracting out to others functions that were previously performed internally may decrease which could slow our growth 

some areas of our biomedical products and services business have grown significantly as a result of the increase over the past several years in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and nonclinical research support activities while industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a substantial decrease in preclinical and nonclinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected higher growth areas 

our business may be affected by changes in the animal welfare act and related regulations which may require us to alter our operations 

the united states department of agriculture or usda has agreed as part of a settlement of litigation to propose a change to the regulations issued under the animal welfare act to include rats mice and birds including chickens congress however has suspended the usdas rulemaking authority in this area and is considering legislation which would permanently exclude these species from regulation under the animal welfare act the animal welfare act imposes a wide variety of specific regulations on producers and users of regulated species including cage size shipping conditions and environmental enrichment methods depending on whether the final rulemaking in this area includes rats mice and birds including chickens we could be required to alter our production operations this may include adding production capacity new equipment and additional employees we believe that application of the animal welfare act to rats mice and chickens used in our research model and vaccine support products operations in the united states will not result in loss of net sales margin or market share since all us producers and users will be subject to the same regulations while we do not anticipate that the addition of rats mice and chickens to the animal welfare act would require significant expenditures changes to the regulations may be more stringent than we expect and require more significant expenditures additionally if we fail to comply with state regulations including general anticruelty legislation foreign laws and other anticruelty laws we could face significant civil and criminal penalties 

factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and increased international and us regulatory requirements may increase our costs of doing business in foreign countries 

a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the united states our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates uncertainties related to regional economic circumstances and the costs of complying with a wide variety of international and us regulatory requirements 

because the sales and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar in the reported results of our foreign operations these fluctuations may decrease our earnings we currently do not hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

we face significant competition in our business and if we are unable to respond to competition in our business our revenues may decrease 

we face significant competition from different competitors in each of our business areas some of our competitors in biotech safety testing and medical device testing are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or other resources than we do we generally compete on the basis of quality reputation and availability of service expansion by our competitors into other areas in which we operate new entrants into our markets or changes in our competitors strategy could adversely affect our competitive position any erosion of our competitive position may decrease our revenues or limit our growth 

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 

our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not historically been the subject of animal rights media attention however the large animal component of our business has been the subject of adverse attention and onsite protests we closed our small import facility in england due in part to protests by animal right activists which included threats against our facilities and employees future negative attention or threats against our facilities or employees could impair our business 

one of our large animal operations is dependent on a single source of supply which if interrupted could adversely affect our business 

we depend on a single international source of supply for one of our large animal operations disruptions to their continued supply may arise from export or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability or severe weather conditions any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary source on comparable commercial terms 

tax benefits we expect to be available in the future may be subject to challenge 

in connection with the recapitalization our shareholders crl acquisition llc and bausch  lomb incorporated or bl made a joint election intended to permit us to increase the depreciable and amortizable tax basis in our assets for federal income tax purposes thereby providing us with expected future tax benefits in connection with our initial public offering crl acquisition llc reorganized terminated its existence as a corporation for tax purposes and distributed a substantial portion of our stock to its members it is possible that the internal revenue service may contend that this reorganization and liquidating distribution should be integrated with our original recapitalization we believe that the reorganization and liquidating distribution should not have any impact upon the election for federal income tax purposes however the internal revenue service may reach a different conclusion if the internal revenue service were successful the expected future tax benefits would not 

be available and we would be required to write off the related deferred tax asset reflected in our balance sheet by recording a nonrecurring tax expense in our results of operations in an amount equal to such deferred tax asset 

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief executive officer since 1992 has held various positions with charles river for 25 years and recently became our chairman we have no employment agreement with mr foster nor with any other executive officer if mr foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions our business may suffer 

because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm our business 

our historical financial information may not be representative of our results as a separate company 

the historical financial information in this annual report on form 10k for the periods prior to the recapitalization may not reflect what our results of operations financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone company during the periods presented we made some adjustments and allocations to the historical financial statements for the periods prior to the recapitalization included in this annual report on form 10k because bl did not account for us as a single standalone business in those periods our adjustments and allocations made in preparing our historical consolidated financial statements may not appropriately reflect our operations during the periods presented as if we had operated as a standalone company

 item 3 legal proceedings 

our operations and properties are subject to extensive foreign and federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern among other things the generation storage handling use and transportation of hazardous materials and the handling and disposal of hazardous and biohazardous waste generated at our facilities under such laws and regulations we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators under some environmental laws and regulations we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites as a result of disputes with federal state and local authorities and private environmental groups regarding damage to mangrove plants on two islands in the florida keys we agreed to refoliate the islands at our cost although we have not been able to completely replant principally due to the presence of a freerange animal population and storms we believe that the cost of refoliation will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we believe that our costs of complying with current and future environmental laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you that they will not do so 

we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that is not material to our business or financial condition

 item 5 market for registrants common equity and related stockholder matters 

the companys common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on june 23 2000 under the symbol crl the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below closing prices for our common stock as reported on the nyse composite tape 







stockholders 

as of march 12 2002 there were approximately 116 stockholders of record of the outstanding shares of common stock 

dividends 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the past three years except to our former parent company and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain any earnings to finance future operations and expansion and to reduce indebtedness we are a holding company and are dependent on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our cash requirements the terms of the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us and consequently restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 




 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

overview 

we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in this business for more than 50 years 

we have two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes research models and biomedical products and services in addition since services represent over 10 of our net sales our consolidated statements of income also provide a breakdown of net sales between net sales related to products which include both research models and biomedical products and net sales related to services which reflect biomedical services and a breakdown of costs between costs of products sold and costs of services provided the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of our reportable segments for the past three years they also show costs of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative expenses and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales 





results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that effect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgements including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes financing obligations restructuring costs retirement benefits and litigation management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

we also have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the cash flows received from our foreign affiliates this risk is mitigated by the fact that their operations are conducted in their respective local currencies currently we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations fas 141 and no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 142 fas 141 supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 16 business combination the provisions of fas 141 i require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 ii provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and iii require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized fas 141 also requires that upon adoption of fas 142 the company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria fas 142 supersedes apb 17 intangible assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 fas 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition the provisions of fas 142 i prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets ii require that goodwill and indefinitelive intangible assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets may be impaired iii require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and iv remove the fortyyear limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 

the company will adopt the provisions of fas 142 in its first quarter ended march 30 2002 the company is in the process of preparing for its adoption of fas 142 and is making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill intangible assets other assets and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units in connection with the adoption of fas 142 the company will reclassify approximately 174 million of assembled workforce from other intangible assets into goodwill and will no longer record approximately 63 million of amortization relating to its existing goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

fas 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a twostep process the first step is to identify a potential impairment and in transition this step must be measured as of the 

beginning of the fiscal year however a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step the company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2002 the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption if any and must be completed by the end of the companys fiscal year intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a onestep process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year and pursuant to the requirements of fas 142 will be completed during the first quarter of 2002 any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the second quarter of 2002 the company has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the companys earnings and financial position

    research models  we are the global leader in the production and sale of
research models principally genetically and virally defined purposebred rats
and mice these products represented 612 of our 2000 net sales we offer over
130 research models one of the largest selections of small animal models of any
provider worldwide our highergrowth models include genetically defined models
and models with compromised immune systems which are increasingly in demand as
earlystage research tools the fda and foreign regulatory bodies typically
require the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates and many medical devices
to be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans as a
result our research models are an essential part of the drugdiscovery and
development process our research models are produced in a biosecure environment
designed to ensure that the animals are free of viral and bacterial agents and
other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results
with our biosecure production capabilities and our ability to deliver
consistent high quality research models worldwide we are well positioned to
benefit from the rapid growth in research and development spending by

our strategy

    our business strategy is to build upon our core research model business and
to actively invest in highergrowth opportunities where our proven capabilities
and strong relationships allow us to achieve and maintain a leadership position
our growth strategies include

    broaden the scope of our discovery and development services  primarily
through acquisitions and alliances we have improved our ability to offer new
services that complement our existing drugdiscovery and development services
we have targeted services that support transgenic research activities as a
highgrowth area we intend to provide the additional critical support services
needed to create define characterize and scientifically validate new genetic
models expected to arise out of the human genome and mouse genome projects in
addition we plan to broaden our international presence in genetic services
specialized pathology and drug efficacy analysis we also continue to add new
capabilities in the biotech safety testing area

    acquire new technologies in research models  we intend to acquire novel
technologies in transgenics and cloning to increase sales in our research models
business and related transgenic services operations we also expect to offer
additional genetically modified models for research of specific disease
conditions these highervalue research models are often highly specialized and
are priced to reflect their greater intrinsic value in particular we intend to
acquire and develop transgenic rat technology where development has been slow
compared to mice we believe there is a growing need for genetically engineered
rats which are larger and more accessible research models than mice

    expand our preclinical outsourcing services  many of our pharmaceutical and
biotechnology customers outsource a wide variety of research activities that are
not directly associated with their scientific innovation process we believe the
trend of outsourcing preclinical or earlystage research will continue to
increase rapidly we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new
outsourcing opportunities principally through our discovery and development
services offerings we believe our early successes in the transgenic services
area have increased customer demand for outsourcing and have created significant
opportunities our research support services provide pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies with significant cost and resource allocation advantages
over their existing internal operations we intend to focus our marketing
efforts on stimulating demand for further outsourcing of preclinical research
we also intend to expand our opportunities by increasing our international
presence

    expand our nonanimal technologies  in vitro testing technologies are in
their early stages of development but we plan to continue to acquire and
introduce new in vitro products and services as they become scientifically
validated and commercially viable we are particularly focused on acquiring new
technologies that allow for high throughput screening and testing of new drug
candidates in early stages of development using such materials and techniques
as human cells and tissues and predictive database software

    pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances  over the past decade we have
successfully completed 14 acquisitions and alliances several of our operations
began as platform acquisitions which we were able to grow rapidly by developing
and marketing the acquired products or services to our extensive global customer
base we intend to further pursue strategic platform acquisitions and alliances
to drive our longterm growth

business divisions

    our business is divided into two segments research models and biomedical
products and services

research models

    research models is our historical core business and accounted for 612 of
our 2000 net sales and 659 of our 1999 net sales the business is comprised of
the commercial production and sale of animal research models principally
purposebred rats mice and other rodents for use by researchers we are the
commercial leader in the small animal research model area supplying rodents for
research since 1947 our research models include

     outbred animals which have genetic characteristics of a random
      population

     inbred animals which have essentially identical genes

     hybrid animals which are the offspring of two different inbred parents

     spontaneous mutant animals which contain a naturally occurring genetic
      mutation such as immune deficiency and

     transgenic animals which contain genetic material transferred from
      another source

    with over 130 research models we offer one of the largest selections of
small animal models and provide our customers with high volume and high quality
production our rats mice and other rodent species such as guinea pigs and
hamsters have been and continue to be some of the most extensively used research
models in the world largely as a result of our continuous commitment to
innovation and quality in the breeding process we provide our small animal
models to numerous customers around the world including all major
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as hospitals and academic
institutions

    the use of animal models is critical to both the discovery and development
of a new drug the fda requires safe and effective testing on two species of
animal models one small and one large before moving into the clinic for
testing on humans animal testing is used in order to identify define
characterize and assess the safety of new drug candidates increasingly
genetically defined rats and mice are the model of choice in early discovery and
development work as a more specifically targeted research tool outbred rats are
frequently used in safety assessment studies our models are also used in life
science research within universities hospitals and other research institutions
unlike drug discovery these uses are generally not specifically mandated by
regulatory agencies such as the fda but instead are governed by the terms of
government grants institutional protocols as well as the scientific inquiry and
peer review publication processes we also provide larger animal models
including miniature swine and primates to the research community principally
for use in drug development and testing studies

    we believe that over the next several years many new research models will
be developed and used in biomedical research such as transgenic models cloned
models with identical genes knockout models with one or more disabled genes
and models that incorporate or exclude a particular mouse rat or human gene
these more highly defined and characterized models will allow researchers to
further focus their investigations into disease conditions and potential new
therapies or interventions we intend to build upon our position as the leader
in transgenic services to expand our presence in this market for higher value
models through internal development licensing partnerships and alliances and
acquisitions

    discovery services

    discovery represents the earliest stages of research and development in the
life sciences directed to the identification and selection of a lead compound
for future drug development discovery is followed by development activities
which are directed at validation of the selected drug candidates discovery and
development represent most of the preclinical activities in drug development

    initiated in 1995 the discovery services area of our business addresses the
growing need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the
noncore aspects of their drugdiscovery activities these discovery services
capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research
model business we currently offer four major categories of discovery services
transgenic services research support services infectious disease and genetic
testing and contract site management

    transgenic services  in this rapidly growing area of our business we
assist our customers in validating maintaining improving breeding and testing
models purchased or created by them for biomedical research activities while
the creation of a transgenic knockout or cloned model can be a critical
scientific event it is only the first step in the discovery process productive
utilization of research models requires significant additional technical
expertise we provide transgenic breeding expertise model characterization and
colony development genetic characterization quarantine embryo
cryopreservation embryo transfer rederivation and health and genetic
monitoring we provide these services to more than 150 laboratories around the
world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and
universities we maintain nearly 500 different types of research models for our
customers we expect that the demand for our services will grow as the use of
transgenic knockout and cloned animal models continues to grow within the
research community

    research support services  our research support services provide advanced
or specialized research model studies for our customers these projects
capitalize on our strong research model capabilities and also exploit more
recently developed capabilities in protocol development animal microsurgery
dosing techniques drug effectiveness testing and data management and analysis
we believe these services particularly in oncology and cardiovascular studies
offer added value to our research customers who rely on our extensive
expertise infrastructure and resources we also manage under contract a
genetically defined biosecure herd of miniature swine to provide organs for
human transplantation research known as xenotransplantation

    infectious disease and genetic testing  we assist our customers in
monitoring and analyzing the health and genetics of the research models used in
their research protocols we developed this capability internally by building
upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic laboratory needs of our
research model business depending upon a customers needs we may serve as its
sole source testing laboratory or as an alternative source supporting its
internal laboratory capabilities we believe that the continued growth in
development and utilization of transgenic knockout and cloned

                                       6
page
models will drive our future growth as the reference laboratory of choice for
genetic testing of special models

    contract site management  building upon our core capabilities as a leading
provider of high quality research models we manage animal care operations on
behalf of government academic pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations
increasing demand for our services reflects the growing necessity of these large
institutions to outsource internal functions or activities that are not critical
to the core scientific innovation and discovery process in addition we believe
that our expertise in managing the laboratory animal environment enhances the
productivity and quality of our customers research facilities this area leads
to additional opportunities for us to provide other products and services to our
customers site management does not require us to make any incremental
investment thereby generating a particularly strong return

    development services

    our development services enable our customers to outsource their noncore
drug development activities to us these activities are typically required for
the identification of the lead compound in order to support the regulatory
filings necessary to obtain fda approval we currently offer development
services in three main areas drug safety assessment biotech safety testing and
medical device testing

    drug safety assessment  we offer drug safety assessment services to
pharmaceutical medical device and biotechnology companies that are principally
focused on conducting regulatory compliance studies producing data to support
fda submissions these studies require highly specialized scientific
capabilities we have expertise in conducting critical developmental studies on
new drug candidates and medical devices that use research models including
long and shortterm evaluations of potential new treatments for human or animal
disease conditions we have unique expertise in several areas of safety
assessment and are continuously evaluating and selecting new services areas to
add to our portfolio we focus on highend niches of this market where our
scientific capabilities are strongly valued by our customers

    biotech safety testing  we provide specialized nonclinical quality control
testing that is frequently outsourced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies these services allow our customers to determine if the human protein
drug candidates or the process for manufacturing those products are
essentially free of residual biological materials the bulk of this testing work
is required by the fda for obtaining new drug approval maintaining an
fdalicensed manufacturing capability or releasing approved products for use on
patients our scientific staff consults with customers in the areas of process
development validation manufacturing scaleup and biological testing as more
biotechnology drug candidates with stronger potential enter and exit the
development pipeline we expect to continue to experience strong demand for
these testing services

    medical device testing  the fda requires companies introducing medical
devices to test the biocompatibility of any new materials that have not
previously been approved for contact with human tissue we provide a wide
variety of medical device testing services from prototype feasibility testing to
longterm glp or good laboratory practices studies primarily in large
research models these services include cardiovascular surgery biomaterial
reactivity studies orthopedic studies and related laboratory services we
maintain stateoftheart surgical suites where our skilled professional staff
implement custom surgery protocols provided by our customers

    in vitro detection systems

    while we do not foresee significant replacement of animal models from the
use of in vitro techniques we believe that these techniques may offer a strong
refinement or complement to animal

                                       7
page
test systems after the extended period of scientific validation is successfully
completed we intend to pursue this area to the extent alternatives become
commercially viable

    endotoxin detection systems  we are a market leader in endotoxin testing
which is used to test quality control samples of injectable drugs and devices
their components and the processes under which they are manufactured for the
presence of endotoxins endotoxins are fever producing pathogens or compounds
that are highly toxic to humans when sufficient quantities are introduced into
the body quality control testing for endotoxin contamination by our customers
is an fda requirement for injectable drugs and devices and the manufacture of
the test kits and reagents is regulated by the fda as a medical device
endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab
known as limulus amebocyte lysate or lal the lal test is the first and only
major fdavalidated in vitro alternative to an animal model test for testing the
safety and efficiency of new drug candidates the process of extracting blood is
not harmful to the crabs which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean
environment we produce and distribute test kits reagents software
accessories instruments and associated services to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies for medical devices and other products worldwide we
have filed for a patent relating to our next generation of endotoxin testing
technology

    bioactivity software  in the life sciences we have an exclusive strategic
alliance with multicase inc under which we offer their unique database
software program this program allows researchers to evaluate the potential
toxicity and pharmacological activity of new chemical compounds this program
uses a proprietary artificial intelligence capability and nearly twenty years of
data collected from public sources including the fda this in silico or
software alternative to the use of research animals is in the early stages of
commercialization we expect that bioactivity software that allows researchers
to more accurately predict defined outcomes for potential new drug candidates
will complement rather than replace the use of research models we plan to
evaluate adding other software tools through licensing and partnerships that
allow researchers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery
and development

    vaccine support products

    animal health  we are the global leader for the supply of specific
pathogenfree or spf chickens and fertile chicken eggs spf chicken embryos
are used by animal health companies as selfcontained bioreactors for the
manufacturing of live and killed viruses these viruses are used as a raw
material in poultry and potential human vaccine applications the production of
spf eggs is done under biosecure conditions similar to our research model
production we have a worldwide presence that includes several spf egg
production facilities in the united states as well as facilities in germany and
in australia we have a joint venture in mexico and a franchise in india we
also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the united states which provides
inhouse testing and support services to our customers

    human health  we are also applying our spf egg technology to human vaccine
markets we have entered into an agreement with a company that is in the late
stages of the fda approval process for a nasal spraydelivered vaccine for human
flu if fdaapproved and commercially successful this human flu vaccine may
significantly increase demand for our spf eggs

customers

    our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical companies including
the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies based on 2000 revenues as well as
biotechnology animal health medical device and diagnostic companies and
hospitals academic institutions and government agencies we have many
longterm stable relationships with our customers as evidenced by the fact that
all of our top 20 customers in 1990 remain our customers today

                                       8

    during 2000 in both our research models and our biomedical products and
services businesses approximately twothirds of our sales were to
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the balance were to hospitals
universities and the government our top 20 global customers represent only
about 30 of our 2000 net sales with no individual customer accounting for more
than 3 of net sales

sales marketing and customer support

    we sell our products and services principally through our direct sales
force as of december 30 2000 we had approximately 75 employees engaged in
field sales of which 34 were in the united states 12 were in europe and nine
were with charles river japan the direct sales force is supplemented by a
network of international distributors for some areas of our biomedical products
and services business

    our internal marketing groups support the field sales staff while developing
and implementing programs to create close working relationships with customers
in the biomedical research industry our web site wwwcrivercom is an
effective marketing tool and has become recognized as a valuable resource in
the laboratory animal field by a broad spectrum of industry leaders recording
over 500000 hits each month our website is not incorporated by reference in
this annual report on form 10k

    we maintain both customer service and technical assistance departments
which service our customers routine and more specialized needs we frequently
assist our customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry health and
genetics biosecurity protocol development and other areas in which our
expertise is recognized as a valuable customer resource

research and development

    we do not maintain a fully dedicated research and development staff rather
this work is done on an individual project basis or through collaborations with
universities or other institutions our dedicated research and development
spending was 14 million in 1998 05 million in 1999 and 09 million in
2000 our approach to developing new products or services is to extend our base
technologies into new applications and fields and to license or acquire
technologies to serve as a platform for the development of new businesses that
service our existing customer base our research and development focus is
principally on developing projects that improve our productivity or processes

industry support and animal welfare

    among the shared values of our employees is a concern for and commitment to
animal welfare we have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in
our industry and continue to demonstrate our commitment with special
recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment
in this critical area of our business

    we support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to
further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research
community we fund internships in laboratory animal medicine provide financial
support to nonprofit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of
animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the
laboratory animal medicine field one of our businesses dedicates a portion of
its net sales through a royalty to support similar programs and initiatives

employees

    as of december 30 2000 we had approximately 3500 employees including
over 100 science professionals with advanced degrees including dvms phds
and mds our employees are not unionized in the united states though we are
unionized in some european locales consistent with local custom for our
industry we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

competition

    our strategy is to be the leader in each of the markets in which we
participate our competitors are generally different in each of our business and
geographic areas

    in our research models business division our main competitors include three
smaller competitors in north america several smaller ones in europe and two
smaller ones in japan of our main united states competitors two are privately
held businesses and the third is a governmentfinanced nonprofit institution
we believe that none of our competitors for research models has our comparable
global reach financial strength breadth of product and services offerings and
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships

    we have many competitors in our biomedical products and services business
division a few of our competitors in our biomedical products and services
business are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or other
resources than we do however many are smaller and more regionalized we have a
small relative share in the biotech safety testing market where the market
leader is a wellestablished company and in medical device testing where there
are many larger competitors

    we generally compete on the basis of quality reputation and availability
which is supported by our international presence with strategically located
facilities

regulatory matters

    the animal welfare act governs the treatment of particular species intended
for use in research the awa imposes a wide variety of specific regulations on
producers and users of these species most notably cage size shipping
conditions and environmental enrichment methods we comply with licensing and
registration requirement standards set by the usda for handling regulated
species including breeding maintenance and transportation however rats mice
and chickens are not currently regulated under the awa as a result most of our
united states small animal research model activities and our vaccine support
services operations are not subject to regulation under the awa the united
states department of agriculture or usda has agreed as part of a settlement
of litigation to propose a change to the regulations issued under the animal
welfare act to include rats mice and birds including chickens congress
however has suspended the usdas rulemaking authority in this area our animal
production facilities in the united states are accredited by a highly regarded
member association known as aaalac which maintains standards that often exceed
those of the usda

    our biomedical products and services business is also generally regulated by
the usda and in the case of our endotoxin detection systems the fda our
manufacture of test kits and reagents for endotoxin testing is subject to
regulation by the fda under the authority of the federal food drug and
cosmetic act we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer
and are subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the fdas
quality system regulations and good manufacturing practices these regulations
require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a
prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing testing and control activities
in 1999 we received a warning letter from the fda for quality control
deficiencies with regard to our charleston south carolina facility we have
since taken corrective action satisfactory to the fda with respect to these
deficiencies

carefully because they discuss our future expectations contain projections of
our future results of operations or of our financial condition or state other
forwardlooking information we believe that it is important to communicate
our future expectations to our investors however there may be events in the
future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause
our actual results to differ materially from those discussed as a result of
various factors including contaminations at our facilities changes in the
pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries competition and changes in
government regulations or general economic or market conditions these factors
should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on
our forwardlooking statements you should be aware that the occurrence of the
events described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations and business sections and elsewhere in this annual
report could harm our business operating results and financial condition all
forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements and risk
factors discussed below contained throughout this annual report we are under no
duty to update any of the forwardlooking statements after the date of this
annual report or to conform these statements to actual results

industry and market data

    in this annual report on form 10k we rely on and refer to information and
statistics regarding the research model and biomedical products and services
industries and our market share in the sectors in which we compete we obtained
this information and statistics from various third party sources discussions
with our customers andor our own internal estimates we believe that these
sources and estimates are reliable but we have not independently verified them

risks related to our business and industry

if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and
  technologies we acquire our business may suffer

    we have recently expanded our business through the pai and primedica
acquisitions and we plan to continue to grow our business through acquisitions
of businesses and technologies and the formation of alliances however
businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find
acceptable even if completed acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks
which may include

     difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating operations services
      products or technologies

     difficulties in developing and operating new businesses including
      diversion of managements attention from other business concerns

     the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and
      difficulties in attracting new employees to grow businesses

     difficulties in assimilating differences in foreign business practices and
      overcoming language barriers

     difficulties in obtaining intellectual property protections and skills
      that we and our employees currently do not have and

     difficulties in achieving business and financial success

    in the event that the success of an acquired business or technology or an
alliance does not meet expectations we may be required to restructure we may
not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business or
successfully exploit new business or technologies

contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our
  reputation for contaminantfree production and result in decreased sales

    our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of contaminants
such as viruses and bacteria the presence of contaminants can distort or
compromise the quality of research results contaminations in our isolated
breeding rooms or poultry houses could disrupt our contaminantfree research
model and fertile egg production harm our reputation for contaminantfree
production and result in decreased sales

    contaminations typically require cleaning up the contaminated room or
poultry house this cleanup results in inventory loss cleanup and startup
costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for
prior shipments these contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to
predict we experienced several material contaminations in our animal
populations in 1996 and a few significant contaminations in 1997 that adversely
impacted our 1996 and 1997 financial results since then we have made over
8 million in capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and
have significantly changed our operating procedures we have not experienced any
significant contaminations since 1997

many of our customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we are
  subject to risks uncertainties and trends that affect companies in those
  industries

    sales of our products and services are highly dependent on research and
development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we are
therefore subject to risks uncertainties and trends that affect companies in
those industries including government regulation pricing pressure
technological change and shifts in the focus and scope of research and
development expenditures for example over the past several years the
pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant mergers and combinations and
many industry experts expect this trend to continue after recent mergers and
combinations some customers combined or otherwise reduced their research and
development operations resulting in fewer animal research activities we
experienced both temporary disruptions and permanent reductions in sales of our
research models to some of these customers future mergers and combinations in
the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries or other industrywide trends
could adversely affect demand for or pricing of our products

new technologies may be developed validated and increasingly used in biomedical
  research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services

    for many years groups within the scientific and research community have
attempted to develop models methods and systems that would replace or
supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research
companies have developed several techniques that have scientific merit
especially in the area of cosmetics and household product testing markets in
which we are not active only a few alternative test methods in the discovery
and development of effective and safe treatments for human and animal disease
conditions have been validated and successfully deployed the principal
validated nonanimal test system is the lal or endotoxin detection system a
technology which we acquired and have aggressively marketed as an alternative to
testing in animals it is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any
nonanimal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative
or adjunct in our markets however these methods may not be available to us or
we may not be successful in commercializing these methods even if we are
successful sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or
profits from research models

    alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models
and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner
to replace any lost sales in addition one of the anticipated outcomes of
genomics research is to permit the elimination of more compounds

                                       12

prior to preclinical testing while this outcome may not occur for several
years if at all it may reduce the demand for some of our products and
services

the outsourcing trend in the preclinical and nonclinical stages of drug
  discovery and development meaning contracting out to others functions that
  were previously performed internally may decrease which could slow our
  growth

    some areas of our biomedical products and services business have grown
significantly as a result of the increase over the past several years in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and
nonclinical research support activities while industry analysts expect the
outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years a substantial decrease
in preclinical and nonclinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished
growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected highergrowth areas

our business may be affected by changes in the animal welfare act and related
  regulations which may require us to alter our operations

    the animal welfare act imposes a wide variety of specific regulations on
producers and users of regulated species including cage size shipping
conditions and environmental enrichment methods depending on whether the final
rulemaking in this area includes rats mice and birds including chickens we
could be required to alter our production operations this may include adding
production capacity new equipment and additional employees we believe that
application of the animal welfare act to rats mice and chickens used in our
research model and vaccine support products operations in the united states will
not result in loss of net sales margin or market share since all us
producers and users will be subject to the same regulations while we do not
anticipate that the addition of rats mice and chickens to the animal welfare
act would require significant expenditures changes to the regulations may be
more stringent than we expect and require more significant expenditures
additionally if we fail to comply with state regulations including general
anticruelty legislation foreign laws and other anticruelty laws we could
face significant civil and criminal penalties

factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and increased international and us
  regulatory requirements may increase our costs of doing business in foreign
  countries

    a significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the
united states our operations and financial results could be significantly
affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates uncertainties
related to regional economic circumstances and the costs of complying with a
wide variety of international and us regulatory requirements

    because the sales and expenses of our foreign operations are generally
denominated in local currencies we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations
between local currencies and the us dollar in the reported results of our
foreign operations these fluctuations may decrease our earnings we currently
do not hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations

we face significant competition in our business and if we are unable to respond
  to competition in our business our revenues may decrease

    we face significant competition from different competitors in each of our
business areas some of our competitors in biotech safety testing and medical
device testing are larger than we are and may have greater capital technical or
other resources than we do we generally compete on the basis of quality
reputation and availability of service expansion by our competitors into other
areas in which we operate new entrants into our markets or changes in our
competitors strategy could adversely affect our competitive position any
erosion of our competitive position may decrease our revenues or limit our
growth

                                       13

negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business

    our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have
not historically been the subject of animal rights media attention however the
large animal component of our business has been the subject of adverse attention
and onsite protests we closed our small import facility in england due in part
to protests by animal right activists which included threats against our
facilities and employees future negative attention or threats against our
facilities or employees could impair our business

one of our large animal operations is dependent on a single source of supply
  which if interrupted could adversely affect our business

    we depend on a single international source of supply for one of our large
animal operations disruptions to their continued supply may arise from export
or import restrictions or embargoes foreign government or economic instability
or severe weather conditions any disruption of supply could harm our business
if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or
secondary source on comparable commercial terms

tax benefits we expect to be available in the future may be subject to
  challenge

    in connection with the recapitalization our shareholders crl acquisition
llc and bausch  lomb incorporated or bl made a joint election intended to
permit us to increase the depreciable and amortizable tax basis in our assets
for federal income tax purposes thereby providing us with expected future tax
benefits in connection with our initial public offering crl acquisition llc
reorganized terminated its existence as a corporation for tax purposes and
distributed a substantial portion of our stock to its members it is possible
that the internal revenue service may contend that this reorganization and
liquidating distribution should be integrated with our original
recapitalization we believe that the reorganization and liquidating
distribution should not have any impact upon the election for federal income tax
purposes however the internal revenue service may reach a different
conclusion if the internal revenue service were successful the expected future
tax benefits would not be available and we would be required to write off the
related deferred tax asset reflected in our balance sheet by recording a
nonrecurring tax expense in our results of operations in an amount equal to
such deferred tax asset see item 7managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or
  recruit additional qualified personnel which would harm our business

    our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our
senior management and other members of management james c foster our chief
executive officer since 1992 has held various positions with charles river for
25 years and became our chairman last year we have no employment agreement with
mr foster nor with any other executive officer if mr foster or other members
of management do not continue in their present positions our business may
suffer

    because of the specialized scientific nature of our business we are highly
dependent upon qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel there
is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnological fields therefore we may not be able to attract and retain the
qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of
the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional
key scientific technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner could harm
our business

dlj merchant banking partners ii lp and its affiliates have substantial
  control over our company and may have different interests than those of other
  holders of our common stock

    dlj merchant banking partners ii lp and affiliated funds which we refer
to as the dljmb funds beneficially own approximately 300 of our outstanding
common stock as a result of their stock ownership and contractual rights they
received in the recapitalization these entities have substantial control over
our business policies and affairs including the power to

     elect a majority of our directors

     appoint new management

     prevent or cause a change of control and

     substantially control any action requiring the approval of the holders of
      common stock including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of
      incorporation and approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our
      assets

    the directors elected by the dljmb funds have the ability to control
decisions affecting the business and management of our company including our
capital structure this includes the issuance of additional capital stock the
implementation of stock repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends
the dljmb funds and the directors they appoint may have different interests than
those of other holders of our common stock

our historical financial information may not be representative of our results as
  a separate company

    the historical financial information in this annual report on form 10k for
the periods prior to the recapitalization may not reflect what our results of
operations financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a
separate standalone company during the periods presented or in the future we
made some adjustments and allocations to the historical financial statements in
this annual report on form 10k because bl did not account for us as a single
standalone business for all periods presented our adjustments and allocations
made in preparing our historical consolidated financial statements may not
appropriately reflect our operations during the periods presented as if we had
operated as a standalone company

healthcare reform could reduce or eliminate our business opportunities

    the united states and many foreign governments have reviewed or undertaken
healthcare reform most notably price controls on new drugs which may adversely
affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies resulting in a decrease of the business opportunities available to
us we cannot predict the impact that any pending or future healthcare reform
proposals may have on our business

item 3 legal proceedings

    our operations and properties are subject to extensive foreign and federal
state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and
regulations these laws and regulations govern among other things the
generation storage handling use and transportation of hazardous materials and
the handling and disposal of hazardous and biohazardous waste generated at our
facilities under such laws and regulations we are required to obtain permits
from governmental authorities for some of our operations if we violate or fail
to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators under some environmental laws and
regulations we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to
any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste
disposal sites as a result of disputes with federal state and local
authorities and private environmental groups regarding damage to mangrove plants
on two islands in the florida keys we agreed to refoliate the islands at our
cost although we have not been able to completely replant principally due to
the presence of a freerange animal population and storms we believe that the
cost of refoliation will not have a material adverse effect on our business

    although we believe that our costs of complying with current and future
environmental laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of
or exposure to hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our
business results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you
that they will not do so

indebtedness we are a holding company and are dependent on distributions from
our subsidiaries to meet our cash requirements the terms of the indenture
governing our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility restrict the
ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us and consequently
restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
  of operations

    the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements filed february 14 2001

overview

    we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support
services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development we
are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in
research and development for new drugs devices and therapies and have been in
this business for more than 50 years

    we operate in two segments for financial reporting purposes research models
and biomedical products and services in addition since services represent over
10 of our net sales our consolidated financial statements also provide a
breakdown of net sales between net sales related to products which include both
research models and biomedical products and net sales related to services
which reflect biomedical services and a breakdown of costs between costs of
products sold and costs of services provided the following tables show the net
sales and the percentage contribution of our segments research models and
biomedical products and services for the past three years they also show costs
of products sold and services provided selling general and administrative
expenses and operating income for both research models and biomedical products
and services by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net
sales

    net sales  we recognize revenue with respect to research model sales upon
transfer of title which is when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer we recognize revenues with respect to services as these services are
performed over the past three years unit volume of small animal research
models has increased modestly in north america and has decreased modestly in
europe during the same period sales in both north america and europe have
increased principally as a result of price increases and a shift in mix towards
higher priced research models in recent years we have increased our focus on
the sale of specialty research models such as special disease models which
have contributed to additional sales growth

    our customers typically place orders for research models with less than a
weeks lead time meeting such demand requires efficient inventory management
and strong customer service support we improved inventory availability in the
last three years through better forecasting and production mix and most
importantly improved biosecurity thereby reducing contaminations

    biomedical products and services have grown at a compounded rate of 363
from 1998 to 2000 our growth in this business demonstrated our ability to
capitalize on our core research model technology and enter into related product
development activities undertaken by our customers

    pricing  we maintain published list prices for all of our research models
biomedical products and some of our services we also have pricing agreements
with our customers which provide some discounts usually based on volume many
of our services are based on customized orders and are priced accordingly while
pricing has been competitive some of our products are priced at a premium due
to the higher quality better availability and superior customer support that
our customers associate with our products

    biosecurity  biosecurity is one of our highest operational priorities
prior breaches of biosecurity have adversely affected our results of operations
and we cannot assure you that future breaches would not materially affect our
results of operations a biosecurity breach typically results in additional
expenses from the need to clean up the contaminated room which in turn results
in inventory loss cleanup and startup costs and can reduce net sales as a
result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments we experienced a
few significant contaminations in 1997 in our isolation rooms for research
models and in our poultry houses for vaccine support products since january 1
1997 we have made over 8 million of capital expenditures designed to
strengthen our biosecurity primarily by upgrading our production facilities in
addition we have made significant changes to our operating procedures for
isolation rooms and poultry houses designed to further minimize the risks of

                                       20
page
contamination including for example increasing the frequency of replacing
masks and gowns and most importantly increasing awareness and training among
our employees these improvements to our operating procedures increased annual
ongoing biosecurityrelated expenses by approximately 05 million in 1999
while we cannot assure you that we will not experience future significant
isolation room or poultry house contaminations in the future we believe these
changes have contributed to our absence of significant contaminations during
1998 1999 and 2000

    acquisitions  since january 1 1998 we have successfully acquired and
integrated four companies which contributed 474 million in sales in 2000
representing 155 of total sales on september 29 1999 we acquired sierra for
an initial total purchase price of 233 million including approximately
173 million in cash paid to former shareholders and assumed debt of
approximately 60 million which we immediately retired in addition we are
obligated to pay 20 million in additional purchase price due to specified
financial objectives being reached by december 30 2000 the additional
consideration was recorded as additional goodwill in the year ended
december 30 2000 we have also agreed to pay a up to 100 million in
performancebased bonus payments if specified financial objectives are reached
in the five years following the acquisition date with no payment in any
individual year to exceed 27 million and b 30 million in retention and
noncompetition payments contingent upon the continuing employment of specified
key scientific and managerial personnel through june 30 2001 sierra became
part of our drug safety assessment area

    the 100 million in performancebased bonus payments will if paid be
expensed during the periods in which it becomes reasonably certain that the
financial objectives will be achieved approximately 14 million of
performancebased bonus payments were made on december 31 2000 and were
recorded as compensation expense in the year ended december 30 2000 we
expensed 14 million in fiscal 1999 and 10 million in fiscal 2000 of the
30 million in retention and noncompetition payments the 06 million
remaining will be expensed ratably through june 2001

    effective january 8 2001 we purchased 100 of the common stock of pai we
paid consideration of 37 million with respect to this acquisition consisting
of 25 million in cash and a 12 million callable convertible note

    on february 27 2001 we acquired primedica for consideration of
approximately 52 million the consideration is comprised of 26 million in
cash 165 million in restricted stock which we may repurchase through
july 1 2001 and 95 million in assumed debt

    joint ventures  at december 25 1999 we had two unconsolidated joint
ventures as of february 28 2000 we acquired an additional 16 equity interest
in one of the joint ventures charles river japan increasing our ownership
interest to 66 the purchase price for the 16 equity interest was 14 billion
yen or 128 million of which 400 million yen or 37 million was paid by a
threeyear balloon promissory note secured by a pledge of the purchased
interest the note bears interest at the longterm prime rate in japan charles
river japan is engaged principally in the research model business our royalty
agreement provides us with 3 of the sales of locally produced research models
and having acquired majority ownership we have consolidated its operations for
financial reporting purposes from the effective date of the acquisition in the
first quarter of fiscal 2000 this contributed 366 million in sales in 2000
we also receive dividends based on our prorata share of net income charles
river japan paid dividends prior to the additional equity investment amounted to
07 million 08 million and 00 million in 1998 1999 and 2000
respectively our other unconsolidated joint venture is charles river mexico an
extension of our vaccine support products area which is not significant to our
business

    allocation of costs from bausch  lomb  historically bl charged us for
some direct expenses including insurance information technology and other
miscellaneous expenses based upon actual charges incurred on our behalf
however these charges and estimates are not necessarily indicative of

                                       21
page
the costs and expenses which would have resulted had we incurred these costs as
a standalone entity the actual amounts of expenses we incur in future periods
may vary significantly from these allocations and estimates

    the recapitalization and sierra acquisition  the recapitalization which
was consummated on september 29 1999 was accounted for as a leveraged
recapitalization and had no impact on the historical basis of our assets and
liabilities the sierra acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting with the purchase price allocated to the assets and liabilities of
sierra based on an estimate of their fair value with the remainder allocated to
goodwill we incurred various costs of approximately 226 million pretax in
connection with consummating the recapitalization we have capitalized and are
amortizing the portion of these costs that represents deferred financing costs
approximately 144 million over the life of the related financing we have
charged a portion of the expenses related to the recapitalization approximately
82 million to retained earnings

    deferred tax assets  in conjunction with the recapitalization crl
acquisition llc and bl made a joint election under section 338h10 of the
internal revenue code of 1986 as amended such election resulted in a stepup
in the tax basis of the underlying assets and a net deferred tax asset of
995 million was recorded in the consolidated financial statements the tax
purchase price allocation related to the election was not finalized until the
second quarter of 2000 and an adjustment of 45 million was recorded in that
quarter to reduce the net deferred tax asset balance and capital in excess of
par in accordance with the final allocation in addition we have used the
proceeds from our initial public offering to repay a portion of our outstanding
debt and expect to be more profitable in the future due to reduced interest
costs we therefore reassessed the need for a valuation allowance associated
with the deferred asset balance discussed above and reduced this valuation
allowance by 48 million this reduction in valuation allowance was recorded as
a tax benefit in the second quarter of 2000 the net deferred tax asset
pertaining to the election under section 338h10 of the internal revenue code
as of december 30 2000 of approximately 923 million is expected to be
realized over 15 years through future tax deductions which are expected to
reduce future tax payments it is possible that the internal revenue service may
challenge the availability of the section 338h10 election if the internal
revenue service were successful the expected future tax benefits from the
election would not be available and we would be required to write off the
related deferred tax assets by recording a nonrecurring expense in our results
of operations in an amount equal to such deferred tax assets see note 9 to
the consolidated financial statements we believe that the reorganization and
liquidating distribution should not have any impact upon the election for
federal income tax purposes however the internal revenue service may reach a
different conclusion see item 1business tax benefits we expect to be
available in the future may be subject to challenge

    initial public offering  the net proceeds of our initial public offering
were used to repay approximately 2047 million in outstanding indebtedness
including issuance discounts in the third quarter of 2000 in connection with
this repayment we also have paid premiums and written off deferred financing
costs we recorded an extraordinary loss of 291 million net of tax benefits
of 157 million in the third quarter of 2000

fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

    net sales  net sales in 2000 were 3066 million an increase of
752 million or 325 from 2314 million in 1999 results for 2000 and 1999
on a pro forma basis for the strategic transactions which include the
acquisition of sierra in september 1999 and the acquisition of control of our
japanese joint venture in february 2000 reflect a 10 increase for the year
124 excluding the impact of foreign currencies

    research models  net sales of research models in 2000 were 1877 million
an increase of 352 million or 231 from 1525 million in 1999 small
animal research model sales increased in north america by 123 due to continued
improved pricing a shift to higher priced specialty units and an increase in
unit volume excluding negative currency translation of 76 million and the
reduction in lab equipment sales of 18 million which tends to be variable
european small animal research model sales increased by 32 small animal
research model sales in japan which we began consolidating during the first
quarter of 2000 were 362 million in 2000 we also experienced an increase
during 2000 in our large animal import and conditioning business of 52 our
large animal breeding colony in florida which was sold in the first quarter of
2000 accounted for 28 million of sales in 1999

    biomedical products and services  net sales of biomedical products and
services in 2000 were 1189 million an increase of 400 million or 507
from 789 million in 1999 sierra contributed 268 million of sales growth in
2000 due to the full year impact of its acquisition the remaining product lines
increased 183 in total in 2000 primarily due to increased outsourcing by our
customers

    cost of products sold and services provided  cost of products sold and
services provided in 2000 was 1867 million an increase of 400 million or
273 from 1467 million in 1999 cost of products sold and services provided
in 2000 was 609 of net sales compared to 634 of net sales in 1999

    research models  cost of products sold and services provided for research
models in 2000 was 1133 million an increase of 168 million or 174
compared to 965 million in 1999 cost of products sold and services provided
in 2000 was 604 of net sales compared to 633 of net sales in 1999 cost of
products sold and services provided increased at a lower rate than net sales due
to increased sales volume resulting in improved capacity utilization

    biomedical products and services  cost of products sold and services
provided for biomedical products and services in 2000 was 734 million an
increase of 232 million or 462 compared to 502 million in 1999 cost of
products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales in 2000 was
617 an improvement from 636 in 1999 the favorable cost of products sold
and services provided as a percent of net sales in 2000 is attributable to our
increased sales and improved sierra profitability

    selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and
administrative expenses in 2000 were 512 million an increase of
114 million or 286 from 398 million in 1999 selling general and
administrative expenses for 2000 were 167 of net sales compared to 172 of
net sales in 1999

    research models  selling general and administrative expenses for research
models in 2000 were 309 million an increase of 87 million or 392
compared to 222 million in 1999 the 87 million increase is mainly due to
consolidation of charles river japan in the first quarter of 2000 along with a
13 million restructuring charge for a plant closing and personnel reductions
in one of our small animal research models locations in france selling general
and administrative expenses for 2000 were 165 of net sales compared to 146
for 1999

    biomedical products and services  selling general and administrative
expenses for biomedical products and services in 2000 were 182 million an
increase of 57 million or 456 compared to 125 million in 1999 the
acquisition of sierra in the fourth quarter of 1999 accounts for 29 million of
the increase selling general and administrative expenses in 2000 decreased to
153 of net sales compared to 158 of net sales in 1999 due to greater
economies of scale realized though our acquisition of sierra and increased
sales

    unallocated corporate overhead  unallocated corporate overhead which
consists of various corporate expenses was 21 million in 2000 compared to
51 million in 1999 unallocated corporate overhead has decreased mainly due to
pension income from favorable investment returns

    amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  amortization of goodwill
and other intangibles in 2000 was 37 million an increase of 17 million from
20 million in 1999 the increase was due mainly to the full year effect of the
amortization of intangibles from our sierra acquisition

    operating income  operating income in 2000 was 651 million an increase
of 221 million or 514 from 430 million in 1999 operating income in 2000

increased in total and as a percentage of net sales due to our sales growth
acquisition of sierra and improved capacity utilization

    research models  operating income from sales of research models in 2000 was
431 million an increase of 94 million or 279 from 337 million in
1999 operating income from sales of research models in 2000 was 230 of net
sales compared to 221 in 1999 the increased operating income was
attributable to the growth in sales coupled with improved capacity utilization

    biomedical products and services  operating income from sales of biomedical
products and services in 2000 was 241 million an increase of 97 million or
674 from 144 million in 1999 operating income from sales of biomedical
products and services in 2000 increased to 203 of net sales compared to 183
of net sales in 1999 the increase is attributable to our acquisition of sierra
as well as our increased sales

    interest expense  interest expense in 2000 was 407 million compared to
128 million in 1999 the 279 million increase from 1999 was primarily due to
the additional debt incurred as a result of the recapitalization which occurred
on september 29 1999 partially offset by the debt repayment in the third
quarter

    income taxes  the effective tax rate in 2000 excluding the reversal of the
deferred tax valuation allowance of 48 million was 483 as compared to 507
in 1999 the impact of leverage in the first half of the year had an unfavorable
impact on our tax rate by lowering our pretax income and increasing the impact
of the permanent timing differences on the tax rate the effective tax rate did
improve in the last six months the 48 million reversal of the valuation
allowance associated with the deferred tax asset was recorded as a tax benefit
in the second quarter of 2000 due to a reassessment of the need for a valuation
allowance following our initial public offering

    income before the extraordinary loss  income before the extraordinary loss
in 2000 was 179 million an increase of 08 million from 171 million in
1999 the increase is driven by the increase in operating income and the
reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance which is partially offset by
the full year impact of interest expense

    extraordinary loss  we recorded an extraordinary loss of 291 million
during the third quarter of 2000 the pretax loss of 448 million is the
result of premiums related to the early repayment of debt and the write off of
deferred financing costs and issuance discounts associated with the debt
repayments and is recorded net of tax benefits of 157 million

    net income loss  the loss in 2000 was 112 million a decrease of
283 million from net income of 171 million in 1999 the increased income
from operations and the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance was
offset by the extraordinary loss associated with the debt repayment and the full
year impact of interest expense

fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998

    net sales  net sales in 1999 were 2314 million an increase of
263 million or 128 from 2051 million in 1998

    research models  net sales of research models in 1999 were 1525 million
an increase of 76 million or 52 from 1449 million in 1998 sales
increased due to the increase in small animal research model sales in north
america and europe of 71 million resulting from improved pricing a more
favorable product mix meaning a shift to higher priced units and an increase
in unit volume we also experienced an increase in the large animal import and
conditioning area of 06 million mainly due to pricing

    biomedical products and services  net sales of biomedical products and
services in 1999 were 789 million an increase of 187 million or 311
from 602 million in 1998 at the beginning of the second quarter of 1998 we
made two acquisitions that contributed 34 million of this sales growth and on
september 29 1999 we acquired sierra which had sales of 59 million in the
fourth quarter the remaining increase was due to significant sales increases of
transgenic and research support services of 29 million and endotoxin detection
systems of 22 million and sales from our contract site management services of
18 million primarily due to better customer awareness of our outsourcing
solutions

    cost of products sold and services provided  cost of products sold and
services provided in 1999 was 1467 million an increase of 124 million or
92 from 1343 million in 1998

was 633 of net sales compared to 663 of net sales in 1998 cost of products
sold and services provided increased at a lower rate than net sales due to the
more favorable product mix and better pricing as well as improved capacity
utilization

sales in 1998 selling general and administrative expenses also included
research and development expense of 05 million in 1999 compared to
14 million in 1998

models in 1999 were 222 million an increase of 41 million or 227
compared to 181 million in 1998 selling general and administrative expenses
in 1999 were 146 of net sales compared to 125 in 1998 the increase was
attributable to additional worldwide marketing efforts additional salespeople
in the united states and the impact of selling efforts in europe for esd a
business acquired at the end of 1998

    biomedical products and services  selling general and administrative
expenses for biomedical products and services in 1999 were 125 million an
increase of 28 million or 289 compared to 97 million in 1998 selling
general and administrative expenses in 1999 decreased to 158 of net sales
compared to 161 of net sales in 1998 due to greater economies of scale

    unallocated corporate overhead  unallocated corporate overhead which
consists of various corporate expenses was 51 million in 1999 a decrease of
12 million or 190 compared to 63 million in 1998 the decrease was
principally from the increase in cash surrender value associated with our
supplemental executive retirement program

    amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  amortization of goodwill
and other intangibles in 1999 was 20 million an increase of 07 million or
538 from 13 million in 1998 the increase was due to the effect of
additional amortization of intangibles resulting from four recent acquisitions
two in april 1998 one in december 1998 and sierra in september 1999

    research models  operating income from sales of research models in 1999 was
337 million an increase of 32 million or 105 from 305 million in
1998 operating income from sales of research models in 1999 was 221 of net
sales compared to 210 in 1998 the increase was attributable to the factors
described above

    biomedical products and services  operating income from sales of biomedical
products and services in 1999 was 144 million an increase of 33 million or
297 from 111 million in 1998 operating income from sales of biomedical
products and services in 1999 decreased to 183 of net sales compared to 184
of net sales in 1998 this was primarily due to the acquisition of sierra and
the impact of additional amortization of intangibles

                                       26

    other income  we recorded a 14 million gain on the sale of two small
facilities one located in florida and the other located in the netherlands
and a charge of 13 million for stock compensation expense

    interest expense  interest expense for 1999 was 128 million compared to
04 million for 1998 the 124 million increase was primarily due to the
additional debt incurred in the recapitalization

    income taxes  the effective tax rate of 507 in 1999 as compared to 394
in 1998 reflects the remittance of cash dividends of 207 million from our
foreign subsidiaries which in turn were remitted to bl the related amounts
were previously considered permanently reinvested in the foreign jurisdictions
for us income tax reporting purposes therefore we were required to provide
additional taxes upon their repatriation to the united states in addition in
1999 an election was made by bl to treat some foreign entities as branches for
us income tax purposes as a result all previously untaxed accumulated
earnings of such entities became immediately subject to tax in the united
states the receipt of the cash dividends from the foreign subsidiaries and the
foreign tax elections made resulted in incremental united states taxes of
20 million net of foreign tax credits in 1999

    net income  net income in 1999 was 171 million a decrease of
63 million or 269 from 234 million in 1998 the decrease was
attributable to the increased interest expense

liquidity and capital resources

    historically our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow from
operations borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from our initial
public offering

    in september 1999 we received a 924 million equity investment from dljmb
and affiliated funds management and some other investors we issued
376 million senior discount debentures with warrants to purchase common stock
and 1500 million units consisting of senior subordinated notes due in 2009
with warrants to purchase common stock and borrowed 1620 million under our
senior secured credit facility we redeemed 875 of our outstanding capital
stock held by bl for 4000 million and a 430 million subordinated discount
note we simultaneously acquired sierra for an initial purchase price of
233 million including 173 million paid to its former stockholders and
60 million of assumed debt which we immediately retired

    borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per year equal
to a margin over either a base rate or libor the 300 million revolving loan
commitment will terminate six years after the date of the initial funding of the
credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to
250 million at our request which will only be available to us under some
circumstances under the same terms and conditions of the original
300 million revolving credit facility the term loan facility under the credit
facility consists of a 400 million term loan a facility and a 1200 million
term loan b facility the term loan a facility matures six years after the
closing date of the facility and the term loan b facility matures eight years
after the closing date of the facility in february 2001 in connection with
the anticipated primedica acquisition we amended our credit facility to add a
25 million term c loan facility and to increase the interest rate on the
term a loan facility to libor plus 175 from libor plus 15 as of
january 30 2001 the interest rate on the term a loan facility was 81375 the
interest rate on the term b loan facility was 103875 the interest rate on the
term c loan facility was 81375 and there was an aggregate of 1161 million
outstanding under our loan facilities the credit facility contains customary
covenants and events of default including substantial restrictions on our
subsidiarys ability to declare dividends or make distributions the term loans
are subject to mandatory prepayment with the proceeds of certain asset sales and
a portion of our excess cash flow

    in february 2000 the 135 senior subordinated notes were exchanged for
registered notes having the same financial terms and covenants as the notes
issued in september 1999 interest on the notes is

                                       27
page
payable semiannually in cash the notes contain customary covenants and events
of default including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt pay
dividends and make particular investments

    in the third quarter of 2000 we consummated an initial public offering of
16100000 shares of our common stock at a price of 1600 per share we used
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately 2360 million to redeem a
portion of the outstanding senior subordinated notes including associated
premiums and to repay our senior discount debentures subordinated discount note
and a portion of our bank debt

    on march 21 2001 we consummated a public offering of 3500000 shares of
our common stock at a price of 1900 per share in the offering 4550000
shares of common stock which included the exercise of the underwriters
overallotment option of 1050000 shares were also sold by existing
shareholders we received proceeds of approximately 625 million which we
intend to use to repay a portion of our indebtedness retire obligations
incurred in connection with recent acquisitions and for general corporate
purposes

    we anticipate that our operating cash flow together with borrowings under
our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating
expenses capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due
however charles river laboratories international inc is a holding company
with no operations or assets other than its ownership of 100 of the common
stock of its subsidiary charles river laboratories inc we have no source of
liquidity other than dividends from our subsidiary

existing debt including issuance discounts and 315 million to pay premiums
associated with the early repayment of the debt in 1999 we received a
924 million equity investment from dljmb and affiliated funds management and
some other investors we issued 376 million senior discount debentures which

paid off 639 million in 2000 in 1999 we redeemed 875 of our outstanding
capital stock held by bl for 4000 million and a 430 million subordinated
discount note which we repaid in 2000 net activity with bl our 100
shareholder up until the recapitalization in 1999 was 294 million in net
payments in 1999

    we anticipate that our operating cash flows together with borrowings under
our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating
expenses capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due

fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998

    cash flows from operating activities in 1999 were 376 million compared to
374 million in 1998 net cash used in investing activities in 1999 was

associated with the recapitalization we also paid a dividend of 294 million
to bl which was excess cash at the time of the recapitalization and the
recapitalization consideration was 4000 million the above was offset by the
proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 3390 million the issuance of
warrants of 106 million and the issuance of common stock of 924 million

recent accounting pronouncements

    in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as
either an asset or liability measured at its fair value this statement also
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met sfas 133 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after june 30 1999 however statement of
financial accounting standards no 137 deferral of the effective date of sfas
no 133 was issued to defer adoption of sfas no 133 to fiscal years beginning
after june 30 2000 based on the analysis prepared by the company to date the
adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the companys
results of operations or financial position



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

    we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates our primary interest rate exposure results from
changes in libor or the base rate which are used to determine the applicable
interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility we have
entered into an interest rate protection agreement designed to protect us
against fluctuations in interest rates with respect to at least 50 of the
aggregate principal amount of the term loans and the senior subordinated notes
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical
instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on
all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately 13 million
fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on the
senior subordinated notes which is fixed

    we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative
purposes

    we also have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
for the cash flows received from our foreign affiliates this risk is mitigated
by the fact that their operations are conducted in their respective local
currencies and it is not our intention to repatriate earnings prospectively
currently we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities as we do
not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate risk is material
