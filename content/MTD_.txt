beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations we also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistics processes 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 454 million in research and development 170 million in 2021 140 million in 2020 and 144 million in 2019 which is approximately 5 of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into three categories 

• technology advancements which generate new products or features and increase the value of our products these advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality new applications for our technologies more accurate or reliable measurement additional software capability or automation through robotics or other means 

• applications development to complement our products and provide complete solutions to our customers 

• cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design andor improve the ease of serviceability 

we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1500 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany the united kingdom and mexico we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically not longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on earnings before taxes than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total global workforce was 17800 consisting of 15600 employees and 2200 temporary personnel as of december 31 2021 and includes approximately 6200 in europe 5500 in north and south america and 6100 in asia and other countries 

we are proud of our corporate culture and our talented employees we endeavor to continue to provide an attractive work environment and keep our employees fully engaged we know that our future success depends on attracting developing and retaining the best employees we promote equal opportunity and inclusiveness worldwide and value diversity in our global workforce which reflects the diversity in the many communities in which we operate internationally we employ people of more than 100 nationalities 

we promote diversity and we encourage all employees inclusive of all our demographics to take on more responsibilities and management positions as of december 31 2021 approximately 36 of our global employee headcount was female with approximately 28 holding management positions we place great emphasis on performance management training and developing our employees across all levels and regions during 2021 approximately 13900 employees completed one or more training courses lastly we have local safety programs in place in all relevant units and select locations have implemented a certified work safety management system severe workplace accidents are rare and we have had no fatalities from occupational incidents in the past five years 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years approximately 7600 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent employee interests 

sustainability 

sustainability touches all aspects of our business from designing sourcing and producing our products to selling and delivering them to our customers to handling them at the end of their lifecycle a sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers employees suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate our business we want to manage our business sustainably to position the company for longterm growth more than 10 years ago we launched our greenmt program to pursue environmental social and governance priorities where we can have a significant impact we do this in five key areas 1 keeping our operations sustainable over the long term by ensuring we use resources efficiently 2 helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering sustainable products and services 3 promoting responsible practices within our supply chain 4 ensuring an engaged workforce through fair attractive safe and developmentminded workplaces and 5 following corporate governance best practices 

we have set a number of goals relating to our greenmt sustainability program including reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental social and governance goals as of 2020 we achieved carbon neutrality with respect to scope 1 and scope 2 co 2 emissions and source 100 renewable 

electricity we also broadened our goals relating to waste including reducing our waste intensity by 20 and achieving zero waste to landfill in each case by 2025 we are also committed to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 paris agreement on climate change our commitment includes nearterm longterm and netzero targets consistent with the latest criteria issued by the science based target initiative sbti we are working toward validating our targets with sbti and intend to share additional details on the specific targets as we progress through the validation process we report annually on our progress related to sustainability topics in our corporate responsibility report available on wwwmtcomsustainability 

blue ocean program 

blue ocean refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses an enterprise architecture with a global singleinstance erp system within our it systems we continue to move toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we are also largely standardizing our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period we have implemented the blue ocean program in our us china switzerland germany uk benelux spain japan and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have approximately 85 of our users on the program and we will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland china the european union germany the united kingdom italy france japan south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will be approximately a total of 04 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range application and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing 

customer service and support and operational excellence throughout our supply chain we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a risk factors 

factors affecting our future operating results 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect various aspects of our business such as our workforce and supply chain and make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and has adversely affected the global economy which in turn can adversely affect our global business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises that could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

for instance since late 2019 the coronavirus pandemic covid19 has spread globally in all countries where we conduct business the covid19 pandemic is evolving and has led to the implementation of various responses including governmentimposed quarantines stayathome orders and lockdowns travel restrictions vaccination and testing requirements and other public health safety measures these restrictions continue to change as covid19 evolves variants are discovered and vaccinations are distributed in each country and region 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy as well as to businesses and capital markets around the world covid19 has interfered and may continue to interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base in addition covid19 may negatively affect our customers’ businesses which may result in delayed or reduced purchases from us some customers may also have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us resulting in late payments or an inability of some customers to make payments at all 

as the covid19 pandemic continues we may experience volatility in our results including reduced global sales volume from lower customer demand our operations could be negatively affected if our employees are subject to governmental covid19 curfews stayathome orders lockdowns or facility closures or if they are quarantined or become ill as a result of exposure to covid19 

future impacts to the companys business as a result of covid19 and its variants could also include disruptions to the companys manufacturing operations caused by lockdowns facility closures reductions in operating hours staggered shifts and other social distancing efforts and labor shortages the emergence of the omicron variant of covid19 in late 2021 has presented particular challenges to the global economy given its high level of transmissibility which can cause many people to be affected at the same time or over a short period of time leading to potential disruptions to our business and supply chain our supply chain is currently facing wideranging global challenges although we have been able to meet delivery requirements of our customers with some interruption we continue to closely monitor risks associated with our supply chain including the availability of certain components material shortages supplier delays potential transportation delays and higher transportation and material costs 

global inflation also significantly increased during 2021 related to the covid19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand logistics and labor markets these inflationary conditions could have a negative impact on our operating results in future years disruptions in labor markets including a new competitive landscape created by remote work capabilities could also lead to higher attrition increased compensation levels and longer recruiting cycles 

uncertainties and challenges related to covid19 including new variants such as omicron lockdowns and logistical and inflationary challenges and the resulting impact to the economy continue in all regions of the world and market conditions may change quickly while it is difficult to estimate the 

extent and duration of any covid19 implications the effects on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic uncertainty in many parts of the world including regional effects of the covid19 pandemic international trade disputes and sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states are situations that we monitor closely if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

• a drop in demand for our products 

• companies being unable to finance their businesses 

• difficulty in obtaining materials and supplies 

• potential devaluation andor impairment of assets 

• difficulty in collecting accounts receivables 

• an increase in accounts receivable writeoffs and 

• greater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow 

economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations accounted for 21 of sales to external customers approximately 36 of our global production and 35 of total segment profit during 2021 in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us including the following 

• local tariffs and trade barriers 

• additions or revisions to a countrys legal and regulatory requirements 

• difficulties in staffing and managing local operations andor mandatory salary increases 

• credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors 

• difficulties in protecting intellectual property 

• nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property plant and equipment inventory and accounts receivable as well as 590 million of cash at december 31 2021 in our chinese subsidiaries 

• restrictions on investments andor limitations regarding foreign ownership 

• adverse tax consequences including tax disputes and imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries 

• the adoption of new or expansion of current travel restrictions or the intensification of trade wars 

• domestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition 

• other uncertain local economic political and social conditions including inflation hyperinflation and other decreases in purchasing power or periods of low or no productivity growth and 

• credit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers 

we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations or these regulations are amended to make it more difficult to repatriate the funds we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item while we continue to do business in russia we follow all relevant laws and regulations sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets especially china can be volatile and change quickly 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders support our customers and bill collect and make payments our internally developed system and processes as well as those provided by thirdparty vendors may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents such as terrorist or hacker attacks the introduction of malicious computer viruses ransomware falsification of banking and other information insider risk or other security breaches if there is a cybersecurity incident we may suffer interruptions in service loss of assets or data or reduced functionality many of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees customers or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage critical information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information if a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information whether or not caused by us we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition 

while we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures including mandatory quarterly ongoing employee training and awareness technical security controls enhanced data protection and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident despite any precautions we may take a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents 

in addition regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection worldwide such as the european general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products or services we expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement if we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent or negligent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges system failures in our products andor software cause or contribute to a loss whether or not caused by us we could face harm to our reputation and our financial condition and legal liability 

we have also been implementing our blue ocean program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period we have implemented the program in our us chinese swiss german uk benelux spain japan and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have approximately 85 of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years if our implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the program has increased our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as the covid19 pandemic described on page 14 global supply chain and production issues strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions cybersecurity attacks fire earthquakes hurricanes floods rising water levels other weather events or natural disasters including the potential impacts of climate change or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales it may be expensive to resolve these 

issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply and disruption of these sources whether as a result of issues with our suppliers operation or the timely availability of shipments from freight carriers could affect our ability to manufacture products the covid19 pandemic has caused numerous disruptions to supply chains often resulting in delivery delays inflated costs and increases in shipping rates even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing customer service and support and operational excellence throughout our supply chain we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business in addition to financial risk actions of some of our distributors could cause reputational harm especially if our products are involved risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

our business involves certain operating risks and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses of liabilities we might incur in our operations 

we have procured various insurance policies for certain types of insurance coverage and in varying coverage amounts our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur 

in our operations furthermore our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage we also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

strategic risks 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged global economic downturn a downturn affecting one or more of these industries or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers’ ability to purchase our products 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering or expanding their presence which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results we are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions 

financial risks 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro chinese renminbi and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 19 million to 21 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 29 million to 31 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2021 we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 343 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2021 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 6486 million and other intangible assets of 3075 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transaction and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses and to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products for information on the impact of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union see risk factors — the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

legal tax regulatory and other risks 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates including the potential implementation of various us tax proposals changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing application of tax law 

governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations 

the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has recently proposed changes to the current transfer pricing arm’s length standard for allocating profit as well as a 15 minimum tax by jurisdiction while the provision to alter the way profit is allocated by jurisdiction is not expected to impact the company the 15 minimum tax by jurisdiction may adversely impact the companys global tax provision additionally the us has proposed certain changes in the way us multinational companies are taxed which may also result in higher tax obligations 

any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings share repurchases or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability potential oecd changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical and food and beverage which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and profitability 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations united states trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other political policies in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability 

political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may impact global trade and domestic purchasing or create uncertainty the united states government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases has sought to renegotiate or possibly terminate certain existing trade agreements the united states government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods particularly those produced in china as a result certain foreign governments including the chinese government have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the united states certain governments also have implemented domestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition and result in reduced sales 

these various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lowercost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty negatively impact global markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn andor could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates see above description currency fluctuations affect our operating profits in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance 

the united kingdom ’ s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu commonly referred to as brexit after a transition period on december 24 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade deal the trade and cooperation agreement which was ratified by the uk on december 30 2020 this trade and cooperation agreement came into effect on may 1 2021 after it was ratified by both the european parliament and council of the european union the trade and cooperation agreement allows the uk and eu to continue trading without tariffs or quotas however the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the eu may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure 

in addition there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the uk and its relationship with the eu and the application and interpretation of the trade and cooperation agreement and brexitrelated matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved in particular the trade and cooperation agreement only covers the trade of goods and therefore uncertainty remains over the uks longterm trading of services relationship with the eu at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of brexit on our business however brexit could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we have corporate programs in place to manage compliance and stakeholder expectations related to environmental matters but increasing public interest in climate change 

topics may result in the enactment of additional governmental laws and regulations related to this subject area we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers and other stakeholders who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cannot satisfy customers’ demands we may lose business and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program 

risks related to our debt 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2021 we had total indebtedness of approximately 16 billion net of cash of 986 million our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 125 billion our credit facility is provided by a group of 14 financial institutions which individually have between 4 and 11 of the total funding commitment at december 31 2021 we had borrowings of 6010 million outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 125 billion amount available 

we are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of libor 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intended to phase out the london interbank offered rate libor by the end of 2021 on november 30 2020 to facilitate an orderly libor transition the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance 

corporation and the board of governors of the federal reserve jointly announced that entering into new contracts using libor as a reference rate after december 31 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk on march 5 2021 the financial conduct authority announced that all libor benchmarks will either no longer be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative after december 31 2021 in the case of oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor and after june 30 2023 in the case of the remaining us dollar libor benchmarks as mentioned in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our current interest rate swap cross currency swap and credit agreements include fallback protocols when libor is discontinued changes in the method of calculating libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs in addition if changes are made to the method of calculating libor or libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain contracts including our credit facility and swap arrangements and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated this may also result in an increase in our interest expense 

general risk factors 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

• the outlook for our endmarkets and the global economy 

• the impact of external factors on our competition 

• the financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services 

• the estimated costs of purchasing materials 

• the estimated costs of transportation and logistics 

• developments in personnel costs 

• our estimated income tax expense and 

• rates for currency exchange particularly between the swiss franc and the euro and between the chinese renminbi and the us dollar 

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

• our ability to implement our business strategy 

• our ability to implement price increases as forecasted 

• the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our spinnaker market penetration and field turbo initiatives 

• the effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business including growth globalization and productivity initiatives 

• our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services 

• the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets and 

• the effectiveness of productivity and cost saving initiatives 

these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions our spinnaker sales and marketing program and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 21 in 2021 and 3 in 2020 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 18 in 2021 and 2 in 2020 in 2021 we experienced broadbased growth with robust customer demand in most businesses and regions as global economies recovered from covid19 we also benefited from excellent execution of our sales and marketing programs and effectively navigated supply chain challenges to meet heightened customer demand growth in china was particularly strong we continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base innovative product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities increasing digitalization tools and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes 

during the past two years we accelerated our ability to use advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our global sales organization we have also successfully adapted to remote and hybrid work environments and increased engagement with our customers with our gotomarket and digital approaches while global market conditions are currently favorable challenges remain in the global supply chain and we will face difficult prior period comparisons in 2022 due to strong results in 2021 uncertainties and challenges relating to covid19 also continue including new variants such as omicron lockdowns logistical and inflationary challenges and the potential impact on global economies and market conditions may change quickly 

our laboratory sales experienced excellent growth in 2021 particularly from life sciences and biotech customers while other endmarkets such as the chemical industry experienced a strong recovery we also continue to support covid19 testing development treatment and vaccine production activities in biopharma we expect to continue to benefit from favorable biopharma market trends we also believe we will benefit from increased customer demand for automation digitalization and safety new facility investments and continued focus on regulatory compliance including data integrity requirements overall we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our laboratory business 

our industrial sales experienced strong growth in 2021 in both core industrial and product inspection core industrial experienced particularly strong growth especially in china and the americas we continue to benefit from our strong product offering and focus on the more attractive fastergrowing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region we also continue to benefit from market trends in automation and digitalization emerging market economies especially china have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies and we expect this to be a continued source of future growth our core industrialrelated products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth our product inspection business experienced improved customer demand during 2021 after being negatively impacted by covid19 in 2020 we 

expect our product inspection endmarket to also benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection food safety and productivity 

our food retailing sales decreased during 2021 primarily due to weak market dynamics the timing of project activity and the negative impact of component shortages traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other endmarkets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations 

in 2022 we will continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share innovation is essential to gaining market share and is fundamental in all aspects of our business including sales and marketing and technology leadership  our global sales and marketing initiative spinnaker continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include the use of advanced data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities we have also added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will make additional investments to frontend resources in 2022 we also continue to adapt our gotomarket approaches with additional inside and telesales resources while also increasing digital customer interaction we continue to benefit from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force in addition our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance we have also made adjustments to our service model to incorporate remote service depot dropoffpickup and other approaches to ensure the safety of our technicians and customers 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 36 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have nearly a 35year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 13 on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 over the years we have also broadened our product offering to the asian markets india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall versus the prior year we experienced a 20 increase in emerging market local currency sales by destination during 2021 which included 25 local currency sales growth in china within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food manufacturing chemical and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese government’s emphasis on science highvalue industries product quality and food safety we expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets however emerging market sales can be volatile in particular china has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5 of net sales on research and development we seek to improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software which we believe supports our pricing differentiation and accelerates product replacement cycles in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having thorough knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

expanding our margins during 2021 we experienced increased inflation in our cost structure particularly regarding material product costs and transportation and logistics and we expect our cost structure to further increase in 2022 due to these inflationary dynamics however despite these challenges to our cost structure we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services optimizing our cost structure and improving our mix in highermargin businesses such as service for example sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes we also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives highergrowthprofitable areas and opportunities for margin improvement 

we have also initiated various cost reduction programs over the past few years including temporary cost containment measures during 2020 in response to covid19 we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs and have increased our focus on these programs with our sterndrive initiative sterndrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain manufacturing and backoffice operations blue ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives our move to standardized business processes systems and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to realtime data our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels improving our order to cash cycle and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences process analytics and product inspection as three key areas for acquisitions for example in march 2021 we acquired all the membership interests of mayfair technology llc pendotech a manufacturer and distributor of singleuse sensors transmitters control systems and software for measuring monitoring and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications pendotech serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the united states the initial cash payment was 1850 million and we made other postclosing payments of 74 million we may be required to pay additional consideration of up to 200 million in october 2021 we also acquired scaleup systems inc a leading software provider for scaleup and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets the initial cash payment was 202 million and we may be required to pay additional amounts up to eur 30 million 

covid19 

since late 2019 the coronavirus pandemic covid19 has spread globally in all countries where we conduct business the covid19 pandemic is evolving and has led to the implementation of various responses including governmentimposed quarantines stayathome orders and lockdowns travel restrictions vaccination and testing requirements and other public health safety measures these restrictions continue to change as covid19 evolves variants are discovered and vaccinations are distributed in each country and region the emergence of the omicron variant of covid19 in late 2021 has presented particular challenges to the global economy given its high level of transmissibility which 

can cause many people to be affected at the same time or over a short period of time leading to potential disruptions to our business and supply chain 

the health and safety of our employees and business partners have been our highest priority throughout the covid19 pandemic and we have implemented several preventative and protective measures we also have continued to support our customers with their essential businesses such as life sciences food manufacturing chemicals eg sanitizers disinfectants soaps etc food retail and transportation and logistics 

our production and logistics facilities are currently operational and our officebased employees continue to adhere to any applicable jurisdictional stayathome orders our supply chain is currently facing wideranging global challenges although we have been able to meet delivery requirements of our customers with some interruption we continue to closely monitor risks associated with our supply chain including the availability of certain components material shortages supplier delays potential transportation delays and higher transportation and material costs which could significantly adversely affect sales andor profitability in future quarters we also continue to leverage our digital and remote sales capabilities and our service organization continues to provide onsite and remote customer support to facilitate uptime productivity and regulatory compliance 

covid19 presents several risks to our business as further described on page 14 in the risk factors section of this form 10k uncertainties related to covid19 and the resulting impact to the global economy continue in most regions of the world and market conditions can change quickly the longerterm effects on our business will be influenced by the global economy and any economic implications in different regions of the world

liquidity capital resources and future cash requirements 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments sources of liquidity include cash flows from operating activities available borrowings under our credit agreement the ability to obtain appropriate financing and our cash and cash equivalent balances currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions can be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement local working capital facilities and cash balances will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 9088 million in 2021 compared to 7247 million in 2020 and 6035 million in 2019 the increase in 2021 is primarily due to higher net earnings 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 1076 million in 2021 925 million in 2020 and 973 million in 2019 capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2022 similarly as we experienced in 2021 subject to business and economic conditions 

in september 2021 the company entered into an agreement with the us department of defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics the company will receive funding of 358 million over the next two years which will offset future capital expenditures 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in march 2021 we acquired all the membership interests of mayfair technology llc pendotech a manufacturer and distributor of singleuse sensors transmitters control systems and software for measuring monitoring and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications pendotech serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the united states the initial cash payment was 1850 million and we made other postclosing payments of 74 million we may be required to pay additional consideration of up to 200 million in october 2021 the company acquired scaleup systems inc a leading software provider for scaleup and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets the initial cash payment was 202 million and the company may be required to pay additional amounts up to eur 30 million for additional information related to these acquisitions refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 83 million 62 million and 20 million respectively 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2021 primarily comprised share repurchases in accordance with our share repurchase program we spent 10 billion in 2021 and 775 million in both 2020 and 2019 on the repurchase of 739486 shares 815652 shares and 1094648 shares respectively our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares however in 2022 we intend to spend a similar amount on the repurchase of shares as we spent in 2021 subject to business and economic conditions 

we plan to continue to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested we believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes and credit facility agreement 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2021 



1 see note 6 and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the credit agreement 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 6490 million of additional borrowings were available under our credit agreement and we maintained 986 million of cash and cash equivalents we expect to make interest payments of approximately 50 million during 2022 associated with our debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december 31 2021 

senior notes 

the senior notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semiannually the senior notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2021 we entered into an agreement to issue and sell 300 million 15year senior notes in a private placement we will issue 150 million with a fixed interest rate of 281 281 senior notes in march 2022 which will mature in march 2037 and we will issue 150 million with a fixed interest rate of 291 291 senior notes in september 2022 which will mature in september 2037 we will use the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 

in may 2021 we entered into an agreement to issue and sell 125 million 12year senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 283 the senior notes were issued in july 2021 and will mature in july 2033 

we used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 

credit agreement 

on june 25 2021 we entered into a 125 billion credit agreement the credit agreement which amended our 11 billion amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement which is further described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

other local arrangements 

in april 2018 two of our nonus pension plans issued loans totaling 396 million swiss franc 38 million to a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of swiss franc libor plus 875 basis points the loans were renewed for one year in april 2021 

share repurchase program 

in november 2020 the company’s board of directors authorized an additional 25 billion to the share repurchase program which has 21 billion of remaining availability as of december 31 2021 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities borrowings and cash balances repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 302 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2021 at a total cost of 69 billion during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we spent 10 billion and 7750 million on the repurchase of 739486 shares and 815652 shares at an average price per share of 135227 and 95014 respectively we reissued 110748 shares and 162176 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2021 and 2020 respectively 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro chinese renminbi and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 19 million to 21 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 29 million to 31 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2021 we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar 

against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 343 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the mettlertoledo international inc group of companies is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products as well as transportation and logistical costs the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices global inflation significantly increased during 2021 related to the covid19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand logistics and labor markets these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date these inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 04 million at december 31 2021 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2021 a 100basispoint change in interest rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of approximately 02 million any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 34 million at december 31 2021 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2021 a 100basispoint change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately 42 million any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue income taxes inventories goodwill and intangibles leases and pensions and other postretirement benefits we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the valuation allowance of 511 million as of december 31 2021 is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the valuation allowance in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be nonus withholding taxes certain state taxes and us taxes on currency gains if any all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 9494 million for the year ended december 31 2021 each increase of 95 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2021 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 were 06 million and 1419 million respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2021 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 were 91 million and 10 billion respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2021 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 01 million and 09 million respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2021 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 575 for the us plan and 378 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 90 million after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2021 the weighted average discount rate assumption was 26 for the us plan and 04 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries 

where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 117 million after tax 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2021 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 6486 million and other intangible assets of 3075 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change

we hold over 5000 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland china the european union germany the united kingdom italy france japan south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed 

checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will be approximately a total of 04 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range application and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets 

competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a risk factors 

factors affecting our future operating results 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected and will likely continue to negatively affect various aspects of our business including our workforce and supply chain and make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and has resulted in and will likely continue to result in reduced demand from our customers as their businesses may also be negatively affected 

our global operations are susceptible to global events that could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

for instance we are susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic covid19 which has spread globally resulting in millions of confirmed cases throughout the world and in all countries where we conduct business the pandemic has caused many governments to implement stayathome orders quarantines and significant restrictions on travel several governments have also implemented work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to their customary work locations and that require these employees to work remotely if possible quarantines travel bans work and other restrictions were initially put in place on a national level in china in january 2020 and with the global spread of the virus subsequently adopted in many other countries and regions with many restrictions in asia pacific europe north america and south america these restrictions continue to change as covid19 evolves in each country and region 

as a result of pandemic outbreaks including covid19 businesses can be shut down supply chains can be interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions covid19 interferes with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base in addition covid19 may negatively affect the global economy and our customers’ businesses which may result in delayed or reduced purchases from us some customers may also have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us resulting in late payments or an inability of some customers to make payments at all 

during the year ended december 31 2020 covid19 had a negative impact on our business primarily related to reduced global customer demand we remain cautious as uncertainties related to covid19 and the resulting impact to the economy continue in all regions of the world and market conditions may also change quickly with the global spread of the virus and related negative impact to the global economy we may experience reduced global sales volume from lower customer demand our operations could be negatively affected further if our employees who are currently not subject to stayathome or work restriction orders are quarantined or become ill as a result of exposure to covid19 or if they become subject to governmental covid19 curfews or stayathome orders the longerterm effects on our business will be impacted by the global economy and any recession implications in different regions of the world while it is extremely difficult to estimate the extent and duration of any covid19 implications the effects on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic uncertainty in many parts of the world including international trade disputes and sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states are situations that we monitor closely if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

• a drop in demand for our products 

• companies being unable to finance their businesses 

• difficulty in obtaining materials and supplies 

• potential devaluation andor impairment of assets 

• difficulty in collecting accounts receivables 

• an increase in accounts receivable writeoffs and 

• greater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow 

economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations accounted for 19 of sales to external customers approximately 32 of our global production and 32 of total segment profit during 2020 in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us including the following 

• local tariffs and trade barriers 

• additions or revisions to a countrys legal and regulatory requirements 

• difficulties in staffing and managing local operations andor mandatory salary increases 

• credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors 

• difficulties in protecting intellectual property 

• nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property plant and equipment inventory and accounts receivable as well as 432 million of cash at december 31 2020 in our chinese subsidiaries 

• restrictions on investments andor limitations regarding foreign ownership 

• adverse tax consequences including tax disputes and imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries 

• the adoption of new or expansion of current travel restrictions or the intensification of trade wars 

• other uncertain local economic political and social conditions including hyperinflationary conditions or periods of low or no productivity growth and 

• credit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers 

we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in 

china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets especially china can be volatile and change quickly 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders support our customers and bill collect and make payments our system and processes may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents such as terrorist or hacker attacks the introduction of malicious computer viruses ransomware falsification of banking and other information insider risk or other security breaches if there is a cybersecurity incident we may suffer interruptions in service loss of assets or data or reduced functionality many of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees customers or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage critical information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information if a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition 

while we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures including employee training and awareness technical security controls enhanced data protection and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident despite any precautions we may take a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents 

in addition regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection worldwide such as the european general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products or services we expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement if we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent or negligent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges system failures in our products andor software cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we have also been implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese uk benelux german us and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have more than 80 of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years if our implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the program has increased our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as the covid19 pandemic described on page 14 strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions cybersecurity attacks fire earthquakes hurricanes floods rising water levels or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify 

materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business in addition to financial risk actions of some of our distributors could cause reputational harm especially if our products are involved risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

our business involves certain operating risks and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses of liabilities we might incur in our operations 

we have procured various insurance policies for certain types of insurance coverage and in varying coverage amounts our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations furthermore our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage we also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

strategic risks 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged global economic downturn a downturn affecting one or more of these industries or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers’ ability to purchase our products 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering or expanding their presence which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results we are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or 

liabilities assumed such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions 

financial risks 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro chinese renminbi and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 20 million to 22 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2020 we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 252 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2020 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5503 million and other intangible assets of 1968 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in 

impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses and to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

legal tax regulatory and other risks 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing application of tax law 

governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd is also performing an economic impact study that is expected to develop a solution to the digital economy and also propose a supplement to the current transfer pricing arm’s length standard for allocating profit while the oecd’s current focus appears to be related to the digital economy and consumer businesses there is a possibility that the oecd also proposes changes to businesstobusiness transfer pricing regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the 

jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability potential oecd changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical and food and beverage which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and lower profitability 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations united states trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other political policies in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability 

political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty the united states government has recently adopted a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases to renegotiate or possibly terminate certain existing trade agreements the united states government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods particularly those produced in china as a result certain foreign governments including the chinese government have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the united states 

these various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lowercost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty negatively impact global markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn andor could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates see above description currency fluctuations affect our operating profits in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance 

the united kingdom ’ s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit on october 17 2019 the uk prime minister and the eu agreed to new terms for the country’s exit from the eu which received all necessary parliamentary approvals on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu and immediately entered into an 11month transition period during which all eu rules and trading agreements remained as they were on december 24 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade deal the “trade and cooperation agreement” which was ratified by the uk on december 30 2020 the trade and cooperation agreement is subject to formal approval by the european parliament and the council of the european union before it comes into effect and has been applied provisionally since january 1 2021 the trade and 

cooperation agreement allows the uk and eu to continue trading without tariffs or quotas however the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the eu may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure in addition there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the uk and its relationship with the eu and the application and interpretation of the trade and cooperation agreement and brexitrelated matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved in particular the trade and cooperation agreement only covers the trade of goods and therefore uncertainty remains over the uks longterm trading of services relationship with the eu at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of brexit on our business however brexit could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face 

difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cannot satisfy customers’ demands we may lose business and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program 

risks related to our debt 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2020 we had total indebtedness of approximately 12 billion net of cash of 943 million our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the 

restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 11 billion our credit facility is provided by a group of 15 financial institutions which individually have between 1 and 11 of the total funding commitment at december 31 2020 we had borrowings of 4975 million outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 11 billion amount available 

we are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of libor 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the london interbank offered rate libor by the end of 2021 changes in the method of calculating libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs in addition if changes are made to the method of calculating libor or libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain contracts including our credit facility and swap arrangements and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated this may also result in an increase in our interest expense 

general risk factors 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

• the outlook for our endmarkets and the global economy 

• the impact of external factors on our competition 

• the financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services 

• the estimated costs of purchasing materials 

• developments in personnel costs 

• our estimated income tax expense and 

• rates for currency exchange particularly between the swiss franc and the euro and between the chinese renminbi and the us dollar 

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

• our ability to implement our business strategy 

• our ability to implement price increases as forecasted 

• the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our spinnaker market penetration and field turbo initiatives 

• the effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business including growth globalization and productivity initiatives 

• our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services 

• the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets and 

• the effectiveness of productivity and cost saving initiatives 

these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions our spinnaker sales and marketing program and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 3 in 2020 and 2 in 2019 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 2 in 2020 and 5 in 2019 net sales in 2020 were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic which reduced global customer demand as further described below however we continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base innovative product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities increasing digitalization tools and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes during 2020 we accelerated our ability to use advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our global sales organization we also successfully adapted to a remote work environment and increased overall engagement with our customers with our gotomarket and digital approaches we remain cautious as 

uncertainties relating to covid19 and the global economy continue and market conditions may change quickly net sales in local currencies may be adversely affected in future quarters by the covid19 pandemic related to unfavorable economic conditions and reduced customer demand 

our laboratory sales experienced solid growth in 2020 particularly from life sciences and biotech customers we also benefited from covid19 testing and vaccine development and production preparation activities in biopharma we expect to continue to benefit from favorable biopharma market trends including the continued need for covid19 testing treatment and vaccine production activities we should also benefit from increased customer demand for automation digitalization and safety new facility investments and continued focus on regulatory compliance including data integrity requirements however other segments such as academia and certain segments of chemical were negatively impacted in 2020 and may continue to be challenging 

our industrial sales experienced a slight decline in 2020 as our product inspection business was particularly impacted in 2020 by reduced customer demand during covid19 core industrial experienced growth which included strong growth in china we continue to benefit from our focus on the more attractive fastergrowing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region emerging market economies especially china have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies and we expect this to be a continued source of future growth our core industrialrelated products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth we expect our industrial markets to also benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection food safety and productivity within our product inspection endmarket 

our food retailing sales decreased during 2020 primarily due to a lack of key account activity weak market conditions and minimal customer investments during covid19 traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other endmarkets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations 

in 2021 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include utilizing advanced data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities over the past few years we have also added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will consider additional investments to frontend resources as market conditions improve we also continue to adapt our gotomarket approaches with additional inside and telesales resources while also increasing digital customer interaction in 2020 we also benefited from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force in addition our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance in 2020 we also made 

adjustments to our service model to incorporate remote service depot dropoffpickup and other approaches to ensure the safety of our technicians and customers 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 35 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have more than a 30year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 12 on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 over the years we have also broadened our product offering to the asian markets india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall we experienced a 3 increase in emerging market local currency sales by destination during 2020 versus the prior year which included 7 local currency sales growth in china within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food manufacturing chemical and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese government’s emphasis on science highvalue industries product quality and food safety we expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets however emerging market sales can be volatile in particular china has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5 of net sales on research and development we seek to accelerate product replacement cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software which also support our pricing differentiation in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

expanding our margins we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services and optimizing our cost structure for example sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes we also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives highergrowth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various cost reduction programs over the past few years including temporary cost containment measures during 2020 in response to covid19 we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs and have increased our focus on these programs with our sterndrive initiative sterndrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain manufacturing and backoffice operations blue ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives our move to standardized business processes systems and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to realtime data our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels increasing our order to cash cycle and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences process analytics and product inspection as three key areas for acquisitions for example during 2017 we acquired biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs 

used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that was paid in the first quarter of 2019 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in millions of confirmed cases throughout the world and in all countries where we conduct business the outbreak has caused many governments to implement stayathome orders quarantines and significant restrictions on travel several governments have also implemented work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to their customary work locations and that require these employees to work remotely if possible quarantines travel bans work and other restrictions were initially put in place on a national level in china in january 2020 and with the global spread of the virus subsequently adopted in other countries and regions with many restrictions in asia pacific europe north america and south america these restrictions continue to change as covid19 evolves in each country and region 

the health and safety of our employees and business partners have been our highest priority throughout the covid19 pandemic and we have implemented several preventative and protective measures relating to social distancing hygiene health monitoring personal protective equipment split shifts and remote work we have also implemented business continuity plans and have been able to continue to support our customers with their essential businesses such as life sciences food manufacturing chemicals eg sanitizers disinfectants soaps etc food retail and transportation and logistics our production and logistics facilities are currently operational and our officebased employees have been able to work remotely in adherence to applicable jurisdictional stayathome orders our supply chain is currently continuing with minimal interruption and we generally maintain adequate product inventory levels and safety stock for certain components we quickly adapted to leverage our digital and remote sales and service capabilities while also meeting delivery requirements with our global supply chain our service organization also continues to provide onsite and remote customer support to facilitate uptime productivity and regulatory compliance 

we have also implemented various temporary cost containment measures related to workforce management and discretionary spending our workforce management measures primarily included reduced work hours salary freezes and voluntary senior leadership salary reductions 

we maintain adequate liquidity consisting of approximately 6025 million of additional borrowings available under our credit agreement and 943 million of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2020 

covid19 presents several risks to our business as further described on page 14 in the risk factors section of this form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2020 covid19 had a negative impact on our business primarily related to reduced customer demand we remain cautious as uncertainties related to covid19 and the resulting impact to the global economy continue in most regions of the world and market conditions can change quickly with the global spread of the virus and related negative impact to the global economy we may experience reduced global sales volume due to lower customer demand the longerterm effects on our business will be impacted by the global economy and any recession implications in different regions of the world while it is extremely difficult to estimate the extent and duration of any covid19 implications the effects on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 30 billion in 2019 and 29 billion in 2018 this represents an increase of 3 in 2020 and 2 in 2019 in us dollars and an increase of 2 in 2020 and 5 in 2019 in local currencies net sales were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic and related reduction in global customer demand on our operations however our competitive position increased due to our sophisticated sales and marketing program that was highly effective in the enhanced digital environment and we strengthened our brand with our ability to serve customers throughout the crisis our heightened focus on the most attractive market segments and differentiated resource allocation helped capture growth by pinpointing which customers would be most covid19 resilient and which would recover faster net sales during the second half of 2020 reflected improved customer demand in most businesses and regions with particularly strong growth in china and our laboratoryrelated products we continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs our innovative product portfolio and investments in our field organization particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques however we remain cautious as uncertainties relating to covid19 and the global economy continue and market conditions may change quickly net sales in local currencies may be adversely affected in future quarters by the covid19 pandemic related to unfavorable economic conditions and reduced customer demand 

in 2020 our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars compared to 2019 by 1 in the americas and 3 both in europe and in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2020 by 2 in the americas 1 in europe and 3 in asiarest of world with 7 growth in china a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased 2 both in us dollars and in local currencies during 2020 and increased 2 in us dollars and 4 in local currencies in 2019 service revenue including spare parts increased 3 in us dollars and 2 in local currencies in 2020 and increased 4 in us dollars and 7 in local currencies in 2019 

net sales of our laboratory products and services which represented approximately 54 of our total net sales in 2020 increased 6 in us dollars and 5 in local currencies during 2020 the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2020 includes very strong growth in pipettes as well as good results in automated chemistry and process analytics as previously mentioned our laboratoryrelated products in 2020 benefited from covid19 testing and vaccine development and production preparation activities 

net sales of our industrial products and services which represented approximately 40 of our total net sales in 2020 decreased 1 both in us dollars and in local currencies during 2020 the local currency decrease in net sales of our industrialrelated products during 2020 includes a decline in product inspection due to challenging market conditions offset in part by growth in core industrial products 

net sales of our food retailing products and services which represented approximately 6 of our total net sales in 2020 decreased 3 in us dollars and 4 in local currencies during 2020 the decline in food retailing is primarily due to challenging market conditions 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 584 for 2020 compared to 579 for 2019 and 574 for 2018 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 603 for 2020 compared to 604 for 2019 and 603 for 2018 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 516 for 2020 compared to 490 for 2019 and 470 for 2018 

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2020 primarily reflects favorable price realization benefits from temporary cost savings measures and material cost reductions offset in part by higher transportation costs and unfavorable business mix 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 45 for 2020 and 48 for both 2019 and 2018 research and development expenses in us dollars decreased 3 in 2020 and increased 2 in 2019 and in local currencies decreased 5 in 2020 and increased 5 in 2019 the decrease during 2020 relates to the timing of project activity and was impacted by our temporary cost savings measures 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 266 for 2020 compared to 272 for 2019 and 277 for 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were flat in us dollars and decreased 1 in local currencies in 2020 and increased 1 and 3 in us dollars and local currencies in 2019 respectively the decrease during 2020 includes benefits from our temporary and ongoing cost savings initiatives 

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 567 million in 2020 compared to 497 million and 475 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including our blue ocean program 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated various cost reduction measures for the year ended december 31 2020 we have incurred 105 million of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 15 and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2020 

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net income of 138 million 62 million and 218 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively other charges income net includes nonservice pension costs benefits net gains losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities interest income and other items nonservice pension benefits were 122 million 48 million and 62 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively other charges income net in 2018 also includes a onetime gain of 187 million associated with the settlement of the biotix acquisition contingent consideration as well as a onetime legal charge of 30 million 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 386 million for 2020 compared to 374 million for 2019 and 345 million for 2018 

our reported tax rate was 195 during 2020 compared to 177 and 214 during 2019 and 2018 respectively the 2019 reported tax rate includes a net benefit of 158 million associated with swiss tax reform described below the 2018 reported tax rate includes a charge of 36 million associated with the tax cuts and jobs act 

in may 2019 a public referendum was held in switzerland that approved swiss federal tax reform proposals previously approved by the swiss parliament additional changes in swiss cantonal law were enacted in october 2019 the changes in swiss federal tax had an immaterial effect on our financial statements we recognized a discrete noncash net deferred tax benefit of 158 million as a result of the enactment of the cantonal law in the fourth quarter of 2019 a further description of swiss tax reform is in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements

segment profit increased 64 million in our other segment during 2020 compared to a decrease of 68 million during 2019 the increase in segment profit during 2020 primarily includes increased sales volume and benefits from our temporary cost savings measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments sources of liquidity include cash flows from operating activities available borrowings under our credit agreement the ability to obtain appropriate financing and our cash and cash equivalent balances currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions can be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 7247 million in 2020 compared to 6035 million in 2019 and 5650 million in 2018 the increase in 2020 includes benefits from favorable working capital including strong cash collections and higher net earnings compared to the prior year 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 925 million in 2020 973 million in 2019 and 1427 million in 2018 we expect to make net investments in new or expanded manufacturing facilities of approximately 10 million to 15 million in 2021 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2020 primarily comprised share repurchases as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 815652 shares and 1094648 shares in the amount of 775 million during both 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness as further described in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 we acquired all of the shares of biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that was paid in the first quarter of 2019 we also recorded a onetime gain of 187 million during 2018 related to the settlement of the biotix acquisition contingent consideration 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 62 million 20 million and 55 million respectively 

we plan to continue to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested we believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes and credit facility agreement 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2020 



1 see note 6 and note 7 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the credit agreement 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 6025 million of additional borrowings were available under our credit agreement and we maintained 943 million of cash and cash equivalents changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt we were in compliance with our debt covenants at december 31 2020 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement local working capital facilities and cash balances will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

senior notes 

the senior notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semiannually the senior notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2020 we entered into an agreement to issue and sell eur 125 million of 15year 106 euro senior notes 106 euro senior notes the terms of the euro senior notes are consistent with the previous euro senior notes as described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the company also entered into a forward contract to receive 1521 million at the time of issuing the 106 

euro senior notes in march 2021 the proceeds will be used to repay outstanding amounts on the company’s credit facility and fund operational expenses 

credit agreement 

we have a 11 billion credit agreement the “credit agreement” which has 6025 million of availability remaining as of december 31 2020 the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of june 15 2023 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was set at libor plus 875 basis points as of june 15 2018 we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants as further described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2020 

other local arrangements 

in april 2018 two of our nonus pension plans issued loans totaling 396 million swiss franc 38 million to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of swiss franc libor plus 875 basis points the loans were renewed for one year in april 2020 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



1 in addition to the above table we also have liabilities for pension and postretirement funding and income taxes and transition tax liabilities of 43 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act however we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for income taxes or the timing and amounts beyond 2021 for pension and postretirement funding 

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect our results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

in november 2020 the company’s board of directors authorized an additional 25 billion to the share repurchase program which has 31 billion of remaining availability as of december 31 2020 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities borrowings and cash balances repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 294 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2020 at a total cost of 59 billion during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we spent 775 million in both years on the repurchase of 815652 shares and 1094648 shares at an average price per share of 95014 and 70797 respectively we reissued 162176 shares and 298002 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2020 and 2019 respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro chinese renminbi and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 20 million to 22 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2020 we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 252 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednon 

combined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 25 million at december 31 2020 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2020 a 100basispoint change in interest rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of approximately 12 million any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 194 million at december 31 2020 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2020 a 100basispoint change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately 34 million any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue income taxes inventories goodwill and intangibles leases and pensions and other postretirement benefits we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product we consider control to have transferred based upon shipping terms to the extent that our contracts have a separate performance obligation revenue related to any postshipment performance obligation is deferred until completed shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the endcustomer revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective except for rebate programs rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits the provisions for estimated returns and rebates are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 

certain of our product arrangements include separate performance obligations primarily related to installation such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have standalone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within our control the allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable standalone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of software applications we generally sell software products with the related hardware instrument as the software is usually embedded in the product our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed revenue from spare parts sold on a standalone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a timebased method these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the valuation allowance is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the valuation allowance in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be nonus withholding taxes certain state taxes and us taxes on currency gains if any all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 7487 million for the year ended december 31 2020 each increase of 75 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

inventories 

as of december 31 2020 inventories were 2976 million 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2020 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5503 million and other intangible assets of 1968 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

leases 

we consider an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration we have operating leases but do not have material financing leases as of december 31 2020 our balance sheet included a rightofuse asset of 986 million a shortterm lease liability of 292 million and a longterm lease liability of 698 million 

operating lease rightofuse assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement these assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the lease payments over the lease term 

the lease term reflects the noncancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when management is reasonably certain that it will exercise such option changes in the lease term assumption could impact the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet we apply our incremental borrowing rate assumption at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments as the information necessary to determine the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available the incremental borrowing rate reflects similar terms by geographic location to the underlying leases a change in the incremental borrowing rate assumption of 1 would impact the lease liability by approximately 31 million 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2020 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 were 13 million and 1499 million respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2020 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 were 62 million and 11 billion respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2020 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 01 million and 10 million respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2020 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 625 for the us plan and 373 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 87 million after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2020 the weighted average discount rate assumption was 22 for the us plan and 03 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 107 million after tax

we have a diversified customer base with no single endcustomer accounting for more than 1 of 2019 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographicallyfocused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against at december 31 2019  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 8150 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in approximately 40 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services as well as further expansion of our offerings to provide valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance performance enhancements application expertise and training and remote services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with fda and other international regulations and we can provide these services to most customers locations around the world our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts on demand services and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22 of our net sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations we also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistic processes 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 413 million in research and development  144 million in 2019  141 million in 2018  and 128 million in 2017  which is approximately 5 of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1300 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany the united kingdom and mexico we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand we expect to make net investments in new manufacturing facilities of approximately 15 million to 20 million in 2020 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total global workforce was 16200  including 14850 employees and 1350 temporary personnel as of december 31 2019  and includes approximately 6000 in europe 4700 in north and south america and 5500 in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years approximately 7200 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent employee interests 

sustainability 

sustainability touches all aspects of our business from designing sourcing and producing our products to selling and delivering them to our customers to handling them at the end of their lifecycle a sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers employees suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate our business we want to manage our business sustainably to position the company for longterm growth we designed our greenmt program to pursue environmental social and governance priorities where we can have a significant impact we do this in five key areas 1 keeping our operations sustainable over the longterm by ensuring we use resources efficiently 2 helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering green products and services 3 promoting responsible practices within our supply chain 4 ensuring an engaged workforce through fair attractive safe and developmentminded workplaces and 5 following corporate governance best practices we have set a number of goals relating to our greenmt sustainability program including reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental social and governance goals we report annually on our progress in our corporate responsibility report available on wwwmtcomsustainability 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses an enterprise architecture with a global singleinstance erp system within our it systems we continue to move toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we are also largely standardizing our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese uk benelux german and certain us and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have more than 80 of our users on the program and we will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland china the european union germany the united kingdom italy france japan south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites 

owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range application and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations accounted for 18 of sales to external customers approximately 30 of our global production and 34 of total segment profit during 2019  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets especially china can be volatile and change quickly while we experienced solid growth in china in 2019 we have also experienced sales declines in past years and we may see volatility in the future there is also currently economic uncertainty due in part to the prolonged tradetariff disputes with the united states in the shortterm we could also be impacted by the recent new strain of the wuhan coronavirus outbreak as further described on page 20 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic uncertainty in many parts of the world including international trade disputes and sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states are situations that we are monitoring closely if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 17 million to 19 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2019  we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 228 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent or negligent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges system failures in our products andor software cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese uk benelux german and certain us and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have more than 80 of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years if our implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the program has increased our 

reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack 

as described in the above section we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders support our customers and bill collect and make payments our system and processes may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents such as terrorist or hacker attacks the introduction of malicious computer viruses ransomware falsification of banking and other information insider risk or other security breaches if there is a cybersecurity incident we may suffer interruptions in service loss of assets or data or reduced functionality many of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees customers or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage critical information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information if a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition 

while we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures including employee training and awareness technical security controls enhanced data protection and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident despite any precautions we may take a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents 

in addition regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection worldwide such as the european gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products or services we expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement if we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in 

their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as the recent new strain of the wuhan coronavirus outbreak further described on page 20 strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions cybersecurity attacks fire earthquakes hurricanes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged global economic downturn a downturn affecting one or more of these industries or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing 

equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing application of tax law 

governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd is also performing an economic impact study that is expected to develop a solution to the digital economy and also propose a supplement to the current transfer pricing arms length standard for allocating profit while the oecds current focus appears to be related to the digital economy and consumer businesses there is a possibility that the oecd also proposes changes to businesstobusiness transfer pricing regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability potential oecd changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical and food and beverage which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and lower profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business in addition to financial risk actions of some of our distributors could cause reputational harm especially if our products are involved risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

a terrorism attack other geopolitical crisis or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the wuhan coronavirus outbreak could negatively affect various aspects of our business including our workforce and supply chain and make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

we are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the recent 2019 coronavirus outbreak first reported in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 wuhan coronavirus resulting in thousands of confirmed cases in china and many additional cases identified in other countries in which we conduct business the outbreak of the wuhan coronavirus has caused the chinese government to implement quarantines of wuhan and surrounding areas and implement significant restrictions on travel the chinese government has also implemented work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work these quarantines travel bans and other restrictions have been put in place on a national level until february 3 2020 with several provinces in which we have manufacturing facilities and sales offices extending that date to february 9 2020 at this time it is unclear if the chinese government will further extend any of the current restrictions or if further restrictions will be put into place by the government in addition many countries have placed significant bans on travel to and from china with many countries and airlines suspending flights to and from mainland china 

as a result of pandemic outbreaks including the wuhan coronavirus businesses can be shut down supply chains can be interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions governmental mandates may require forced shutdowns of our facilities for extended or indefinite periods in addition these widespread outbreaks of illness particularly in china north america europe or other locations especially asia pacific significant to our operations could adversely affect our workforce resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism pandemic outbreaks including the wuhan coronavirus could also substantially interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff which may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor 

obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cannot satisfy customers demands we may lose business and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations united states trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other political policies in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability 

political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty the united states government has recently adopted a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases to renegotiate or possibly terminate certain existing trade agreements the united states government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods particularly those produced in china and has raised the possibility of imposing further tariff increases or expanding the scope of the tariffs as a result certain foreign governments including the chinese government have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the united states 

in june 2016 voters in the uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit on october 17 2019 the uk prime minister and the eu agreed to new terms for the countrys exit from the eu which now has all necessary parliamentary approvals on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu the uk and the eu are now in a transition period where they have until the end of 2020 to attempt to negotiate a new trade agreement if the uk leaves the eu without being able to negotiate an agreement it may have an adverse impact on labor and trade and may create currency volatility in the absence of a future trade deal the uks trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization resulting in possible higher importation costs of our products in addition the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the eu may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of brexit on our business however brexit could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

these various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lowercost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty negatively impact global markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other government action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn andor could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates see above description currency fluctuations affect our operating profits in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering or expanding their presence which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results we are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5360 million and other intangible assets of 2062 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2019  we had total indebtedness of approximately 11 billion  net of cash of 2078 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 11 billion  our credit facility is provided by a group of 15 financial institutions which individually have between 1 and 11 of the total funding commitment at december 31 2019  we had borrowings of 5210 million outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 11 billion amount available 

we are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of libor 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the london interbank offered rate libor by the end of 2021 changes in the method of calculating libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs in addition if changes are made to the method of calculating libor or libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain contracts including our credit facility and swap arrangements and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated this may also result in an increase in our interest rate expense 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 2 in 2019 and 8 in 2018  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 5 in 2019 and 6 in 2018  net sales were reduced by 1 in 2019 related to a significant decline in food retailing as further explained below global market conditions were generally favorable during 2019 and we continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base innovative product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities increased digitalization tools and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes however market conditions are uncertain and can also change quickly particularly in emerging markets the wuhan coronavirus as further described on page 20 also creates uncertainties and risks and we expect our sales in china may decline during the first quarter 2020 economic uncertainties also exist in certain regions of the world including the potential impact from prolonged international tradetariff disputes 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2019 versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was favorable during 2019 and we benefited from our robust product portfolio and sales and marketing initiatives the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2019 included strong growth in most product categories 

our industrial sales benefited in 2019 from our focus on the more attractive fastergrowing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region emerging market economies especially china have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies and we expect this to be a continued source of future growth our core industrialrelated products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth we expect our industrial markets to continue to benefit from our customers focus on brand protection food safety and productivity within our product inspection endmarket however product inspection was impacted by a lack of global rollouts in the last two years at our large packaged food customers 

our food retailing sales decreased significantly during 2019 primarily due to unfavorable market conditions and the timing of project activity traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other end markets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations 

in 2020  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include leveraging of big data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities over the past few years we have also added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will look to continue to make investments to frontend resources in 2020 we have also added digitalization tools to gain efficiencies in our field sales force in addition our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage big data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or selling new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 34 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have more than a 30year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 13 on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 over the years we have also broadened our product offering to the asian markets india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall we experienced a 5 increase in emerging market local currency sales during 2019 versus the prior year which included 9 local currency 

sales growth in china within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food manufacturing chemical and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries product quality and food safety we expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets however emerging market sales can be volatile while chinese market conditions are currently favorable there is uncertainty including the potential impact of prolonged international trade disputes the chinese economy has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5 of net sales on research and development we seek to accelerate product replacement cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software which also support our pricing differentiation in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

expanding our margins we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services and optimizing our cost structure for example sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes we also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives highergrowth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various cost reduction programs over the past few years we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs and have increased our focus on these programs with of our sterndrive initiative sterndrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain manufacturing and backoffice operations blue ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives our move to standardized business processes systems and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to realtime data our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels increasing our order to cash cycle and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions for example during 2017 we acquired the shares of biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that was paid in the first quarter of 2019 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 30 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 29 billion in 2018 and 27 billion in 2017  this represents an increase of 2 in 2019 and 8 in 2018 in us dollars and an increase of 5 and 6 in local currencies respectively net sales were reduced by 1 in 2019 related to a significant decline in food retailing the biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1 to local currency sales in 2018 global market conditions were favorable during 2019 and we continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs our innovative product portfolio and 

investments in our field resources however we remain cautious due to uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment as previously mentioned the wuhan coronavirus also creates uncertainties and risks and we expect our sales in china may decline during the first quarter of 2020 

in 2019  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars 5 in the americas and 3 in asiarest of world and decreased 2 in europe in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2019 by 6 in the americas 3 in europe and 6 in asiarest of world net sales in the americas was reduced by 2 related to a significant decline in food retailing sales primarily due to unfavorable market conditions and the timing of project activity a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased 2 in us dollars and 4 in local currencies during 2019 and increased 8 and 6 in us dollars and in local currencies in 2018  the biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1 to our net sales of products during 2018 service revenue including spare parts increased 4 in us dollars and 7 in local currencies in 2019 and increased 8 and 6 in us dollars and in local currencies in 2018  

net sales of our laboratory products and services which represented approximately 52 of our total net sales in 2019  increased 5 in us dollars and 7 in local currencies during 2019  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2019 includes solid growth in most product categories especially analytical instruments process analytics and pipettes 

net sales of our industrial products and services which represented approximately 41 of our total net sales in 2019  increased 2 in us dollars and 4 in local currencies during 2019  the local currency increase in net sales of our industrialrelated products during 2019 includes strong growth in core industrial products and strong project activity in transportation and logistics 

net sales of our food retailing products and services which represented approximately 7 of our total net sales in 2019  decreased 11 in us dollars and 8 in local currencies during 2019  the decline in food retailing is primarily due to unfavorable market conditions and the timing of project activity 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 579 for 2019  compared to 574 for 2018 and 578 for 2017  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 604 for 2019  compared to 603 for 2018 and 611 for 2017  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 490 for 2019  compared to 470 for 2018 and 461 for 2017  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2019 reflects favorable price realization and productivity partially offset by tariff costs and initial costs associated with new product introductions 

in 2018 the us government enacted tariffs on certain products imported from china the tariffs became effective at various points during 2018 and the first half of 2019 we estimate the associated annualized cost increase is approximately 25 million assuming a 25 tariff rate we continue to implement various actions to mitigate the effect of these tariffs 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 48 for both 2019 and 2018  and 47 for 2017  research and development expenses in us dollars increased 2 in 2019 and 11 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 5 in 2019 and 9 in 2018  relating to increased project activity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 272 for 2019  compared to 277 for 2018 and 289 for 2017  selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 in us dollars and 3 in local currencies in 2019 and increased 2 and 1 in us dollars and local currencies in 2018  respectively the increase during 2019 includes investments in our field sales organization and growth initiatives offset in part by benefits from our cost savings initiatives 

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 497 million in 2019  compared to 475 million and 427 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including the companys blue ocean program 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated various cost reduction measures for the year ended december 31 2019  we have incurred 158 million of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 15 and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2019  

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net income of 62 million  218 million  and 99 million in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively other charges income net includes nonservice pension costs benefits net gains losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities interest income and other items nonservice pension benefits were 48 million  62 million  and 40 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively other charges income net in 2018 also includes a onetime gain of 187 million associated with the settlement of the biotix acquisition contingent consideration as well as a onetime legal charge of 3 million other charges income net in 2017 includes 17 million of acquisition costs and a onetime gain of 34 million relating to the sale of a facility in switzerland in connection with our initiative to consolidate certain swiss operations into a new facility 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 374 million for 2019  compared to 345 million for 2018 and 328 million for 2017  

our reported tax rate was 177 during 2019 compared to 214 and 345 during 2018 and 2017 respectively the 2019 reported tax rate includes a net benefit of 158 million associated with swiss tax reform described below the 2018 and 2017 reported tax rates include charges of 36 million and 72 million respectively associated with the tax cuts and jobs act described below 

in may 2019 a public referendum was held in switzerland that approved swiss federal tax reform proposals previously approved by swiss parliament additional changes in swiss cantonal law were enacted in october 2019 the changes in swiss federal tax had an immaterial effect on our financial statements we recognized a discrete noncash net deferred tax benefit of 158 million as a result of the enactment of the cantonal law in the fourth quarter of 2019 a further description of swiss tax reform is in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the act significantly revised us corporate income tax law the act includes among other things a reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and the implementation of a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax that is payable over a period of up to eight years the tax effects of the act are reflected in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the act we recorded charges of 36 million and 72 million during 2018 and 2017 respectively these amounts include an aggregate cash charge of 62 million for unrepatriated foreign earnings which is expected to be paid over a period of up to eight years beginning in 2018 and a noncash charge of 13 million related to certain deferred tax and other noncash items 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the 2019 increase of 5 in both total net sales and net sales to external customers includes particularly strong growth in laboratoryrelated products we also experienced strong growth in coreindustrial products partially offset by a significant decline in food retailing primarily due to unfavorable market conditions and the timing of project activity which reduced total net sales and net sales to external customers by 2 in 2019 

segment profit increased 485 million in our us operations segment during 2019  compared to a decrease of 161 million during 2018  the segment profit increase includes higher net sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion and facility consolidation initiatives offset in part by investments in our sales and service organization and initial costs of new product introductions 

swiss operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars increased 5 in 2019 and 9 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 6 in 2019 and 9 in 2018  net sales to external customers increased 4 in us dollars and 5 in local currencies in 2019  while net sales to external customers were flat in us dollars and local currencies in 2018 local currency net sales to external customers during 2019 includes strong growth in industrialrelated products especially product inspection 

segment profit increased 313 million in our swiss operations segment during 2019  compared to an increase of 276 million during 2018  segment profit includes benefits from our increased net sales volume and margin expansion and cost savings initiatives offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher research and development activity 

western european operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars decreased 2 in 2019 and increased 6 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 3 and 2 in 2019 and 2018  net sales to external customers in us dollars decreased 3 in 2019 and increased 7 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 3 in both 2019 and 2018  the increase in local currency net sales to external customers during 2019 includes strong growth in most laboratoryrelated products categories and core industrial products offset in part by declines in product inspection and food retailing 

segment profit increased 13 million in our western european operations segment during 2019  compared to a decrease of 13 million in 2018  segment profit during 2019 includes higher net sales and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives offset in part by increased research and development and sales and marketing investments initial costs associated with new product introductions and unfavorable currency translation 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars were flat in 2019 and increased 12 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 4 in 2019 and 10 in 2018  net sales by origin to external customers in us dollars increased 4 in 2019 and 16 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 8 in 2019 and 14 in 2018  the increase in net sales to external customers during 2019 reflects solid growth in laboratory and industrialrelated products while chinese market conditions have been favorable the chinese economy has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors in particular we expect our sales in china may decline during the first quarter of 2020 related to the wuhan coronavirus 

segment profit decreased 41 million in our chinese operations segment during 2019  compared to an increase of 388 million in 2018  the decrease in segment profit during 2019 includes unfavorable foreign currency translation increased sales and service investments and higher research and development activity offset in part by increased sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives 

other amounts in thousands 



 other includes reporting units in southeast asia latin america eastern europe and other countries total net sales and net sales to external customers in us dollars increased 3 in 2019 and 5 in 2018  and in local currencies increased 5 in both 2019 and 2018  respectively local currency growth in net sales to external customers included solid growth in most product categories 

segment profit decreased 68 million in our other segment during 2019  compared to an increase of 56 million during 2018  the decrease in segment profit during 2019 is primarily related to investments in field sales and service and unfavorable currency translation offset in part by increased local currency net sales 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions can be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 6035 million in 2019  compared to 5650 million in 2018 and 5163 million in 2017  the increase in 2019 includes higher net earnings and lower cash incentive payments of 18 million offset in part by the timing of working capital outflows 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 973 million in 2019  1427 million in 2018  and 1274 million in 2017  the decrease in 2019 is primarily related to prior year investments in manufacturing facilities we expect to make net investments in new manufacturing facilities of approximately 15 million to 20 million in 2020 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2019 included share repurchases as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1094648 shares and 802809 shares in the amount of 775 million and 475 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness as further described in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 we acquired all of the shares of biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that was paid in the first quarter of 2019 we also recorded a onetime gain of 187 million during 2018 related to the settlement of the biotix acquisition contingent consideration 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 20 million 55 million  and 21 million respectively 

as previously described we also recorded charges of 36 million and 72 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively for the estimated income tax effects of the transition tax associated with the tax cuts and jobs act of which 62 million is expected to be paid over a period of up to eight years we plan to continue to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested we believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes and credit facility agreement 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2019  



1 see note 6 and note 7 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the credit agreement 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

senior notes 

the senior notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semiannually the senior notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our covenants at december 31 2019 

we have designated the eur 125 million 147 euro senior notes and the eur 135 million 130 euro senior notes as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in a euro denominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency risk associated with this net investment changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income loss we recorded in other comprehensive 

income loss related to this net investment hedge an unrealized gain of 13 million and 67 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 and an unrealized loss of 182 million for the year ended december 31 2017 respectively we have a loss of 15 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2019 

on january 24 2020 we issued 50 million of fifteen year senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 319 which will mature january 24 2035 the terms of the senior notes are consistent with the previous senior notes as described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements we used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 

credit agreement 

we have a 11 billion credit agreement the “credit agreement” which has 5723 million of availability remaining as of december 31 2019 the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of june 15 2023 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was set at libor plus 875 basis points as of june 15 2018 we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants as further described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2019 

other local arrangements 

in april 2018 two of our nonus pension plans issued loans totaling 396 million swiss franc 38 million to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of swiss franc libor plus 875 basis points the loans were renewed for one year in april 2019 and as such are classified as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to 

materially affect our results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

in november 2018 the companys board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion to the share repurchase program which has 13 billion of remaining availability as of december 31 2019  the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities borrowings and cash balances repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 286 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2019  at a total cost of 52 billion  during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we spent 775 million and 475 million on the repurchase of 1094648 shares and 802809 shares at an average price per share of 70797 and 59165  respectively we reissued 298002 shares and 183379 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2019 and 2018  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 17 million to 19 million annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2019  we estimate that a 5 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of 228 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on 

our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 19 million at december 31 2019  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2019  a 100basispoint change in interest rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of approximately 27 million  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 47 million at december 31 2019  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2019  a 100basispoint change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in an change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately 40 million any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2019 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 were 21 million and 1425 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2019 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 were 103 million and 9613 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2019 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 06 million and 13 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the 

assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2019  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 625 for the us plan and 376 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 76 million after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2019  the weighted average discount rate assumption was 30 for the us plan and 05 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 89 million after tax 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2019  trade accounts receivable were 5663 million  net of a 170 million allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2019  inventories were 2743 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5360 million and other intangible assets of 2062 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the 

value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

if we are unable to conclude whether the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the valuation allowance is based on managements estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be nonus withholding taxes certain state taxes and us taxes on currency gains if any all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 6814 million for the year ended december 31 2019  each increase of 68 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product we consider control to have transferred based upon shipping terms to the extent that our contracts have a separate performance obligation revenue related to any postshipment performance obligation is deferred until completed shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the endcustomer revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective except for rebate programs rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits the provisions for estimated returns and rebates are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 

certain of our product arrangements include separate performance obligations primarily related to installation such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have standalone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within our control the allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable standalone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of software applications we generally do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is usually embedded in the product our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed revenue from spare parts sold on a standalone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a timebased method these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period 

leases 

we consider an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration we have operating leases but do not have material financing leases as of december 31 2019 our balance sheet included a rightofuse asset of 873 million a shortterm lease liability of 276 million and a longterm lease liability of 609 million 

operating lease rightofuse assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement these 

assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the lease payments over the lease term 

the lease term reflects the noncancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when management is reasonably certain that it will exercise such option changes in the lease term assumption could impact the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet we apply our incremental borrowing rate assumption at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments as the information necessary to determine the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available the incremental borrowing rate reflects similar terms by geographic location to the underlying leases a change in the incremental borrowing rate assumption of 1 would impact the lease liability by approximately 26 million

we have a diversified customer base with no single endcustomer accounting for more than 1  of 2018 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against at december 31 2018  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 7900 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in approximately 40  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 389 million  in research and development  1411 million  in 2018  1283 million  in 2017  and 1192 million  in 2016  which is approximately 5  of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1300 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany the united kingdom and mexico we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand we expect to make net investments in a new manufacturing facility of approximately 15 million over the next two years 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

 9 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total global workforce was 16000  including 14200  employees and 1800  temporary personnel as of december 31 2018  and includes approximately 6000  in europe 4700  in north and south america and 5300  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a substantial number of our employees approximately 600  employees in germany and france are represented by unions 

sustainability 

sustainability touches all aspects of our business from designing and producing our products to selling and delivering them to our customers to handling them at the end of their lifecycle sustainability helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers employees suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate our business we want to manage our business sustainably to position the company for longterm growth our greenmt program is designed to help save energy and resources we do this in four key areas 1 developing products using our design for environment criteria that allow us and our customers to reduce energy usage material and product waste 2 implementing energy efficiency projects to reduce energy usage at our sites 3 managing our sales and service fleets to reduce our fuel consumption and 4 reducing the environmental impact of our resource consumption especially in processes related to cooling and packaging our goal is to reduce our carbon footprint by the end of 2025 by 30 relative co2 emissions per net sales compared with 2010 and at the same time realize financial benefits 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses an enterprise architecture with a global singleinstance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese uk benelux german and certain us and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have more than 80 of the program completed as measured in users we will continue to implement the program in additional locations over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland the european union germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

 10 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 11 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations accounted for 18  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 37  of total segment profit during 2018  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets especially china can be volatile and change quickly while we experienced strong growth in china in 2018 we have also experienced sales declines in recent years and we may see volatility in the future there is also currently economic uncertainty including the potential impact of international tradetariff disputes 

 14 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic uncertainty in many parts of the world including international trade disputes and sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states are situations that we are monitoring closely if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million  to 18 million  annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 15 million  to 17 million  annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2018  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 301 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

 15 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent or negligent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products andor software to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges system failures in our products andor software cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese uk benelux german and certain us and southeast asia operations we estimate that we have more than 80 of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single 

 16 

information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack 

as described in the above section we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders support our customers and bill collect and make payments our system and processes may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents such as terrorist or hacker attacks the introduction of malicious computer viruses ransomware falsification of banking and other information insider risk or other security breaches if there is a cybersecurity incident we may suffer interruptions in service loss of assets or data or reduced functionality many of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees customers or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage 

customer may use our products andor software to generate or manage critical information though we take steps to ensure our products andor software are secure it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information if a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition 

while we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures including employee training and awareness technical security controls enhanced data protection and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident despite any precautions we may take a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 17 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions cyber attacks fire earthquakes hurricanes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our 

 18 

effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

a terrorism attack other geopolitical crisis or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters also in past years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu and more recently ebola outbreaks in parts of africa despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such events businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work these events particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 19 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we have implemented may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

 20 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cant satisfy customers demands we may lose business and if we cant meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations changes in united states trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability 

changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty the united states government has announced its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases to renegotiate or possibly terminate certain existing trade agreements the united states government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods particularly those produced in china and has raised the possibility of imposing further tariff increases or expanding the scope of the tariffs as a result certain foreign governments including the chinese government have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the united states 

these actions may restrict our access to lowercost countries or otherwise create uncertainty in global markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other government action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn andor could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates see above description currency fluctuations affect our operating profits in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance 

in june 2016 voters in the uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit the timing of the proposed exit is currently scheduled for march 2019 with a transition period running through december 2020 brexit has created political and economic uncertainty that may have a negative impact on uk european and global economic conditions international trade flows and foreign currency translation at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of brexit on our business however brexit could adversely effect our operating results and financial condition 

 21 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results we are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2018  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5348 million  and other intangible assets of 2173 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2018  we had total indebtedness of approximately 8566 million  net of cash of 1781 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

 22 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 11 billion  our credit facility is provided by a group of 15  financial institutions which individually have between 1  and 11  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2018  we had borrowings of 4932 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 11 billion  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking 

 23 

statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 24 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 8  in 2018  and 9  in 2017  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 6  in 2018  and 8  in 2017  net sales growth in local currencies during 2018 reflected strong execution of our growth initiatives and   favorable global market conditions we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base innovative product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes however economic conditions can also change quickly particularly in emerging markets and it is uncertain that favorable market conditions will continue we also remain cautious as economic uncertainties exist in certain regions of the world especially the potential impact of international tradetariff disputes 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2018  versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was 

 31 

favorable during 2018  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2018  was driven by strong growth in most product categories 

our industrial markets experienced favorable market conditions in china with strong growth despite challenging prior period comparisons emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries however our core industrialrelated products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth we also expect our industrial markets to continue to benefit from our customers focus on brand protection and food safety within our product inspection endmarket 

our food retailing sales increased during 2018  with strong project activity in the americas traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations 

in 2019  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy for example over the past few years we have added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will look to continue to make investments to frontend resources in 2019 we also aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include leveraging big data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage big data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or selling new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 35  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have approximately a 30year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 14  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 over the years we have also broadened our product offering to the asian markets india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall market conditions in emerging markets were favorable during 2018  we experienced a 10  increase in emerging market local currency sales during 2018  versus the prior year which included 13 local currency sales growth in china within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food safety chemical and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets however emerging market sales can 

 32 

be volatile while chinese market conditions are currently favorable there is uncertainty including the potential impact of international trade disputes the chinese economy has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to accelerate product replacement cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software which also supports our pricing differentiation in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

expanding our margins we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services and optimizing our cost structure for example sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes we also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives highergrowth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various cost reduction programs over the past few years as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs and have further increased our focus on these programs during the past two years with the global launch of our sterndrive initiative sterndrive is our global program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain manufacturing and backoffice operations blue ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives our move to standardized business processes systems and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to realtime data our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions for example during 2017 we acquired the shares of biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that will be paid in the first quarter of 2019 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 29 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 27 billion  in 2017  and 25 billion  in 2016  this represents an increase of 8  in 2018  and 9  in 2017  in us dollars and an increase of 6  and 8  in local currencies respectively the biotix and troemner acquisitions contributed approximately 1  to local currency sales in 2018 and 2017 global market conditions were favorable during 2018 and we continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs our innovative product portfolio and investments in our field resources however we remain cautious as market conditions are subject to change and economic uncertainties exist particularly concerning international tradetariff disputes 

in 2018  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars 5  in the americas 7  in europe and 12  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2018  by 5  in the americas 4  in europe and 10  in asiarest of world the biotix and 

 33 

troemner acquisitions contributed approximately 1  and 2 to net sales in the americas during 2018 and 2017 respectively a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

as described in note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased 8  in us dollars and 6 in local currencies during 2018  and increased 9  in both us dollars and in local currencies in 2017  the biotix and troemner acquisitions contributed approximately 1  and 2 to our net sales of products during 2018 and 2017 respectively service revenue including spare parts increased 8  in us dollars and 6 in local currencies in 2018  and increased 7  in both us dollars and in local currencies in 2017  

net sales of our laboratory products and services which represented approximately 51  of our total net sales in 2018  increased 11  in us dollars and 9  in local currencies during 2018  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratory products during 2018  includes strong growth in most product categories especially process analytics pipettes and automated chemistry the biotix acquisition also contributed approximately 2  to our net sales growth of laboratoryrelated products and services

net sales of our food retailing products and services which represented approximately 8  of our total net sales in 2018  increased 5  in us dollars and 3  in local currencies during 2018  food retailing experienced strong project activity in the americas while net sales in europe declined in 2018 related to reduced customer activity 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 574  for 2018  compared to 578  for 2017  and 573  for 2016

the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2018  was primarily due to initial costs associated with a new manufacturing facility and product introductions tariff costs and unfavorable business mix offset in part by favorable price realization 

in 2018 the us government enacted tariffs on certain products imported from china the tariffs became effective at various points during 2018 we estimate the associated annualized cost increase is approximately 25 million assuming a 25 tariff rate we continue to evaluate and implement various actions to mitigate the effect of these tariffs 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 48  for 2018  47 for 2017  and   48  for 2016  research and development expenses in us dollars increased 11  in 2018  and 8  in 2017  and in local currencies increased 9  in 2018  and 8  in 2017  relating to increased project activity

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 475 million  in 2018  compared to 427 million  and 361 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including the companys blue ocean program as well as the biotix acquisition 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated various cost reduction measures for the year ended december 31 2018  we have incurred 184 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 15 and note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2018

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 345 million  for 2018  compared to 328 million  for 2017  and 280 million  for   2016  

our reported tax rate was 214 during 2018 compared to 345 and 238 in 2017 and 2016 respectively the 2018 and 2017 reported tax rates include charges of 36 million and 72 million respectively associated with the tax cuts and jobs act described below 

 35 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the act significantly revised us corporate income tax law the act includes among other things a reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and the implementation of a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax that is payable over a period of up to eight years the tax effects of the act are reflected in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the act we recorded charges of 36 million and 72 million during 2018 and 2017 respectively these amounts include an aggregate cash charge of 62 million for unrepatriated foreign earnings which is expected to be paid over a period of up to eight years beginning in 2018 and a noncash charge of 13 million related to certain deferred tax and other noncash items 

our accounting for the above items is based upon reasonable estimates of the tax effects of the act however our estimates may change upon additional interpretive guidance from regulatory authorities 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in both total net sales and net sales to external customers of 7  in 2018  reflects particularly strong results in our laboratory products as well as strong food retailing project activity these results were offset in part by a decrease in product inspection which had strong growth in 2017 net sales to external customers in our us operations during 2018 also benefited approximately 3  from the biotix acquisition 

segment profit decreased 161 million  in our us operations segment during 2018  compared to an increase of 162 million  during 2017  primarily due to initial costs associated with a new manufacturing facility and new product introductions continued investments in our field and service organization and increased tariff costs offset in part by benefits from our margin expansion initiatives 

swiss operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars increased 9  in 2018  and 6  in 2017  and in local currencies increased 9 in 2018  and 6 in 2017  net sales to external customers in us dollars and local currencies 

 36 

were flat in 2018  compared to an increase of 2  in us dollars and local currencies in 2017  net sales to external customers includes growth in industrialrelated products offset by a decline in food retailing 

segment profit increased 276 million  in our swiss operations segment during 2018  compared to an increase of 108 million  during 2017  segment profit includes the impact of increased intersegment sales volume our margin expansion initiatives and favorable currency translation offset in part by higher research and development activity 

western european operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars increased 6  in 2018  and 3 in 2017  and in local currencies increased 2 in both 2018  and 2017  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased 7  in 2018  and 5  in 2017  and in local currencies increased 3 in both 2018  and 2017  the increase in local currency net sales to external customers during 2018  includes growth in most product categories offset in part by a decline in food retailing related to reduced project activity 

segment profit decreased 13 million  in our western european operations segment during 2018  compared to a decrease of 52 million  in 2017  the decrease in segment profit for 2018 includes higher research and development activity an intersegment product transfer and rollin costs associated with our blue ocean program offset by benefits from our margin expansion initiatives and favorable currency translation 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 



 total net sales in us dollars increased 12  in 2018  and 13  in 2017  and in local currencies increased 10 in 2018  and 15 in 2017  net sales by origin to external customers in us dollars increased 16  in 2018  and 17 in 2017  and in local currencies increased 14 in 2018  and 19 in 2017  the increase in net sales to external customers during 2018  reflects strong growth in most product categories especially laboratory products while chinese market conditions are currently favorable there is uncertainty including the potential impact of international tradetariff disputes the chinese economy has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors 

segment profit increased 388 million  in our chinese operations segment during 2018  compared to an increase of 439 million  in 2017  the increase in segment profit during 2018 includes increased net sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives offset in part by incremental investments in sales and marketing 

 37 

 other amounts in thousands 



 other includes reporting units in southeast asia latin america eastern europe and other countries total net sales and net sales to external customers in us dollars increased 5  in 2018  and 8  in 2017  and in local currencies increased 5 and 6 in 2018  and 2017  respectively local currency sales growth during 2018 reflects strong growth in laboratory and coreindustrial products 

segment profit increased 56 million  in our other segment during 2018  compared to an increase of 85 million  during 2017  the increase in segment profit during 2018  is primarily due to our increased sales volume benefits from our margin expansion initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation offset in part by increased sales and service investments 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions can be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 5650 million  in 2018  compared to 5163 million  in 2017  and 4608 million  in 2016  the increase in 2018  is primarily related to higher net earnings offset in part by higher cash incentive payments the timing of tax payments and a transition tax payment of 42 million see below 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 1427 million  in 2018  1274 million  in 2017  and 1240 million  in 2016  the increase is primarily related to investments in manufacturing facilities and information technology we expect to make net investments in a new manufacturing facility of approximately 15 million over the next two years 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2018  included share repurchases as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 802809 shares and 749254 shares in the amount of 475 million  and 400 million  during 2018  and 2017  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness as further described in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 we acquired all of the shares of biotix inc a usbased manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market for an initial cash payment of 105 million plus additional cash consideration of 10 million that will be paid in the first quarter of 2019 we also recorded a onetime gain of 187 million during 2018 related to the settlement of the biotix acquisition contingent consideration 

in 2018 and 2017 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 55 million and 21 million  respectively 

 38 

as previously described we recorded charges of 36 million and 72 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively for the estimated income tax effects of the transition tax associated with the tax cuts and jobs act of which 62 million is expected to be paid over a period of up to eight years we also plan to continue to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested we believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes 

as further described in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements we have the following senior notes 

in 2012  we issued and sold 50 million  of 367  senior notes due december 17 2022  in a private placement the 367 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest is payable semiannually in june and december 

in 2013 we issued and sold 50 million of 410  senior notes due september 19 2023  in a private placement the 410  senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest on the 410  senior notes is payable semiannually in march and september of each year

in 2015  we issued in a private placement euro 125 million  fifteenyear senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 147   147  euro senior notes the euro senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company we have designated the 147  euro senior notes as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in a eurodenominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency translation risk associated with this net investment changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income loss we recorded in other comprehensive income loss related to this net investment hedge an unrealized gain of 67 million  and an unrealized loss of 182 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

credit agreement 

in 2018 we entered into an amended 11 billion  credit agreement the credit agreement which amended our 800 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of june 15 2023  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2018  set at libor plus 875  basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio as of december 31 2018  approximately 6007 million  was available under the facility 

 39 

other local arrangements 

in april 2018 two of our nonus pension plans issued loans totaling 396 million swiss franc 38 million to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of swiss franc libor plus 875 basis points a maturity date of april 2019 and a one year mutual renewal term and as such are classified as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet the proceeds were used to repay outstanding amounts on the companys credit facility 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2018  



1 see note 6 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the credit agreement 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

 40 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect our results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

in november 2018 the companys board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion  to the share repurchase program which has 21 billion of remaining availability as of december 31 2018 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities borrowings and cash balances repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 275 million  common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2018  at a total cost of 44 billion  during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  we spent 475 million  and 400 million  on the repurchase of 802809 shares and 749254 shares at an average price per share of 59165  and 53384  respectively we reissued 183379  shares and 270413  shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2018  and 2017  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc 

 41 

strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million  to 18 million  annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 15 million  to 17 million  annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2018  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 301 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed 

 42 

of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 05 million  at december 31 2018  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2018  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 40 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 41 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2018  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

we also entered into a cross currency swap in 2017 the fair value of this contract was a net asset of 11 million at december 31 2018  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2018  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 15 million conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a 15 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2018  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 

 43 

assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2018  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  were 42 million  and 1302 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2018  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  were 77 million  and 8641 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2018  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 16 million  and 22 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2018  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 65  for the us plan and 38  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 68 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2018  the weighted average discount rate assumption was 41  for the us plan and 12  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 70 million after tax 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 44 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2018  trade accounts receivable were 5355 million  net of a 155 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2018  inventories were 2688 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2018  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5348 million  and other intangible assets of 2173 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

if we are unable to conclude whether the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may 

 45 

experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be nonus withholding taxes certain state taxes and us taxes on currency gains if any all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 6519 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  each increase of 65 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product we consider control to have transferred based upon shipping terms to the extent that our contracts have a separate performance obligation revenue related to any postshipment performance obligation is deferred until completed shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the end customer revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective except for rebate programs rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits the provisions for estimated returns and rebates are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 

certain of our product arrangements include separate performance obligations primarily related to installation such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have standalone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within our control the allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable 

 46 

standalone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a few small software applications we generally do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is usually embedded in the product our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed revenue from spare parts sold on a standalone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a timebased method these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

 9 

employees 

our total workforce was 15400  throughout the world including 13800 employees and 1600  temporary personnel as of december 31 2017  and includes approximately 5600  in europe 4700  in north and south america and 5100  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a substantial number of our employees approximately 600  employees in germany and france are represented by unions 

sustainability 

sustainability touches all aspects of our business from designing and producing our products to selling and delivering them to our customers to handling them at the end of their lifecycle sustainability helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers employees suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate our business we want to manage our business sustainably to position the company for longterm growth our greenmt program is designed to help save energy and resources we do this in four key areas 1 developing products using our design for environment criteria that allow us and our customers to reduce energy usage material and product waste 2 energy efficiency projects to reduce energy usage at our sites 3 managing our sales and service fleets to reduce our fuel consumption and 4 reducing the environmental impact of our resource consumption especially in processes related to cooling and packaging our goal is to reduce our carbon footprint by the end of 2020 by 20 relative co2 emissions per net sales compared with 2010 and at the same time realize financial benefits 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses an enterprise architecture with a global singleinstance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese uk benelux and certain us and german operations we estimate that we have approximately 75 of the program completed as measured in users we will continue to implement the program in additional locations over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland the european union germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 10 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging 

 11 

markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations accounted for 17  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 35  of total segment profit during 2017  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets especially china can be volatile while we experienced strong growth in china in 2017 we have also experienced sales declines in recent years and we may see volatility in the future 

 14 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business in addition if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 10 million  to 12 million  annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2017  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 259 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

 15 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist or hacker attacks malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses ransomware and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition our business interruption and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges security failures in our products cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese uk benelux and certain us and german operations we estimate that we have approximately 75 of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

 16 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes hurricanes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine 

 17 

their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

 18 

a terrorism attack other geopolitical crisis or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters also in past years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu and more recently ebola outbreaks in parts of africa despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such events businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work these events particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor 

 19 

obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we have implemented may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regards to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cant satisfy customers demands we may lose business and if we cant meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

 20 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations changes in political policy in the united states and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability changes in political policy in the united states and certain european countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty recently the united states government formally withdrew from the transpacific partnership agreement initiated renegotiations of the north american free trade agreement and threatened tougher trade terms with china and other countries these actions may restrict our access to lower cost countries cause foreign governments to consider tougher trade terms for us companies or otherwise create uncertainty in global markets in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5398 million  and other intangible assets of 2267 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 21 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2017  we had total indebtedness of approximately 8312 million  net of cash of 1487 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 800 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 13  financial institutions which individually have between 2  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2017  we had borrowings of 4619 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 800 million  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not 

 22 

rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash 

 23 

in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 9  in 2017  and 5  in 2016  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 8  in 2017  and increased 7  in 2016  net sales growth in local currencies during 2017 reflected broadbased growth across most geographies and product categories as a result of favorable global market conditions and strong execution of our growth initiatives we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes while global market conditions are currently favorable we will face challenging prior period comparisons in 2018 due to strong results in 2017 economic conditions can also change quickly particularly in emerging markets and it is uncertain that favorable market conditions will continue 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2017  versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was generally favorable during 2017  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2017  was driven by strong growth in most product categories 

our industrial markets continued to benefit from our customers focus on brand protection and food safety within our product inspection endmarket we also experienced improved market conditions in china with core industrial customers catching up on their product replacement cycles emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries our industrialrelated products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

 31 

our food retailing sales declined during 2017  due to reduced investment by retailers for our type of products traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations 

in 2018  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy for example over the past few years we have added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will look to continue to make investments to frontend resources in 2018 we also aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include leveraging big data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage big data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or selling new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 34  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have approximately a 30year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 13  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and benefit as multinational customers shift production to china india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall market conditions in emerging markets were favorable during 2017  we experienced a 12  increase in emerging market local currency sales during 2017  versus the prior year which included 19 local currency sales growth in china within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food safety and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our laboratory process analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets however emerging market sales can be volatile chinas credit availability can also be particularly volatile and certain industrialrelated enduser segments still have overcapacity 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to accelerate product replacement cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

expanding our margins we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services and optimizing our cost structure for example sophisticated data analytic tools 

 32 

provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes we also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years in response to changing market conditions as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs and have further increased our focus on these programs during the past year with the global launch of our sterndrive initiative sterndrive is our global program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain manufacturing and backoffice operations blue ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives our move to standardized business processes systems and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to realtime data our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions for example during the third quarter of 2017 we acquired the shares of biotix inc a manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market based in the united states for an initial cash payment of 105 million we also may be required to pay additional cash consideration up to a maximum amount of 65 million of which we recorded an estimated 307 million as of december 31 2017 during 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of henry troemner llc troemner a supplier of lab equipment weights and weight calibration based in the united states for an aggregate purchase price of 958 million that has been integrated into our laboratory product offering 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 27 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 25 billion  in 2016  and 24 billion  in 2015  this represents an increase of 9  in 2017  and an increase of 5  in 2016  in us dollars and an increase of 8  and 7  in local currencies respectively the biotix and troemner acquisitions contributed 1 to our net sales in 2017 global market conditions were favorable during 2017 and we continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs and development of our robust product portfolio however we will face difficult prior period comparisons in 2018 due to strong results in 2017 economic conditions can also change quickly especially in emerging markets and its uncertain that favorable market conditions will continue 

in 2017  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars 8  in the americas 6  in europe and 11  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2017  by 8  in the americas 5  in europe and 11  in asiarest of world the biotix and troemner acquisitions contributed approximately 2  to net sales in the americas during 2017 in addition our food retailing sales declined in 2017 due to reduced investment by retailers for our type of products in the americas which decreased local currency sales in the americas by 3 a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

as described in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

 33 

net sales of products increased 9  in us dollars and in local currencies during 2017  and increased 5  in us dollars and 7  in local currencies in 2016  the biotix and troemner acquisitions contributed approximately 2  to our net sales of products during 2017 service revenue including spare parts increased 7  in us dollars and in local currencies in 2017  and increased 4  in us dollars and 6  in local currencies in 2016  the troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1  to our net sales of service during 2017 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products and services which represented approximately 50  of our total net sales in 2017  increased 11  in us dollars and 10  in local currencies during 2017  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2017  includes strong growth in most product categories particularly analytical instruments the biotix and troemner acquisitions also contributed approximately 2  to our net sales growth of laboratoryrelated products and services 

net sales of our industrialrelated products and services which represented approximately 42  of our total net sales in 2017  increased 8  in us dollars and 8  in local currencies during 2017  in 2017 we experienced strong growth in product inspection and core industrial our coreindustrial results include very strong results in china 

net sales of our food retailing products and services which represented approximately 8  of our total net sales in 2017  decreased 3  in us dollars and 4  in local currencies during 2017  the decline in net sales of our food retailing products is due to a decrease in the americas driven by reduced investment by these retailers for our type of products 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 577  for 2017  compared to 572  for 2016  and 564  for 2015

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2017  includes favorable price realization offset in part by unfavorable business mix changes in foreign currency and increased material costs 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 47  for 2017  48 for 2016  and   50  for 2015  research and development expenses in us dollars increased 8  in 2017  and 1  in 2016  and in local currencies increased 8  in 2017  and 4  in 2016  relating to increased investments in new product development

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 427 million  in 2017  compared to 361 million  and 310 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including the companys blue ocean program as well as the biotix and troemner acquisitions 

 34 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated various cost reduction measures for the year ended december 31 2017  we have incurred 128 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 14 and note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2017

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 328 million  for 2017  compared to 280 million  for 2016  and 275 million  for   2015  

our annual effective tax rate was 22  for 2017  and 24 for both 2016  and 2015  excluding onetime charges in 2017 associated with the tax cuts and job act described below the reduction in our annual effective tax rate from 24 in 2016 and 2015 to 22 in 2017 is primarily related to our adoption of asu 201609 pertaining to excess tax benefits in the current year associated with stock option exercises as discussed in note 2 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the act significantly revised us corporate income tax law the act includes among other things a reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and the implementation of a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax that is payable over a period of up to eight years the tax effects of the act are reflected in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017

our accounting for the above items is based upon reasonable estimates of the tax effects of the act however our estimates may change upon the finalization of our implementation and additional interpretive guidance from regulatory authorities we will complete our accounting for the above tax effects of the act during 2018 as provided in staff accounting bulletin 118 and will reflect any adjustments to our provisional amounts as an adjustment to the provision for taxes in the reporting period in which the amounts are finally determined 

additionally certain provisions of the act are not effective until 2018 we are in the process of evaluating the impact of these provisions and have not yet recorded any impact in the financial statements nor have we made any accounting policy elections with respect to these items

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in both total net sales and net sales to external customers of 9 in 2017  includes strong growth in product inspection and laboratoryrelated products offset in part by a significant decline in food retailing which reduced net sales to external customers by 3 during 2017 net sales to external customers in our us operations during 2017 also benefited approximately 3  from the biotix and troemner acquisitions 

segment profit increased 162 million  in our us operations segment during 2017  compared to an increase of 140 million  during 2016  our segment profit includes the impact of increased net sales and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives offset in part by increased sales service and research and development investments as well as higher cash incentive and employee benefit costs

segment profit increased 439 million  in our chinese operations segment during 2017  compared to an increase of 224 million  in 2016  the increase in segment profit during 2017 includes increased local currency net sales volume benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives and intersegment transfers

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions can be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 5163 million  in 2017  compared to 4608 million  in 2016  and 4398 million  in 2015  the increase in 2017  is primarily related to higher net earnings 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 1274 million  in 2017  1240 million  in 2016  and 825 million  in 2015  cash flow from investing activities in 2017 also includes proceeds of 99 million relating to the sale of a facility in switzerland in connection with our initiative to consolidate certain swiss operations into a new facility we expect to make net investments in new or expanded manufacturing facilities of 40 million to 50 million over the next two years the 2016 amount also includes a 37 million purchase of our previously leased pipette manufacturing facility 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2017  included share repurchases as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 749254 shares and 1348507 shares in the amount of 400 million  and 500 million  during 2017  and 2016  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness as further described in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 we acquired all of the shares of biotix inc a manufacturer and distributor of plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life sciences market based in the united states for an initial cash payment of 105 million we may also be required to pay additional cash consideration up to a maximum amount of 65 million of which we recorded an estimated 307 million as of december 31 2017 during 2016 we also acquired substantially all of the assets of henry troemner llc troemner a supplier of lab equipment weights and weight calibration based in the united states for an aggregate purchase price of 958 million that will be integrated into our laboratory product offering 

 38 

in 2017 and 2016 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 21 million and 156 million  respectively 

as previously described we have recorded a provisional onetime charge of 72 million for the estimated income tax effects of the transition tax associated with the tax cuts and jobs act of which 59 million is expected to be paid over a period of up to eight years we also plan to continue to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested we believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes 

as further described in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements we have the following senior notes 

in 2012  we issued and sold 50 million  of 367  senior notes due december 17 2022  in a private placement the 367 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest is payable semiannually in june and december

in 2015  we issued in a private placement euro 125 million  fifteenyear senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 147   147  euro senior notes the euro senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company we have designated the 147  euro senior notes as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in a eurodenominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency translation risk associated with this net investment changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income loss we recorded in other comprehensive income loss related to this net investment hedge an unrealized loss of 182 million  and an unrealized gain of 51 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

credit agreement 

in 2015 we entered into an 800 million  amended credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 800 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of december 17 2020  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2017  set at libor plus 975 basis points 

 39 

we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio as of december 31 2017  approximately 3326 million  was available under the facility 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2017  



1 see note 5 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the credit agreement 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to 

 40 

materially affect our results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

we have a share repurchase program of which there were 5834 million  common shares remaining to be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2017  the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 267 million  common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2017  at a total cost of 39 billion  during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  we spent 400 million  and 500 million  on the repurchase of 749254 shares and 1348507 shares at an average price per share of 53384  and 37075  respectively we reissued 270413  shares and 278623  shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2017  and 2016  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 16 million to 18 million annually 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 10 million  to 12 million  annually 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2017  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 259 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

 41 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on 

 42 

our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 13 million  at december 31 2017  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2017  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 54 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 56 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2017  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

we also entered into a cross currency swap in 2017 the fair value of this contract was a net loss of 01 million at december 31 2017  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2017  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 25 million conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a 15 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2017  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2017  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  were 48 million  and 1426 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2017  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  were 108 million  and 9185 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2017  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 26 million  and 27 million  respectively 

 43 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2017  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 650  for the us plan and 386  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 64 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2017  the weighted average discount rate assumption was 35  for the us plan and 10  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 110 million after tax 

in early 2016 in order to reduce the size and potential volatility of our us defined benefit pension plan obligation we offered approximately 700 former employees who had deferred vested pension plan benefits a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits based upon the eligible participant acceptance 146 million was paid from plan assets to these former employees in the second quarter of 2016 with a corresponding decrease in the benefit obligation the company incurred a onetime noncash settlement charge recorded in other charges income net during the second quarter of 2016 of approximately 82 million of which 80 million 49 million after tax was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2017  trade accounts receivable were 5286 million  net of a 155 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2017  inventories were 2554 million  

 44 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 5398 million  and other intangible assets of 2267 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

if we are unable to conclude whether the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 45 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany luxembourg the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 5742 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  each increase of 57 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfer upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a significant postshipment obligation revenue is deferred on the undelivered element until the obligation has been completed we also sometimes enter into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within our control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

 46 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which are generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period

product inspection 

increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated endofline product inspection systems eg for use in food processing and packaging pharmaceutical and other industries we are a leading global provider of metal detectors xray and camerabased visioning equipment checkweighers and trackandtrace solutions that are used in these industries metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection is used to detect metallic contamination in metallized packaging and many types of nonmetallic contamination such as glass calcified bone stones and pits our xray systems can be used for mass control and for determining and controlling the fat content in meat our camerabased vision inspection solutions provide inline inspection of package quality labels and content which are needs for food and beverage consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies vision inspection systems with associated specialist software enable our pharmaceutical customers to implement traceability and serialization tracking as required by regulation checkweighers are used to control the filled weight of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics all of our technologies are integrated with material handling systems to ensure the correct presentation of the customer’s product to the device and the secure rejection of nonconforming product our technologies may also be used together as components of integrated packaging lines prodx inspect is our quality and productivity control software for helping customers comply with regulations and optimize process efficiency either as a standalone solution or through integration with the customer’s manufacturing and enterprise systems 

retail weighing solutions 

supermarkets hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods such as meats vegetables fruits or cheeses we offer networked scales and software which can integrate backroom counter selfservice and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system the scale screen display allows for instore marketing and can help encourage consumers in the store to make more purchase decisions at the point of sale in addition we offer standalone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing the customer benefits of our retail solutions are in the areas of enterprisewide article and price management merchandising and regulatory compliance in north america and select other markets our offering also includes automated packaging and labeling solutions for the meat backroom which are fully integrated with the scales in the store the retail business accounted for approximately 9  of our net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  

customers and distribution 

our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food and beverage producers food retailers chemical specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic community 

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohausbranded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service

we have a diversified customer base with no single endcustomer accounting for more than 1  of 2016 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against at december 31 2016  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 7200 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 39  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services as well as further expansion of our offerings to provide valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance performance enhancements application expertise and training and remote services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with fda and other international regulations and we can provide these services to most customers locations around the world our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts on demand services and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22  of our net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  a portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 8 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 362 million  in research and development  1200 million  in 2016  1191 million  in 2015  and 1233 million  in 2014  which is approximately 5  of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1300 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany and the united kingdom we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand we expect to make net investments in new or expanded manufacturing facilities of 65 million to 75 million over the next two years 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

 9 

employees 

our total workforce was 14200  throughout the world including employees and 1000  of temporary personnel as of december 31 2016  and includes approximately 5500  in europe 3800  in north and south america and 4900  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a substantial number of our employees approximately 600  employees in germany and france are represented by unions 

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders in 2016 we published our latest sustainability report which measures progress and highlights accomplishments since our last report we followed the global reporting initiative g4 guidelines our greenmt program is designed to help save energy and resources and at the same time realize financial benefits we are now working on making regular reductions in our emissions by finding new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese uk and certain us and german operations we estimate that we have approximately twothirds of the program completed as measured in users we will continue to implement the program in additional locations over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and 

 10 

measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant 

 11 

global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 15  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 32  of total segment profit during 2016  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 

including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia may affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

growth in emerging markets can be volatile for example during 2015 china russia and brazil accounted for 18 of our sales to external customers and declined 11 in local currencies as customer investments slowed due to a variety of economic factors china our largest emerging market country had improved market conditions in 2016 but market uncertainties remain due to overcapacity in certain industries and ongoing volatility in credit availability 

 13 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business in addition if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

in january 2015 the swiss national bank abandoned its exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro the swiss national banks abandonment of the euro exchange rate floor resulted in an immediate strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar excluding the effects of any foreign currency hedging contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 15 million  to 17 million  annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 02 million  annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 04 million  to 06 million  annually 

in 2016 the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world the strength of the us dollar may have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the future 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2016  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against 

 14 

the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 230 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist or hacker attacks malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses ransomware and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges security failures in our products cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese uk and certain us and german operations we estimate that we have approximately twothirds of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we 

 15 

have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and 

 16 

support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends earnings or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could materially 

 17 

impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

a terrorism attack other geopolitical crisis or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters also in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu and more recently ebola outbreaks in parts of africa despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such events businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work these events particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor 

 18 

obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

the sec has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we have implemented may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may not be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regards to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cant satisfy customers demands we may lose business and if we cant meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

 19 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations changes in political leadership in the united states and certain european countries may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability changes in political leadership in the united states and certain european countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty in times of uncertainty some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles which could have an adverse impact on our sales 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2016  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4764 million  and other intangible assets of 1671 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2016  we had total indebtedness of approximately 7354 million  net of cash of 1587 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

 20 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 800 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 13  financial institutions which individually have between 2  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2016  we had borrowings of 3952 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 800 million  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking 

 21 

statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single endcustomer accounts for more than 1  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 22 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

we also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified although the impact of such factors is not considered material we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased 5  in 2016  and decreased 4  in 2015  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 7  in 2016  and increased 3  in 2015  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted net sales as most of our nonus dollar trading currencies especially the euro have weakened against the us dollar net sales growth in local currencies during 2016 reflected broadbased growth across most geographies and product categories with generally favorable global market conditions we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities more effectively pricing our products and services increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes while market conditions were generally stable in 2016 for our customers to maintain their replacement cycles we remain cautious regarding our sales outlook given the uncertainty in global markets 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2016  versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was generally favorable during 2016  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2016  was driven by strong growth in most product categories especially pipettes and automated chemistry 

our industrial markets continued to benefit from our customers focus on brand protection and food safety within our product inspection endmarket we also experienced improved market conditions in china despite continued market uncertainty related to overcapacity in a number of industries and volatility in credit availability emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have 

 29 

moved production to lowcost countries our industrialrelated products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets experienced growth in each geographic region during 2016  with strong growth in europe and asiarest of world traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2017  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy for example over the past two years we have added more than 450 field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will look to continue to make investments to frontend resources in 2017 we also aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include leveraging big data analytics to identify prioritize and pursue growth opportunities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force guidance training and effectiveness crossselling increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to leverage big data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or selling new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 33  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have almost a 30year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 13  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and benefit as multinational customers shift production to china india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall market conditions in emerging markets were generally favorable during 2016  we experienced a 9  increase in emerging market local currency sales during 2016  versus the prior year which included 9 local currency sales growth in china emerging market sales can be volatile and uncertain we continue to experience unfavorable market conditions and reduced demand in certain industrialrelated enduser segments in china due to overcapacity within china we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food safety and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our laboratory process analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments we also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in underpenetrated emerging markets 

 30 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we have focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years in response to changing market conditions as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue bolton acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions for example during the third quarter of 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of henry troemner llc troemner a supplier of lab equipment weights and weight calibration based in the united states for an aggregate purchase price 958 million that will be integrated into our laboratory product offering during the third quarter of 2015 we also acquired a realtime water purity technology in the united states that has been integrated into our process analytics product offering 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 25083 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 23954 million  in 2015  and 24860 million  in 2014  this represents an increase of 5  in 2016  and a decrease of 4  in 2015  in us dollars and an increase of 7  and 3  in local currencies respectively the troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1  to our net sales during 2016

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2016  includes benefits from higher sales volume favorable price realization and reduced material costs partially offset by investments in our field service organization 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 48  for 2016  and 50  for both 2015  and 2014  research and development expenses in us dollars increased 1  in 2016  and decreased 3  in 2015  and in local currencies increased 4  in 2016  and 2  in 2015  relating to the timing of research and development project activity

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 361 million  in 2016  compared to 310 million  and 292 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including the companys blue ocean program as well as the troemner acquisition 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions for the year ended december 31 2016  we have incurred 62 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2016

our annual effective tax rate was 24  for 2016  2015  and 2014  our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers of 5 in 2016  reflects solid sales growth in most product categories against difficult comparisons in the previous year net sales in our us operations also benefited approximately 1  from the troemner acquisition during 2016 

segment profit increased 140 million  in our us operations segment during 2016  compared to an increase of 242 million  during 2015  the increase in segment profit during 2016  is primarily related to increased sales and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives offset in part by increased cash incentive expense and sales and service investments

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions are uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global market conditions 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 4431 million  in 2016  compared to 4269 million  in 2015  and 4189 million  in 2014  the increase in 2016  includes higher net earnings partly offset by increased working capital that is primarily related to our increased local currency sales 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 1240 million  in 2016  825 million  in 2015  and 894 million  in 2014  the 2016 amount includes a 37 million purchase of our previously leased pipette manufacturing facility we also expect to make net investments in new or expanded manufacturing facilities of 65 million to 75 million over the next two years 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2016  included share repurchases as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1348507 shares and 1556797 shares in the amount of 500 million  and 495 million  during 2016  and 2015  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness as further described in note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2016 we acquired substantially all of the assets of henry troemner llc troemner a supplier of lab equipment weights and weight calibration based in the united states for an aggregate purchase price of 958 million  that will be included into our laboratory instrument offering 

in 2016 we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling 156 million  

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany luxembourg the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2016  we had an immaterial amount of cash 

 35 

and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

senior notes 

as further described in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements we have the following senior notes 

in 2012  we issued and sold 50 million  of 367  senior notes due december 17 2022  in a private placement the 367 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest is payable semiannually in june and december 

in 2013 we issued and sold 50 million of 410  senior notes due september 19 2023  in a private placement the 410  senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest on the 410  senior notes is payable semiannually in march and september of each year beginning in march 2014 

in 2014 we entered into an agreement to issue and sell 250 million  of tenyear senior notes in a private placement we issued 125 million  with a fixed interest rate of 384   384  senior notes in september 2014 and issued 125 million  with a fixed interest rate of 424   424  senior notes in june 2015 the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest on the 384  senior notes is payable semiannually in march and september each year beginning in march 2015 interest on the 424  senior notes is payable semiannually in june and december each year beginning in december 2015 the 424 senior notes were used to repay 100 million of 630 senior notes which were due june 25 2015 

in 2015  we issued in a private placement euro 125 million  fifteenyear senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 147   147  euro senior notes the euro senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company we have designated the 147  euro senior notes as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in a euro denominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency translation risk associated with this net investment changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income loss we recorded an unrealized gain in other comprehensive income loss related to this net investment hedge of 51 million  and 36 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

credit agreement 

in 2015 we entered into an 800 million  amended credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 800 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of december 17 2020  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2016  set at libor plus 875 basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio as of december 31 2016  approximately 3996 million  was available under the facility 

 36 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2016  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect our results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 37 

share repurchase program 

we have a share repurchase program of which there was 9834 million  common shares remaining to be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2016  the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 260 million  common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2016  at a total cost of 35 billion  during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we spent 500 million  and 495 million  on the repurchase of 1348507 shares and 1556797 shares at an average price per share of 37075  and 31792  respectively we reissued 278623  shares and 403908  shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2016  and 2015  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro through 2016 absent these foreign currency forward contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 15 million  to 17 million  annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 02 million  annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 04 million  to 06 million  annually 

over the past two years the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world the strength of the us dollar may have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the future 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2016  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the 

 38 

currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 230 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as changes in law the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover 

 39 

increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe india and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china eastern europe india and brazil increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales and to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of the foreign currency contracts hedging shortterm intercompany balances was a 13 million  net liability at december 31 2016  a sensitivity analysis to changes on the foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and the euro declined by 10  the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments would increase by 02 million  at december 31 2016  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying economic position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 36 million  at december 31 2016  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2016  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 67 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 70 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2016  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 40 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2016  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  were 126 million  and 1382 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2016  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  were 72 million  and 8383 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2016  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 45 million  and 30 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2016  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 675  for the us plan and 41  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 63 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2016  the average discount rate assumption was 40  for the us plan and 10  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 116 million after tax 

in early 2016 in order to reduce the size and potential volatility of our us defined benefit pension plan obligation we offered approximately 700 former employees who have deferred vested pension plan benefits a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits based upon the eligible participant acceptance 146 million was paid from plan assets to these former employees in the second quarter of 2016 with a corresponding decrease in the benefit obligation the company incurred a onetime noncash settlement charge recorded in other charges income net during the second quarter of 2016 of approximately 82 million of which 80 million 49 million after tax was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 41 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2016  trade accounts receivable were 4550 million  net of a 142 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2016  inventories were 2220 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2016  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4764 million  and other intangible assets of 1671 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude that the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

if we are unable to conclude that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may 

 42 

experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany luxembourg the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 5042 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  each increase of 50 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a significant postshipment obligation revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the 

 43 

relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period

 7 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1  of 2015 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against at december 31 2015  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 6800 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 39  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services as well as further expansion of our offerings to provide valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance performance enhancements application expertise and training and remote services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with fda and other international regulations and we can provide these services to most customers locations around the world our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts on demand services and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22  of our net sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 8 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested almost 360 million  in research and development  1191 million  in 2015  1233 million  in 2014  and 1163 million  in 2013  which is approximately 5  of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1300 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany and the united kingdom we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand we expect to make increased investments in manufacturing facilities of 80 million to 90 million over the next two years 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

 9 

employees 

our total workforce was 13500  throughout the world including employees and 1000  of temporary personnel as of december 31 2015  and includes approximately 5100  in europe 3600  in north and south america and 4800  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a substantial number of our employees  approximately   600   employees in germany and france are represented by unions   

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders in 2014 we published our latest sustainability report which measures progress and highlights accomplishments since our last report we followed the global reporting initiative g4 guidelines our greenmt program is designed to help save energy and resources and at the same time realize financial benefits we are now working on making significant reductions in our emissions by finding new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese and certain us german and uk operations and have approximately twothirds of the program completed as measured in users we will continue to implement the program in additional locations over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 5000  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our 

 10 

markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 11 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 16  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 29  of total segment profit during 2015  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 

including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in russia sanctions imposed on business in russia will likely continue to affect the economy and our business in russia in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

during 2015 china russia and brazil accounted for 18 of our sales to external customers and declined 11 in local currencies as customer investments have slowed due to a variety of economic factors in particular chinese market conditions continue to reflect overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers the timing of a market stabilization or recovery in china russia and brazil remains uncertain growth in other emerging markets can also be expected to be volatile 

 14 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries an economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business in addition if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro which was abandoned in january 2015 the swiss national banks abandonment of the euro exchange rate floor resulted in an immediate strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar excluding the effects of any foreign currency hedging contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 12 million  to 14 million  annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 04 million  to 06 million  annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 03 million  to 05 million  annually 

in 2015 the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world the strength of the us dollar may have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the future 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and euro based on 

 15 

our outstanding debt at december 31 2015  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 192 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

concerns regarding the eurozone debt levels and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist or hacker attacks malicious employees or employee negligence computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

customers may use our products to generate or manage confidential information though we take steps to ensure our products are secure it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products if a customer alleges security failures in our products cause or contribute to a loss we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese and certain us german and u k operations and have approximately twothirds of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer 

 16 

to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own there has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to 

 17 

make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years recently there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could materially 

 18 

impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue terrorism attack or other geopolitical crisis could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu and more recently ebola outbreaks in parts of africa despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks also our global operations are susceptible to global events including natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and threats to political stability as a result of such events businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work these events particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection may expire and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed we may experience a decline in sales andor profitability if any of these things occur competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor 

 19 

obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

key employees could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain including conflict minerals 

in august 2012 the sec adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may not be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

future laws regulations or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency these demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regards to human rights and sustainable sourcing we have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs if we cant satisfy customers demands we may lose business and if we cant meet new regulatory requirements we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products including design and development product safety labeling 

 20 

manufacturing promotion sales and distribution we also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets we do business including those relating to competition employment and labor practices international trade and corruption if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to investigation costs reputational harm fines criminal prosecution and other damages that could impact our profitability 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2015  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4463 million  and other intangible assets of 1153 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2015  we had total indebtedness of approximately 4926 million  net of cash of 989 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

 21 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 800 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 13  financial institutions which individually have between 2  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2015  we had borrowings of 904 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 800 million  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

  22 

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single customer accounts for more than 1  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory governmental and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows changes in governmental cash repatriation policies restrictions or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars decreased 4  in 2015  and increased 4  in 2014  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 3  in 2015  and 5  in 2014  net sales growth during 2015 reflected favorable market conditions in our western markets particularly the united states and our ability to pursue underpenetrated markets offset in part by reduced market demand in china russia and brazil we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes and more effectively pricing our products and services currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted net sales as most of our nonus dollar trading currencies especially the euro have weakened against the us dollar while market conditions remain stable in most parts of the world we continue to see unfavorable market conditions in china russia and brazil where customer investments have slowed due to a variety of economic factors we remain cautious about our sales outlook as the timing of a market stabilization or recovery in these three countries remains uncertain 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2015  versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was generally strong during 2015  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2015 was driven by strong volume and favorable price realization in most product categories including particularly strong growth in automated chemistry and pipettes these results were offset in part by significant sales volume declines in brazil and russia 

our industrial markets experienced favorable market conditions in the united states and benefited from our customers focus on brand protection and food safety within our product inspection endmarket but were adversely impacted in 2015 by a significant decline in our industrialrelated sales in china russia and brazil due to reduced market demand related to a variety of economic conditions emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their 

 29 

domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries our industrialrelated products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets experienced modest growth during 2015  primarily driven by strong project activity in the united states offset in part by reduced sales in europe traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2016  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy for example we added more than 200 field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will look to make similar investments to frontend resources in 2016 we also aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs leveraging our extensive customer databases and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness crossselling and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract or selling new products that replace old products in our installed base in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 33  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 25year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 14  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and benefit as multinational customers shift production to china india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall market conditions in emerging markets were mixed during 2015  and below our longterm expectations we experienced a 2  decrease in emerging market local currency sales during 2015  versus the prior year due to unfavorable market conditions in china russia and brazil chinese market conditions for our industrial products were particularly weak in 2015  related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers we also experienced significant sales declines in russia and brazil due to reduced market demand during 2015 china russia and brazil represented 18 of our global sales to external customers and experienced a decline in sales of 11 in local currencies while sales in our other emerging markets increased 10 in local currencies emerging market sales can be expected to be volatile and the timing of a market stabilization or recovery in china russia and brazil remains uncertain within china we are redeploying resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food safety and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our 

 30 

laboratory process analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we have focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years in response to changing market conditions as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired a realtime water purity technology in the united states that has been integrated into our process analytics product offering 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 23954 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 24860 million  in 2014  and 23790 million  in 2013  this represents a decrease of 4  in 2015  and an increase of 4  in 2014  in us dollars and an increase of 3  and 5  in local currencies respectively 

in 2015  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars 6  in the americas decreased 12  in europe and decreased 5  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2015  by 8  in the americas and 2  in europe and was flat in asiarest of world net sales were impacted by significant sales declines in china russia and brazil a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

as described in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products decreased 3  in us dollars and increased 3  in local currencies during 2015  and increased 4  in both us dollars and local currencies in 2014  service revenue including spare parts decreased 5  in us dollars and increased 4  in local currencies in 2015  and increased 7  in us dollars and 8  in local currencies in 2014  

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products which represented approximately 48  of our total net sales in 2015  decreased 1  in us dollars and increased 7  in local currencies during 2015  the local currency increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products during 2015 was driven by strong volume 

 31 

and favorable price realization in most product categories including particularly strong growth in automated chemistry and pipettes these results were offset in part by significant sales volume declines in brazil and russia 

net sales of our industrialrelated products which represented approximately 43  of our total net sales in 2015  decreased 7  in us dollars and were flat in local currencies during 2015  local currency net sales included significant sales volume declines of industrialrelated products in china russia and brazil offset by strong growth in the united states primarily due to increased volume and favorable price realization across most product categories 

net sales of our food retailing products which represented approximately 9  of our total net sales in 2015  decreased 5  in us dollars and increased 2  in local currencies during 2015  the increase in net sales in local currencies of our food retailing products during 2015 was driven by strong project activity in the americas offset in part by reduced net sales in europe 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 564  for 2015  compared to 547  for 2014  and 539  for 2013  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 601  for 2015  compared to 581  for 2014  and 573  for 2013  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 436  for 2015  compared to 428  for 2014  and 417  for 2013  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2015  includes the benefit of hedging gains and currency translation favorable price realization reduced material costs and improved labor efficiency offset in part by investments in our field service organization 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 50  for both 2015  and 2014  and 49  for 2013  research and development expenses in us dollars decreased 3  in 2015  and increased 6  in 2014  and in local currencies increased 2  in 2015  and increased 5  in 2014  relating to the timing of research and development project activity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 293  for both 2015  and 2014  compared to 291  for 2013  selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4  in 2015  in us dollars and increased 3  in local currencies and increased 5  in both us dollars and local currencies in 2014  the increase during 2015 includes additional investments in our field sales organization and higher employee benefit costs offset in part by lower cash incentive expense and benefits from our cost savings programs 

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 310 million  in 2015 compared to 292 million   and 245 million  in 2014  and 2013 respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to our investments in information technology including the companys blue ocean program 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated additional cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions for the year ended december 31 2015  we have incurred 111 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2015  

 32 

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net income of 09 million  in 2015  compared to net charges of 22 million  and 31 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively other charges income net consists primarily of gains losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activity interest income and other items 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 275 million  for 2015  compared to 245 million  for 2014  and 227 million  for   2013  

our annual effective tax rate was 24  for 2015  2014  and 2013  our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers in 2015  reflects strong growth in most product categories 

segment profit increased 243 million  in our us operations segment during 2015  compared to a decrease of 33 million  during 2014  the increase in segment profit during 2015 is primarily related to increased sales and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives and cost savings programs offset in part by increased sales and service investments

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions global market conditions are uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global market conditions 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 4269 million  in 2015  compared to 4189 million  in 2014  and 3459 million  in 2013  the increase in 2015  includes higher net earnings voluntary pension payments of 18 million in the prior year and increased customer deposits offset in part by increased cash incentive payments of 14 million and higher inventory levels 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 825 million  in 2015  894 million  in 2014  and 823 million  in 2013  we expect to make increased investments in manufacturing facilities of 80 million to 90 million over the next two years 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2015  included proceeds from the issuance of our 125 million   424  senior notes and euro 125 million   147  euro senior notes offset by the payment of our 100 million 630 senior notes as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1556797 shares and 1617499 shares in the amount of 4950 million  and 4140 million  during 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in september 2015 we consummated acquisitions totaling 166 million including the acquisition of a realtime monitoring water purity technology for an estimated aggregate purchase price of 147 million that will be integrated into our process analytics product offering we may be required to pay additional cash consideration related to an earnout period goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled 90 million which is included in our us operations segment we also recorded 68 million of identified intangibles primarily pertaining to technology in connection with the acquisitions which will be amortized on a straightline basis over 10 years 

 35 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany luxembourg the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2015  we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity

issuance costs approximating 04 million  are being amortized to interest expense over the fifteen year term of the euro senior notes 

credit agreement 

in 2015 we entered into an 800 million  amended credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 800 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of december 17 2020  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2015  set at libor plus 875 basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in our previously issued debt as described above with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2015  the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default we incurred approximately 01 million  of debt extinguishment costs during 2015 related to the prior credit agreement we capitalized 11 million  in financing fees during 2015 associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through 2020  as of december 31 2015  approximately 7047 million  was available under the facility 

 37 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2015  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2015  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 38 

share repurchase program 

the company has a share repurchase program of which there was 15 billion of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2015 this includes the board of directors authorization of an additional 15 billion to the program in november 2015 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of repurchases will depend on business and market conditions stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 246 million  common shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2015  at a total cost of 30 billion  during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  we spent 4950 million  and 4140 million  on the repurchase of 1556797 shares and 1617499 shares at an average price per share of 31792  and 25593  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro through 2016 the notional amount and average forward rate of our foreign currency forward contracts is euro 665  million and 119  for contracts that mature in 2016 in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro which was abandoned in january 2015 after we entered into the previously mentioned foreign currency forward contracts the swiss national banks abandonment of the euro exchange rate floor resulted in an immediate strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar absent these forward currency forward contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 12 million  to 14 million  annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 04 million  to 06 million  annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 03 million  to 05 million  annually 

 39 

in 2015 the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world the strength of the us dollar may have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the future 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar the swiss franc and the euro based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2015  we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 192 million  in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 40 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china eastern europe and brazil which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales and to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of the foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany sales was a 71 million  asset and the net fair value of the foreign currency contracts hedging shortterm intercompany balances was a 05 million  net asset at december 31 2015  a sensitivity analysis to changes on the foreign forward contracts indicates that if the swiss franc declined by 10  relative to the euro the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges would decrease by  69 million  at december 31 2015  additionally a sensitivity analysis to changes on the foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and the euro declined by 10  the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments would increase by 57 million  at december 31 2015  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying economic position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 41 million  at december 31 2015  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2015  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 71 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 75 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2015  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets 

 41 

income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2015  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  were 53 million  and 1544 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic cost for 2015  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  were 65 million  and 8183 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2015  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 51 million  and 33 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2015  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 725  for the us plan and 46  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 65 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2015  the average discount rate assumption was 43  for the us plan and 13  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 89 million after tax 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 18 million  in 2014  to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plans 

in early 2016 in order to reduce the size and potential volatility of our us defined benefit pension plan obligation we offered approximately 700 former employees who have deferred vested pension plan benefits a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits in early may 2016 the vested benefit obligation associated with these former employees is approximately 32 million equivalent to 21 of the companys benefit obligation for this us plan eligible participants have 45 days to make their election if the percentage of benefits distributed through the lump sum option exceeds 18 of the benefit obligation associated with these former employees we anticipate recognizing a onetime noncash 

 42 

settlement charge of approximately 7 million to 13 million in the second quarter of 2016 the lump sum payments will be funded from existing pension plan assets 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2015  trade accounts receivable were 4114 million  net of a 144 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2015  inventories were 2144 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2015  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4463 million  and other intangible assets of 1153 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is generally based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets and the estimated fair values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets significantly exceed the carrying values 

 43 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 4634 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  each increase of 46 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a significant postshipment obligation revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the 

 44 

deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period

 7 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1 of 2014 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2014 our sales and service group consisted of approximately 6500 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 38  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services as well as further expansion of our offerings to provide valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance performance enhancements application expertise and training and remote services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with fda and other international regulations and we can provide these services to most customers locations around the world our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts on demand services and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22  of our net sales in both 2014 and 2013 and 21 in 2012 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 8 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 3522 million  in research and development  1233 million  in 2014 1163 million in 2013 and 1125 million in 2012 which is approximately 5  of net sales for each year our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1200 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany and the united kingdom we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

 9 

employees 

our total workforce was 13100  throughout the world including employees and 1100 of temporary personnel as of december 31 2014 and includes approximately 5100  in europe 3400  in north and south america and 4600  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees  approximately   600   employees in germany and france are represented by unions   

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders in 2014 we published our latest sustainability report which measures progress and highlights accomplishments since our last report in 2011 we followed the global reporting initiative g4 guidelines our greenmt program is designed to help save energy and resources and at the same time realize financial benefits we are now working on making significant reductions in our emissions by finding new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it encompasses a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese and certain us and german operations and have over half of the program completed as measured in users we will continue to implement the program in additional locations over the coming years 

intellectual property 

we hold over 4900  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our 

 10 

markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 04 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant 

 11 

global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries continued economic uncertainty in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business in addition if developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 17  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 26  of segment profit during 2014  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 

including the following 

  13 

we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item we do business in russia and crimea sanctions imposed on business in these regions will likely affect the economies and our business in these regions in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

current chinese market conditions reflect overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

in january 2015 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro through 2016 the notional amount and average forward rate of our foreign currency forward contracts is euro 86 million and 121 for contracts that mature in 2015 and euro 67 million and 119 for contracts that mature in 2016 respectively in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro which was abandoned in january 2015 after we entered into the previously mentioned foreign currency forward contracts the swiss national banks abandonment of the euro exchange rate floor resulted in an immediate strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar absent these forward currency forward contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 11million to 13 million annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 05 million to 07 million annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 07 million to 09 million annually

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2014 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 23 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

concerns regarding the european debt levels and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist or hacker attacks computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services fraudulent loss of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese and certain us and german operations and have more than half of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

 15 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to maintain these advantages 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 16 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends or capital or on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

 17 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu and more recently ebola outbreaks in parts of africa despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 18 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by regulations relating to conflict minerals 

in august 2012 the sec adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 19 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2014  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4441 million  and other intangible assets of 1128 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2014  we had total indebtedness of approximately 3667 million  net of cash of 853 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

 20 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 800 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 13  financial institutions which individually have between 2  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2014  we had borrowings of 1108 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 800 million  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single customer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

 21 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased by 4  in 2014  and 2  in 2013  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 5  in 2014  and 1  in 2013  net sales growth during 2014 benefited from improved market conditions especially in the united states we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets significant installed base and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes and more effectively pricing our products and services we remain cautious about our sales growth outlook as global market conditions remain uncertain especially in certain emerging markets including china as well as parts of europe 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2014 versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets was generally strong during 2014 we also experienced increased demand from universities and governmentfunded research institutions 

our industrial markets especially product inspection were favorably impacted by our customers focus on brand protection and food safety coreindustrial products also experienced improved market conditions in the americas and europe but were adversely impacted in 2014 by a decline in our chinese industrialrelated sales emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries overall chinese market conditions for our industrialrelated products were weak during 2014 and 2013 related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain our industrial related products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets experienced modest growth during 2014 primarily driven by strong project activity in europe offset in part by reduced sales in the americas due to the timing of project 

 28 

activity traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2015  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy for example we are in the process of adding approximately 200 field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities we also aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness crossselling and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities aimed at increasing the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 36  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 25year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 16  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and benefit as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage into secondtier cities with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities overall market conditions in emerging markets improved during 2014 but remain below our longterm expectations we experienced a 3  increase in emerging market local currency sales during 2014 versus the prior year offset in part by reduced sales volume in russia chinese market conditions for our industrial products also continued to be weak in 2014 related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain within china we are redeploying resources and sales and marketing efforts to the fastergrowing segments of pharma food safety and environment we believe the longterm growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our laboratory process analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

 29 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we have focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement we have also initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years in response to weak market conditions as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 24860 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 23790 million  in 2013  and 23415 million  in 2012  this represents increases of 4  in 2014  and 2  in 2013  in us dollars and 5  and 1  in local currencies respectively 

in 2014  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by 5  in both the americas and europe and 3  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2014  by 6  in the americas 5  in europe and 4  in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below net sales in local currencies for asiarest of world for the year ended december 31 2014 were reduced by approximately 1 due to the exit of certain industrialrelated businesses in china as previously mentioned global market conditions remain uncertain and accordingly we are cautious regarding our sales growth outlook 

as described in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased 4  in both us dollars and local currencies during 2014 and increased by 1  in us dollars and were flat in local currencies in 2013 service revenue including spare parts increased by 7  in us dollars and 8  in local currencies in 2014 and 6  and 5  in us dollars and local currencies respectively in 2013 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products which represented approximately 47  of our total net sales in 2014  increased by 6  in both us dollars and local currencies during 2014  the increase in net sales of our laboratoryrelated products is principally driven by increased volume and favorable price realization in most categories 

net sales of our industrialrelated products which represented approximately 44  of our total net sales in 2014  increased 4  in both us dollars and local currencies during 2014  the increase in net sales of our industrialrelated products includes increased volume and favorable price realization in most product categories particularly in product inspection net sales in 2014 were offset in part by the exit of certain industrialrelated businesses in china which decreased industrialrelated sales in local currency by 1 overall chinese market conditions for our industrialrelated products remain weak growth in china can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recovery is uncertain 

 30 

net sales of our food retailing products which represented approximately 9  of our total net sales in 2014  increased by 2  in both us dollars and local currencies during 2014  the increase in net sales in local currencies of our food retailing products during 2014 is driven by increased project activity in europe offset in part by reduced sales in the americas due to the timing of project activity 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 547  for 2014  compared to 539  for 2013  and 530  for 2012  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 581  for 2014  compared to 573  for 2013  and 562  for 2012  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 428  for 2014  compared to 417  for 2013  and 409  for 2012  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2014 primarily includes favorable price realization and reduced material costs 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 50  for 2014  49  for 2013  and 48  for 2012  research and development expenses in us dollars increased by 6  in 2014 and 3 in 2013  and in local currencies increased 5  in 2014 and 2 in 2013  the increase in our research and development spending levels reflects the timing of research and development project activity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 293  for 2014  compared to 291  for 2013  and 292  for 2012  selling general and administrative expenses increased by 5  in 2014  in both us dollars and local currencies and increased by 1  in both us dollars and local currencies in 2013  the increase includes higher cash incentive compensation and increased investments in our field sales organization as compared to the prior year partially offset by lower employee benefit costs 

amortization expense 

amortization expense was 292 million and 245 million for 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to recent investment in information technology including the companys blue ocean program 

restructuring charges 

during the past few years we initiated additional cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions for the year ended december 31 2014  we have incurred 59 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2014  

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 22 million  in 2014  compared to net charges of 31 million and 11 million in 2013  and 2012  respectively other charges income net consists primarily of gains losses from foreign currency transactions interest income and other items 

 31 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 245 million  for 2014  compared to 227 million for 2013  and 228 million for   2012  

our annual effective tax rate was 24  for 2014 2013 and 2012 our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers in 2014 reflects strong growth in most of our product categories particularly laboratoryrelated products due to increased sales volume and favorable price realization offset in part by reduced net sales in food retailing due to the timing of project activity 

segment profit decreased by 38 million  in our us operations segment during 2014  compared to a decrease of 11 million  during 2013  the decrease in segment profit primarily related to a reduction in intersegment royalty income increased sales and service investments and higher cash incentive expense offset in part by increased net sales 

swiss operations amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales in us dollars increased by 5  in 2014  and 7  in 2013  and in local currencies increased by 4 in 2014  and 5 in 2013  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 4  in 2014  and 6  in 2013  and in local currencies increased by 3 in 2014  and 5 in 2013  the increase in local currency net sales to external customers includes particularly strong volume growth in analytical instruments and coreindustrial products 

 32 

segment profit increased by 228 million  in our swiss operations segment during 2014  compared to an increase of 210 million  during 2013  segment profit includes the impact of increased intersegment royalty income and net sales partially offset by unfavorable currency and increased cash incentive compensation 

western european operations amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales in us dollars increased by 7  in 2014  and 5 in 2013  and in local currencies increased by 6 in 2014  and 3 in 2013  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 6  in 2014  and 5  in 2013  and in local currencies increased by 6 in 2014  and 2 in 2013  the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers includes volume increases and favorable price realization across most product categories 

segment profit increased by 87 million  in our western european operations segment during 2014  compared to an increase of 164 million  in 2013  segment profit benefited from increased net sales offset in part by increased sales and service investments higher cash incentive expense and unfavorable currency 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales in us dollars increased 3  in 2014  and were flat in 2013  and in local currencies increased by 2 in 2014  and decreased by 2 in 2013  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 2  and decreased by 6  in 2014  and 2013  respectively and in local currencies increased by 1 in 2014  and decreased by 8 in 2013  the increase in net sales to external customers includes strong growth in most laboratoryrelated products offset in part by a decline in coreindustrial products the exit of certain industrialrelated businesses decreased local currency net sales to external customers by approximately 2 in 2014 overall chinese market conditions for our industrialrelated products remain weak growth in china can be expected to be volatile and the timing of a recovery is uncertain 

segment profit increased by 103 million  in our chinese operations segment during 2014  compared to a decrease of 30 million  in 2013  the increase in segment profit includes increased net sales favorable business mix and increased price realization offset in part by investments in sales and service 

 33 

other amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales and net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 4  in 2014 and 1  in 2013 and in local currencies increased by 8 and 5 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers reflects increased sales volume and favorable price realization in most product categories particularly product inspection and coreindustrial products 

segment profit increased by 28 million  in our other segment during 2014  compared to an increase of 08 million  during 2013  the increase in segment profit includes sales volume growth and favorable price realization partially offset by unfavorable currency and increased sales and marketing investments 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions as previously mentioned global market conditions remain uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a prolonged slowdown in global market conditions 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 4189 million  in 2014  compared to 3459 million  in 2013  and 3277 million  in 2012  the increase in 2014 is primarily due to a reduction in working capital particularly accounts receivable offset in part by the timing of tax and higher cash incentive payments 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 894 million  in 2014  823 million  in 2013  and 956 million  in 2012  

cash flows used in financing activities during 2014  included proceeds of 125 million from the issuance of our 384 senior notes as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1617499 shares and 1321577 shares in the amount of 4140 million  and 2950 million  during 2014  and 2013  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2014  we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity

issuance costs approximating 09 million will be amortized to interest expense over the tenyear term of the senior notes 

credit agreement 

in 2013 we entered into an 800 million  amended credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 880 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of november 26 2018  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2014  set at libor plus 75 basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in our previously issued debt as described above with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2014 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default we incurred approximately 04 million  of debt extinguishment costs during 2013 related to the prior credit agreement we capitalized 11 million  in financing fees during 2013 associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through 2018  as of december 31 2014  approximately 6848 million  was available under the facility 

 36 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2014  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2014  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 37 

share repurchase program 

we have a 3 billion share repurchase program of which there was 4784 million  remaining to be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2014 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of repurchases will depend on business and market conditions stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 231 million  shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2014  during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we spent 4140 million  and 2950 million  on the repurchase of 1617499 shares and 1321577 shares at an average price per share of 25593  and 22318  respectively we reissued 373431  and 398646 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2014  and 2013  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

in january 2015 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro through 2016 the notional amount and average forward rate of our foreign currency forward contracts is euro 86 million and 121 for contracts that mature in 2015 and euro 67 million and 119 for contracts that mature in 2016 respectively in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro which was abandoned in january 2015 after we entered into the previously mentioned foreign currency forward contracts the swiss national banks abandonment of the euro exchange rate floor resulted in an immediate strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar absent these forward currency forward contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 11million to 13 million annually we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 05 million to 07 million annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro impact 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results the most significant of these currency exposures is the chinese renminbi the impact on our earnings before tax of the chinese renminbi weakening 1 against the us dollar is a reduction of approximately 07 million to 09 million annually 

 38 

in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2014 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 23 million in the reported us dollar value of our debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 04 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 39 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 02 million  net loss at december 31 2014  a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and the euro declined by 10  the fair value of these instruments would increase by 62 million  at december 31 2014  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 38 million  at december 31 2014  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2014  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 32 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 34 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2014  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes and revenue we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 

 40 

apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2014  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014  were 35 million  and 1644 million  respectively for our us pension plan the net periodic benefit for 2014  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014  were 04 million  and 8636 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2014  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2014  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 18 million  and 38 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2014  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 75  for the us plan and 48  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 67 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2014  the average discount rate assumption was 40  for the us plan and 17  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 106 million after tax 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 180 million  and 176 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plans 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 41 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2014  trade accounts receivable were 4356 million  net of a 160 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2014  inventories were 2045 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2014  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4441 million  and other intangible assets of 1128 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets and the estimated fair values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying values 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 42 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 4450 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  each increase of 45 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohausbranded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 

 7 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1 of 2013 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2013 our sales and service group consisted of approximately 6200 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 36  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services as well as further expansion of our offerings to provide valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance performance enhancements application expertise and training and remote services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with fda and other international regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts on demand services and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22  of our net sales in 2013 and 21 in both 2012 and 2011 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers which provides us with highquality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 8 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 345 million  in research and development  1163 million  in 2013 1125 million in 2012 and 1161 million in 2011 which is approximately 5  of net sales our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1200 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china switzerland the united states germany and the united kingdom we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december 31 2013 was approximately 12500  throughout the world including approximately 4900  in europe 3300  in north and south america and 4300  in asia and other countries 

 9 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees  approximately   600   employees in germany and france are represented by unions   

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders we produced our first sustainability report in 2011 which outlined our greenmt program launched in 2010 to improve our understanding of how our business affects the environment we have gathered data to understand the magnitude of the global greenhouse gas or co2 footprint generated not only by our fuel and electricity use but also by the products we sell and our use of supply chains we are now working on making significant reductions in these emissions by finding new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss chinese and certain us operations and now have approximately half of the program completed as measured in users we expect to implement the program in germany and additional operations in the us over the next two years   

intellectual property 

we hold over 4800  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 10 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 11 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

we sell primarily to companies in developed countries continued economic uncertainty in these countries could hurt our operating results 

most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including sovereign debt levels in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business in addition if developed countries continue to experience slow growth or recession we could see the following effects 

 

economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

concerns regarding the european debt levels and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations in addition concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

 13 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 17  of sales to external customers and approximately 30  of our global production and 26  of segment profit during 2013  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 

including the following 

 we must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and to repatriate these funds if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in china 

we are required to comply with various import export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our net sales to external customers in china decreased 8 in 2013 versus the previous year in local currencies primarily related to weaker market conditions these market conditions reflect overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or 

 14 

specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to maintain these advantages 

we are vulnerable to system failures including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in interruptions in our services or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

we also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system this has been proceeding on a staggered basis over several years with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the program in our swiss chinese and certain us operations and now have approximately half of the program implemented as measured in users if the implementation is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted 

we have key manufacturing facilities located in china europe and the united states many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities in addition a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties if we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services and lose sales it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 15 

our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material 

we purchase most of our raw materials components and supplies from multiple suppliers some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply however and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products even where multiple sources of materials and components are available the quality of the alternative materials regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales if we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

if we do not introduce new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results a reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers ability to purchase our products 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 16 

our tax expense could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment governments are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends or capital on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able 

 17 

to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 18 

 we may be adversely affected by new regulations relating to conflict minerals 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2013  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4558 million  and other intangible assets of 1144 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense we make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in 

 19 

impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

a few factors help us manage these exchange rate risks in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro the floor has effectively stopped the strengthening of the swiss franc beyond the 120 level we do not know how long the swiss national bank will maintain this exchange rate floor additionally in the third quarter of 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce approximately 75 of our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro the forward contracts expire in january 2015 absent these forward exchange contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 12 million annually the impact on our earnings before tax of the swiss franc strengthening against the us dollar is approximately 04 million annually 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2013 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 85 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2013  we had total indebtedness of approximately 3011 million  net of cash of 1119 million  our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

 20 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 800 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 13  financial institutions which individually have between 2  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2013  we had borrowings of 1960 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 800 million  amount available 

we make forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share you should not rely on forwardlooking statements to predict our actual results our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties 

our forwardlooking statements may not be accurate or complete and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results new risks also periodically arise please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forwardlooking statements see in particular “factors affecting our future operating results” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in providing guidance on our future earnings we evaluate our budgets strategic plans and other factors relating to our business we make assumptions about external factors including the following 

  21 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no single customer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to factors beyond our control including general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors described in this section 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

net sales in us dollars increased by 2  in 2013  and by 1  in 2012  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 1  in 2013  and 4  in 2012  net sales growth during 2013 was particularly impacted by weak global market conditions particularly in china as further described below global market conditions remain uncertain and accordingly we are cautious regarding our net sales growth outlook however we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth opportunities improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes further penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services   

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2013 versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets increased during 2013 in our developed markets however demand from these markets was partially   

 27 

offset by reduced demand from universities and governmentfunded research institutions as well as difficult market conditions in china 

our industrial markets especially coreindustrial products were adversely impacted in 2013 by a deterioration in global market conditions especially in china emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries overall chinese market conditions for our products were weak during 2013 related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain our industrial products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets experienced modest growth during 2013 related to increases in the americas and asiarest of world offset by a decline in europe the net sales increases were primarily related to increased project activity in the americas offset in part by unfavorable economic conditions in europe traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors du e to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2014  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness crossselling and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 35  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 25year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 17  on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and benefit as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage into secondtier cities with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also bee n a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities however market conditions especially in china deteriorated during 2013 and we experienced a   2   decline in emerging market local currency sales during 2013 versus the prior year primarily related to a reduction in chinese sales volume chinese market conditions for our products were weak in 2013 related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china and other emerging markets can be expected to be volatile and the timing of recoveries can be uncertain within china we are redeploying resources and sales and marketing efforts to the faster growing segments of pharma food safety and environment we believe the longterm growth of these 

 28 

segments will be favorably impacted by the chinese governments emphasis on science highvalue industries and product quality we expect our laboratory process analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments   

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we have initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years in response to weakening market conditions we have also focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during 2011 we acquired an xray inspection solutions business in the united states and a vision inspection solutions business in germany both of which have been integrated into our endofline product inspection systems offering 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 23790 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 23415 million  in 2012  and 23093 million  in 2011  this represents increases of 2  in 2013  and 1  in 2012  in us dollars and 1  and 4  in local currencies respectively 

in 2013  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by 3  in the americas and 6  in europe and decreased 5  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2013  by 3  in both the americas and europe while net sales in asiarest of world decreased 4  a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below net sales in local currencies for asiarest of world for the year ended december 31 2013 were reduced by approximately 1 due to the exit of certain industrialrelated businesses in china as previously mentioned global market conditions remain uncertain and accordingly we are cautious regarding our sales growth outlook 

as described in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased 1  in us dollars and were flat in local currencies during 2013 and increased by 1  in us dollars and 4  in local currencies in 2012 service revenue including spare parts increased by 6  in u s dollars and 5  in local currencies in 2013 and 1  and 5  in us dollars and local currencies respectively in 2012

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products which represented approximately 46  of our total net sales in 2013  increased by 3  in both us dollars and local currencies during 2013  net sales of our laboratoryrelated products included strong growth in europe which is partly related to an easier prior year comparison these results were partially offset by a slight decline in sales volume in asia  rest of world particularly china primarily related to difficult market conditions and a challenging prior period comparison net sales growth during the year also reflected modest growth in most product categories which included favorable price realization   

net sales of our industrialrelated products which represented approximately 45  of our total net sales in 2013  were flat in us dollars and decreased 1  in local currencies during 2013  the decrease in net sales of our industrialrelated products included volume declines in asiarest of world particularly china primarily due to unfavorable market conditions in addition the exit of certain businesses in china reduced net sales in our industrialrelated products by approximately 1 for the year ended december 31 2013 we also experienced a volume decline in coreindustrial products in the americas and asiarest of world offset in part by strong growth in product inspection related to higher sales volume and favorable price realization 

net sales in our food retailing products which represented approximately   9   of our total net sales in   2013  increased by   3   in us dollars and   1   in local currencies during   2013  the increase in net sales of our food retailing markets included strong volume growth in the americas due to increased project activity these results were partly offset by decreased sales volume in europe primarily related to unfavorable market conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 539  for 2013  compared to 530  for 2012  and 528  for 2011  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 573  for 2013  compared to 562  for 2012  and 563  for 2011  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 416  for 2013  compared to 409  for 2012  and 394  for 2011  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2013  primarily reflects increased price realization favorable business mix and reduced material costs offset in part by unfavorable currency 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 49  for 2013  48  for 2012  and 50  for 2011  research and development expenses in us dollars increased by 3  in 2013 and decreased 3 in 2012  and in local currencies increased 2  in 2013 and were flat in 2012  our research and development spending levels reflect the timing of projects and product launch activities offset by benefits from our increased activities in lowcost countries 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 291  for 2013  compared to 292  for 2012  and 305  for 2011  selling general and administrative expenses in us dollars increased by 1  in 2013  and decreased by 3  in 2012  and in local currencies increased 1  in 2013  and were flat in 2012  selling general and administrative expenses include increased sales and marketing investments including product launch activity offset in part by benefits from our cost reduction activities

restructuring charges 

during 2012 and 2013 we initiated additional cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions for the year ending december 31 2013  we have incurred 198 million  of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise employeerelated costs see note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2013  

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 31 million  in 2013  compared to net charges of 11 million  and 24 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively other charges income net consists primarily of gains losses from foreign currency transactions interest income and other items 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 227 million  for 2013  compared to 228 million  for 2012  and 232 million  for 2011  

our annual effective tax rate was 24  for both 2013 and 2012 and 23  for 2011  our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china 

during 2011  we recorded a discrete tax item resulting in net tax benefits of 38 million  primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters the discrete tax item had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 1  in 2011  

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

us operations amounts in thousands 



the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers during 2013  reflected particularly strong growth in product inspection sales volume and food retailing project activity these results were offset in part by a modest decline in coreindustrial products due to reduced sales volume 

segment profit decreased by 05 million  in our us operations segment during 2013  compared to an increase of 175 million  during 2012  the decrease in segment profit was primarily due to unfavorable business mix and increased sales and marketing expenses partially offset by favorable price realization

 total net sales in us dollars increased by 5  in 2013  and decreased by 7 in 2012  and in local currencies increased by 3 in 2013  and decreased by 1 in 2012  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 5  in 2013  and decreased by 7 in 2012  and in local currencies increased by 2 in 2013  and decreased by 1 in 2012  total net sales and net sales to external customers for 2013 in local currencies primarily reflect strong growth in laboratoryrelated products due to increased sales volume and favorable price realization partially offset by a sales volume decline in food retailing while industrialrelated sales remained flat versus the prior year 

segment profit increased by 163 million  in our western european operations segment during 2013  compared to a decrease of 44 million  in 2012  segment profit benefited from increased sales volume favorable price realization and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations

chinese operations amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales in us dollars were flat in 2013  and increased by 8  in 2012  and in local currencies decreased by 2 in 2013  and increased by 6 in 2012  net sales to external customers in us dollars decreased by 6  and increased by 11  in 2013  and 2012  respectively and in local currencies decreased by 8 in 2013  and increased by 9 in 2012  the decrease in net sales to external customers during 2013 reflects a decline in sales volume for most product categories particularly industrialrelated products approximately 1 of the sales decline in 2013 also relates to the exit of certain industrialrelated businesses in china  overall chinese market conditions for our products were weak in 2013 related to overcapacity in certain enduser segments and a reduction of credit availability for many local chinese customers growth in china can be expected to be volatile and the timing of a recovery can be uncerta in 

segment profit decreased by 30 million  in our chinese operations segment during 2013  compared to an increase of 44 million  in 2012  the decrease in segment profit for 2013 primarily includes reduced sales volume to external customers increased research and development activities and higher sales and marketing expenditures offset by reduced material costs favorable price realization and improved business mix 

other amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales and net sales to external customers increased by 2  in 2013 and 5  in 2012 and in local currencies increased by 5 and 8 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in local currencies total net sales and net sales to external customers reflects increased growth in most product categories especially product inspection and laboratoryrelated products these results were partially offset by a sales volume decline in food retailing 

segment profit increased by 04 million  in our other segment during 2013  compared to a decrease of 12 million  during 2012  the increase in segment profit in 2013 is primarily due to increased sales volume and favorable business mix partially offset by cost transfers of certain internal support functions from other segments and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions as previously mentioned global market conditions were weak during 2013 particularly in china our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged slowdown in global market conditions 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 3459 million  in 2013  compared to 3277 million  in 2012  and 2809 million  in 2011  the increase in 2013  is primarily due to decreased cash incentive payments of approximately 25 million as compared to 2012 as well as increased deferred revenue and customer prepayments offset in part by timing of accounts receivables increased inventory levels and higher pension payments the increase in 2012 resulted principally from increased net earnings and working capital benefits related to decreased inventory levels and the timing of accounts receivable partially offset by the timing of payables we also made 176 million and 10 million of voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 823 million  in 2013  956 million  in 2012  and 985 million  in 2011  

cash flows used in financing activities during 2013  included proceeds of 50 million from the issuance of our 410 senior notes as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1321577 shares and 1637827 shares in the amount of 2950 million  and 2787 million  during 2013  and 2012  respectively 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

in august 2011 we acquired a leader in vision inspection technology for endofline product systems located in germany that has been integrated into our endofline product inspection product offering for an aggregate purchase price of 194 million we paid an additional cash consideration of 03 million  during 2012 related to an earnout period we also paid additional contingent cash consideration of 78 million in 2011 related to an earnout associated with an acquisition in 2009 these additional cash consideration payments are included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during the first quarter 2011 we completed acquisitions totaling 154 million of which 120 million related to an xray inspection solutions business that has been integrated into our product inspection product offering 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2013  we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

630 senior notes 

in 2009  we issued and sold 100 million  of 630  senior notes due june 25 2015  in a private placement the 630 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 

 34 

interest on the 630  senior notes is payable semiannually in june and december we may at any time prepay the 630 senior notes in whole or in part but in an amount not less than 10  of the original aggregate principal amount at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “makewhole” prepayment premium in the event of a change in control of the company as defined in the note purchase agreement we may be required to offer to prepay the 630 senior notes in whole at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the 630  senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including among others limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness disposition of assets mergers and transactions with affiliates the note purchase agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10  and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10  the agreement contains customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 

issuance costs approximating 07 million  will be amortized to interest expense over the six year term of the 630 senior notes 

367 senior notes 

in 2012  we issued and sold 50 million  of 367  senior notes due december 17 2022  in a private placement the 367 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest is payable semiannually in june and december 

the 367 senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants change in control and prepayment provisions that are substantially similar to those contained in the previously issued debt of the company as described above the 367 senior notes also contain customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 

issuance costs approximating 04 million  will be amortized to interest expense over the ten year term of the 367 senior notes 

410 senior notes 

in the third quarter of 2013 we issued and sold 50 million of 410 senior notes due september 2023 in a private placement the 410 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company interest on the 410 senior notes is payable semiannually in march and september of each year beginning in march 2014 

the 410 senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants change in control and prepayment provisions that are substantially similar to those contained in the previously issued debt of the company as described above the 410 senior notes also contain customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 

issuance costs approximating 04 million will be amortized to interest expense over the 10year term of the 410 senior notes 

credit agreement 

in november 2013 we entered into an 800 million  amended credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 880 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior   

 35 

credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of november 26 2018  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2013  set at libor plus 75 basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in our previously issued debt as described above with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2013 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default we incurred approximately 04 million  of debt extinguishment costs during 2013 related to the prior credit agreement we capitalized 11 million  in financing fees during 2013 associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through 2018  as of december 31 2013  approximately 6000 million  was available under the facility 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2013  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates further we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

 36 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2013  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

we have a 3 billion share repurchase program which includes an additional 750 million that was authorized by the board of directors during 2013 as of december 31 2013  there was 892 million  of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of repurchases will depend on business and market conditions stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors 

we have purchased 215 million  shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through december 31 2013  during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  we spent 2950 million  and 2787 million  on the repurchase of 1321577 shares and 1637827 shares at an average price per share of 22318  and 17013  respectively we reissued 398646  and 457732 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2013  and 2012  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates we are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the swiss franc euro and us dollar we have more swiss franc expenses than 

 37 

we do swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland when the swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the us dollar and euro our earnings go down we also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses when the euro weakens against the us dollar and swiss franc our earnings also go down 

a few factors help us manage these exchange rate risks in september 2011 the swiss national bank established an exchange rate floor of 120 swiss francs per euro the floor has effectively stopped the strengthening of the swiss franc beyond the 120 level we do not know how long the swiss national bank will maintain this exchange rate floor additionally in the third quarter of 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce approximately 75 of our exposure from the swiss franc strengthening against the euro the forward contracts expire in january 2015 absent these forward exchange contracts we estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately 12 million annually the impact on our earnings before tax of the swiss franc strengthening against the us dollar is approximately 04 million annually 

we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2013 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 85 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc known as hispeed checkweigher co inc was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection in an administrative consent order signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in landing new jersey after the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the order residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area which the department of environmental protection has approved and within which the company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the 

 38 

site the department of environmental protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 04 million  net gain at december 31 2013  a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and the euro declined by 10  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 03 million  at december 31 2013  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 40 million  at december 31 2013  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2013  a 100basispoint increase decrease in interest rates would result in an increase decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 19 million  any change in fair value would not affect our 

 39 

consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2013  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2013  were 69 million  and 1381 million  respectively for our us pension plan and 54 million  and 8142 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement benefit for 2013  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2013  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 03 million  and 53 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2013  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 75  for the us plan and 49  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 69 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2013  the average discount rate assumption was 48  for the us plan and 27  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 61 million after tax 

 40 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 176 million  and 10 million  in 2013 and 2012 respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plans 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2013  trade accounts receivable were 4667 million  net of a 149 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2013  inventories were 2104 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2013  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4558 million  and other intangible assets of 1144 million 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 41 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 4027 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  each increase of 40 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

     revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for 

 42 

separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

warranty 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

industrial weighing instruments 

we offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances such as bench scales and floor scales for weighing loads from a few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing packages our products are used in a wide range of applications such as counting applications and in formulating and mixing ingredients 

industrial terminals 

our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it into manufacturing processes helping to automate them our terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather than reactive maintenance 

transportation and logistics 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and data capture solutions which integrate inmotion weighing dimensioning and identification technologies with these solutions customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of packages for appropriate billing logistics and quality control our solutions also integrate into customers’ information systems

customers and distribution 

our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food and beverage producers food retailers chemical specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic community 

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1  of 2012 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2012  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 6220 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 36  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair and preventative maintenance services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance qualification calibration and certification we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 21  of our net sales in 2012  and 2011  and 23  in 2010  a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 3256 million  in research and development  1125 million  in 2012  1161 million  in 2011  and 970 million  in 2010  in 2012  we spent approximately 48  of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely 

integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1180 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 26  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december 31 2012  was approximately 12400  throughout the world including approximately 4600  in europe 3400  in north and south america and 4300  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders we produced our first sustainability report in 2011 which outlined our greenmt program which was launched in 2010 to improve our understanding of how our business affects the environment we have gathered data to understand the magnitude of the global greenhouse gas or co2 footprint generated not only by our fuel and electricity use but also the products we sell and our use of supply chains we are now working to establish goals and will start to make reductions in these emissions this includes new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new 

design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes have been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately onethird of the program completed as measured in users we expect to implement the program in the united states and germany over the next two years and will then have more than half of the companys users on the system incremental capital expenditures for the blue ocean program are more than 20 million  annually this amount may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates we expect the return on this investment when complete to include improved realized pricing reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 

intellectual property 

we hold over 4650  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our 

competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc “mt” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a certain property in landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these 

investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries continued economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely affect our operating results 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including the potential for a sovereign debt crisis in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely concerns regarding this potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets more specifically an escalation of the european or us debt crises could have the following adverse effects 

 

        because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in uncertain or difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions 

in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and more specifically on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets and have a significant concentration of business in china 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 4323 million  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 1252 million  of segment profit during 2012  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

while we continued to experience sales growth in emerging markets during 2012  growth in china was lower than recent years fluctuating economic conditions and the current change in chinas political leadership may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets in the future certain emerging markets have also experienced currency devaluations and inflationary prices economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however fluctuating economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations in these markets 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

we are vulnerable to system failures including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

we also are in the process of implementing our blue ocean program a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system the implementation of this program has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multiyear period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately onethird of the program completed as measured in users we expect to implement the program in the united states and germany over the next two years and will then have more than half of the companys users on the system if the implementation of any unit is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation of blue ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

an interruption in our business due to events such as disruptions with our supply chain natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires or explosions may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous 

in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 we may be adversely affected by new regulations relating to conflict minerals 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers andor lead to a loss of revenue these new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at prices similar to the past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2012  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4524 million  and other intangible assets of 1176 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual 

growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

our tax expense could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 

as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment governments in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate are facing greater pressure on public finances which could lead to an increased tendency for a more aggressive application of existing tax laws and regulations governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time also implement changes to tax laws and regulations any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations on repatriation of dividends or capital on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and lead to increases in our overall tax burden which would negatively affect our profitability 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor during the third quarter of 2011 the swiss national bank established a floor of 120 relating to the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro the duration for which the swiss national bank will 

maintain this exchange rate floor of 120 is currently unknown beginning in the third quarter of 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts as described in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements which reduce our exposure to a strengthening of the swiss franc versus the euro these forward contracts currently continue until january 2014 we estimate absent these forward contracts that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately 08 million  to 12 million  on an annual basis the previously described foreign currency forward contracts reduce this exposure by approximately 75 we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 07 million  to 09 million  on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2012  we estimate that a 10  weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 62 million  in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2012  we had total indebtedness of approximately 2870 million  net of cash of 1017 million  we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and is subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them 

under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 880 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 17  financial institutions who individually have between 1  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2012  we had borrowings of 1971 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 880 million  

we make from time to time forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we from time to time provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “factors affecting our future operating results” in the “business” section and the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of this annual report on form 10k which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forwardlooking statements we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict these new risk factors nor can it assess the impact if any of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 

in providing guidance on our future earnings our management evaluates our budgets our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors some of the key external assumptions include 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no one customer accounts for more than 1  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

local currency changes exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

during 2012  the global environment has deteriorated especially in europe net sales in us dollars increased by 1 in 2012  and increased by 17  in 2011  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 4 in 2012  and 13  in 2011  we expect our local currency organic sales growth in 2013 will continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions given economic uncertainty it is difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected however we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering investment in emerging markets and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples include identifying and investing in growth opportunities improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes further penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2012  versus the prior year in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets increased during 2012  particularly in emerging markets however demand from these markets was 

partially offset by reduced demand from universities and governmentfunded research institutions in developed markets as well as difficult economic conditions in europe we expect net sales growth of our laboratoryrelated products particularly in europe to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

our industrial markets especially coreindustrial products were adversely impacted in 2012 by deterioration in global economic conditions especially in europe our industrial markets were also impacted by lower sales growth in china as compared to recent years emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries we expect net sales growth of our industrial related products particularly in europe and china to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected our industrial products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets experienced a decline during 2012  related to decreases in europe and asiarest of world the net sales declines were primarily related to reduced project activity as well as unfavorable economic conditions traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2013  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness crossselling and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 36  of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 25year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 20  on a compound annual growth basis in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage into second tier cities with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities local currency sales increased in emerging markets by 9  during 2012  versus the prior year sales increases were experienced throughout most markets however growth in china was less than recent years we anticipate sales in 2013  will continue to increase as compared to 2012  absent a further deterioration in global economic conditions however we expect local currency sales growth will be less than growth rates experienced in 

2011 to reduce costs we also continue to shift more of our manufacturing to china where our four facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we significantly reduced our global cost structure during 2009 in response to the global economic slowdown and took further actions during 2012 in response to the recent deterioration in the global economy we have also focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during 2011 we acquired an xray inspection solutions business in the united states and a vision inspection solutions business in germany both of which have been integrated into our endofline product inspection systems offering during 2010 we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 23415 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 23093 million  in 2011  and 19682 million  in 2010  this represents increases in 2012  and 2011  of 1 and 17  in us dollars and 4 and 13  in local currencies respectively 

in 2012  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by 4  in the americas and 11  in asiarest of world and decreased by 8  in europe in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2012  by 5  in the americas and 10  in asiarest of world while net sales in europe decreased 2  a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below acquisitionsdivestitures net contributed approximately 1 in america and 2 in europe to net sales growth during 2012  net sales in local currencies during december 31 2011 increased 9 in the americas 11 in europe and 20 in asiarest of world as previously mentioned the global environment has deteriorated especially in europe we expect our local currency organic sales growth in 2013 will continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions given economic uncertainty it is difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

as described in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased by 1  and 20  in 2012  and 2011  respectively in us dollars and by 4  and 15  respectively in local currencies service revenue including spare parts increased in 2012  and 2011  by 1  and 9  respectively in u s dollars respectively and 5  in both periods in local currencies 

  

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products which represented approximately 46 of our total net sales in 2012  increased by 2  in us dollars and 5  in local currencies during 2012  this compares to strong local currency net sales growth of 9 in 2011 we experienced modest sales growth in most laboratoryrelated products with solid growth in process analytics and analytical instruments sales growth in 2012 benefited from favorable price realization as well as volume increases particularly in asiarest of world we expect net sales growth of our laboratoryrelated products particularly in europe to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

net sales of our industrialrelated products which represented approximately 45 of our total net sales in 2012  increased by 2  in us dollars and 4  in local currencies during 2012  this compares to strong local currency net sales growth of 19 in 2011 acquisitions contributed approximately 1 to our industrialrelated net sales growth during 2012  our industrialrelated products experienced strong organic sales growth in product inspection products related to increased volume and favorable price realization offset in part by a decline in our european coreindustrial business related to decreased sales volume which is related to difficult prior period comparisons and unfavorable economic conditions in europe we also experienced reduced industrialrelated sales growth in asiarest of world in 2012 which is primarily related to reduced growth in china we expect net sales of our industrialrelated products particularly in europe and china to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

net sales in our food retailing products which represented approximately 9 of our total net sales in 2012  decreased by 7  in us dollars and 4  in local currencies during 2012  we experienced local currency net sales declines in europe and asiarest of world during 2012 the net sales declines were primarily related to reduced project activity as well as unfavorable economic conditions local currency net sales growth was strong in the americas related to incremental project activity and an easier prior period comparison we expect net sales in our food retailing products may continue to decline in future quarters it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 530  for 2012  compared to 528  for 2011  and 527  for 2010  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 562  for 2012  compared to 563  for 2011  and 565  for 2010  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 409  for 2012  compared to 394  for 2011  and 395  for 2010  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2012 was primarily due to improved price realization reduced material costs and favorable currency translation fluctuations these results were partly offset by unfavorable geographic mix and increased investments in our field service organization 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 48  for 2012  50  for 2011  and 49  for 2010  research and development expenses in us dollars decreased by 3 in 2012 and increased 20  in 2011  and in local currencies were flat in 2012 and increased 9  in 2011  our research and development spending levels reflect changes in part due to the timing of project launch activity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 292  for 2012  compared to 305  for 2011  and 299  for 2010  selling general and administrative expenses in us dollars decreased by 3  in 2012 and increased 20  in 2011  and in local currencies were flat in 2012 and increased by 13  in 2011  the amount in 2012  reflects increased sales and marketing investments especially in emerging markets offset by lower cash incentives and savings from our cost reduction programs 

restructuring charges 

during 2012 we initiated additional cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions for the year ending december 31 2012 we have incurred 167 million of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise severance costs see note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2012  

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 11 million  in 2012  compared to net charges of 24 million  and 42 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively other charges income net consists primarily of interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items other charges income net in 2010 also includes a 44 million   38 million  aftertax charge associated with the sale of our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions this amount was partially offset by a benefit from unrealized contingent consideration from a previous acquisition totaling 12 million   12 million  aftertax 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 228 million  for 2012  compared to 232 million  for 2011  and 201 million  for 2010  the decrease in interest expense for 2012  is primarily resulting from a decrease in average borrowings partially offset by an increase in rates for the period the 2011  amount reflects additional borrowings in the fourth quarter 2010 in order to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation 

during 2011  and 2010  we recorded discrete tax items resulting in net tax benefits of 38 million  and 52 million  primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters 

our annual effective tax rate was 24  23  and 25  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 1  in both 2011 and 2010  our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china 

results of operations — by operating segment 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements

the increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers during 2012  includes strong growth in process analytics and product inspection due to increased sales volume and favorable price realization net sales and net sales to external customers in food retailing products also experienced strong growth during 2012 due to increased project activity 

segment profit increased by 175 million  in our us operations segment during 2012  compared to an increase of 04 million  during 2011  segment profit in 2012  includes increased sales volume favorable price realization higher intersegment income improved productivity and lower cash incentive expense

segment profit increased by 197 million  in our swiss operations segment during 2012  compared to a increase of 174 million  during 2011  the increase in segment profit during 2012  is primarily due to increased intersegment sales in local currency benefits from our cost reduction activities and lower cash incentive expense segment profit also benefited from favorable currency translation fluctuations during 2012

total net sales in us dollars decreased by 7  in 2012  and increased by 16 in 2011  and in local currencies decreased by 1 in 2012  and increased by 10 in 2011  net sales to external customers in us dollars decreased by 7  in 2012  and increased by 15 in 2011  and in local currencies decreased by 1 in 2012  and by increased 9 in 2011  net sales in our western european operations benefited approximately 1 from acquisitions during 2012  total net sales and net sales to external customers for 2012 includes sales volume declines in most product categories especially food retailing and coreindustrial products our western european operations continue to face unfavorable economic conditions and we expect local currency sales to external customers will be adversely impacted during the first half of 2013 

segment profit decreased by 44 million  in our western european operations segment during 2012  compared to an increase of 148 million  in 2011  the decrease in segment profit in 2012  resulted primarily from a decrease in local currency sales volume and unfavorable currency translation fluctuations partially offset by improved price realization and initial benefits from our cost reduction activities 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 



 

 total net sales in us dollars increased by 8  in 2012  and 27  in 2011  and in local currencies increased by 6 in 2012  and 22 in 2011  net sales to external customers in us dollars increased by 11  and 30  in 2012  and 2011  respectively and in local currencies increased by 9 in 2012  and 25 in 2011  the local currency increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers in 2012  includes particularly strong growth in laboratoryrelated products modest growth in industrialrelated products and a decline in food retailing we expect local currency sales growth to external customers in 2013 will continue to be less than growth rates experienced in 2011 

segment profit increased by 44 million  in our chinese operations segment during 2012  compared to an increase of 279 million  in 2011  the increase in segment profit in 2012  includes increased sales volume and favorable price realization partially offset by increased intersegment expenses 

other amounts in thousands

especially laboratoryrelated products related to increased sales volume and favorable price realization geographically we also experienced particularly strong growth in other asia pacific 

segment profit decreased by 12 million  in our other segment during 2012  compared to a increase of 149 million  during 2011  the decrease in segment profit during 2012  relates primarily to increased costs from other segments and investments in sales and marketing partially offset by an increase in sales volume 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions as previously mentioned global economic conditions deteriorated during 2012 our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global economic slowdown 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 3277 million  in 2012  compared to 2809 million  in 2011  and 2683 million  in 2010  the increase in 2012  resulted principally from increased net earnings and working capital benefits related to decreased inventory levels and the timing of accounts receivable partially offset by the timing of payables the increase in 2011 resulted principally from increased net earnings partially offset by increased incentive payments of approximately 39 million related to previous year performancerelated compensation incentives as well as increased working capital associated with the increased sales volume and higher tax payments we also made 10 million  and 50 million  of voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2012 and 2010  respectively 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 956 million  in 2012  985 million  in 2011  and 739 million  in 2010  our capital expenditures in 2012  included approximately 479 million  of investments directly related to our blue ocean multiyear program of information technology investment compared with 557 million  in 2011  and 306 million  in 2010  

cash flows used in financing activities during 2012  included proceeds of 50 million from the issuance of our 367 senior notes and payments of 04 million  of debt issuance costs as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1637827 shares and 1285827 shares in the amount of 2787 million  and 2046 million  during 2012  and 2011  respectively cash flows used in financing activities during 2010 also included the repayment of our 75 million 485 senior notes which matured on november 15 2010 the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

in august 2011 we acquired a leader in vision inspection technology for endofline product systems located in germany that has been integrated into our endofline product inspection product offering for an aggregate purchase price of 194 million we paid an additional cash consideration of 03 million  during 2012 related to an earnout period we also paid additional contingent cash consideration of 78 million in 2011 related to an earnout associated with an acquisition in 2009 these additional cash consideration payments are included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during the first quarter 2011 we completed acquisitions totaling 154 million of which 120 million related to an xray inspection solutions business that has been integrated into our product inspection product offering 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2012  we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity

issuance costs approximating 04 million  will be amortized to interest expense over the ten year term of the 367 senior notes 

tender offer  repayment of 485 senior notes 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million  of 485  unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 “ 485 senior notes” on may 6 2009 we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding 485 senior notes due november 15 2010 the tender offer which expired may 12 2009 resulted in the repurchase of 75 million  of the principal balance of the 485 senior notes at maturity on november 15 2010 we repaid the remaining 75 million  outstanding principal balance of our 485 senior notes the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 

credit agreement 

on december 20 2011 we entered into an 880 million credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 950 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of december 20 2016 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2012  set at libor plus 0085  basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2012  including maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10  and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10  the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default we incurred approximately 03 million  of debt extinguishment costs during 2011 related to the prior credit agreement we capitalized 31 million  in financing fees during 2011 associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through 2016 as of december 31 2012  approximately 6779 million  was available under the facility 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2012  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

at december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our 630 senior notes 367 senior notes and credit agreement in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2012  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

we have a 225 billion  share repurchase program we expect that the new authorization will be utilized over the next several years as of december 31 2012  there were 437 million  of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors we have purchased 201 million  shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2012  

during the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  we spent 2787 million  and 2046 million  on the repurchase of 1637827 shares and 1285827 shares at an average price per share of 17013  and 15908  respectively we reissued 457732  and 450613 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2012  and 2011  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor during the third quarter of 2011 the swiss national bank established a floor of 120 relating to the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro the duration for which the swiss national bank will maintain this exchange rate floor of 120 is currently unknown beginning in the third quarter of 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts as described in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements which reduce our exposure to a strengthening of the swiss franc versus the euro these forward contracts currently continue until january 2014 we estimate absent these forward contracts that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately 08 million  to 12 million  on an annual basis the previously described foreign currency forward contracts reduce this exposure by approximately 75 we also estimate a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 07 million  to 09 million  on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2012  we estimate that a 10  weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 62 million  in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc “mt” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated njdep has informally told mt to expect a claim for natural resource damages “nrd” regarding this site but has not yet made such a claim in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain 

forecasted intercompany sales such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 02 million  net gain at december 31 2012  a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and the euro declined by 10  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 46 million  at december 31 2012  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a loss of 82 million  at december 31 2012  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2012  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 32 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 27 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2012  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2012  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2012  was 72 million  and 1568 million  respectively for our us pension plan and 43 million  and 7987 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2012  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2012  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan was 01 million  and 113 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the 

assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2012  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 78  for the us plan and 49  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 63 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2012  the average discount rate assumption was 38  for the us plan and 25  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 15 million after tax 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 10 million  and 50 million  in 2012 and 2010  respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2012  trade accounts receivable were 4374 million  net of a 141 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2012  inventories were 1989 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2012  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4524 million  and other intangible assets of 1176 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 

if we are unable to conclude that the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

if we are unable to conclude that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland germany the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 3826 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  each increase of 39 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

     revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location 

further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

warranty 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in 

correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2  of 2011 net sales 

sales and service 

market organizations 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2011  our sales and service group consisted of approximately 

6000 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35  countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair and preventative maintenance services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance qualification calibration and certification we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 21  of our net sales in 2011  23  in 2010  and 25  in 2009  a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

producing organizations 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

research and development 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 3028 million  in research and development  1161 million  in 2011  970 million  in 2010  and 897 million  in 2009  in 2011  we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1125 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

manufacturing 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 26  to 30  of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

employees 

our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december 31 2011  was approximately 12000  throughout the world including approximately 4600  in europe 3200  in north and south america and 4200  in asia and other countries 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

sustainability 

we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for longterm growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees customers and shareholders we produced our first sustainability report during 2011 which outlined our greenmt program which was launched in 2010 to improve our understanding of how our business affects the environment we have gathered data to understand the magnitude of the global greenhouse gas or co2 footprint generated not only by our fuel and electricity use but also the products we sell and our use of supply chains we are now working to establish goals and will start to make reductions in these emissions this includes new ways of managing our vehicle fleets incorporating new design features into our products improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities we think these efforts will produce a 

favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 

blue ocean program 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes with high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a multi year period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately onethird of the program completed as measured in users we expect to implement germany and the united states over the next two years and will then have more than half of the companys users on the system incremental capital expenditures for the blue ocean program are approximately 30 million  annually this amount may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates we expect the return on this investment when complete to include improved realized pricing reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 

intellectual property 

we hold over 4500  patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc “mt” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

risk factors 

tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries continued economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely affect our operating results 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries economic instability in many parts of the world including the potential for a sovereign debt crisis in the european union and the united states continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely concerns regarding this potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets more specifically an escalation of the european debt crisis could have the following adverse effects 

 

        because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in uncertain or difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 

we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in affect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse affect on the global capital markets and more specifically 

on the ability of our company our customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 3886 million  of sales to external customers approximately 30  of our global production and 1209 million  of segment profit during 2011  in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

while business activity in emerging markets improved during 2011  fluctuating economic conditions may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future certain emerging markets have also experienced currency devaluations and inflationary prices economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however fluctuating economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations in these markets 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we 

face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

we are vulnerable to system failures including those that may be related to cyber security attacks which could harm our business 

we rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

we also are in the process of implementing our blue ocean program a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system the implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis over a multi year period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately onethird of the program completed as measured in users we expect to implement germany and the united states over the next two years and will then have more than half of the companys users on the system if the implementation of any unit is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation of blue ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

an interruption in our business due to events such as disruptions with our supply chain natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires or explosions may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our 

profitability 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2011  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4477 million  and other intangible assets of 1214 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a 

governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and recently the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro the average exchange rate between the swiss franc and the euro was 123  during 2011  as compared to 139  for the prior year reflecting a 12  strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro the current exchange rate for the swiss franc to the euro is 121  as of february 8 2012  reflecting a 2  strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2011  we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 16 million  to 22 million  on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2011  we estimate that a 10  weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 44 million  in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2011  we had total indebtedness of approximately 2694 million  net of cash of 2356 million  we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and is subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreement governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 870 million  our credit facility is provided by a group of 16  financial institutions who individually have between 1  and 14  of the total funding commitment at december 31 2011  we had borrowings of 3767 million  outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 870 million  

we make from time to time forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

we from time to time provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “factors affecting our future operating results” in the “business” section and the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of this annual report on form 10k which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forwardlooking statements we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict these new risk factors nor can it assess the impact if any of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 

in providing guidance on our future earnings our management evaluates our budgets our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors some of the key external assumptions include 

 some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no one customer accounts for more than 2  of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

local currency changes exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

overview 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

during 2011  we experienced strong broadbased local currency organic sales growth related to positive global economic conditions and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs net sales in us dollars increased by 17 in 2011  and increased by 14 in 2010  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 13 in 2011  and 14 in 2010  however we expect our local currency organic sales growth to slow during 2012 as global economic forecasts indicate economic growth is expected to slow and we will face more difficult comparisons if the global economy were to fall into recessionary conditions we would expect our sales to be adversely impacted and a year over year decline in sales may occur it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected however we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions diversified customer base robust product offering and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples include identifying and investing in growth opportunities improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes further penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2011  in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies demand from these markets increased during 2011  related to the previously mentioned global economic conditions and benefits from our sales and marketing programs however demand from these markets was partially offset by reduced demand from universities and governmentfunded research institutions in developed markets while we experienced strong business activity in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets during 2011 the global economic environment remains uncertain and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our future results may be adversely affected 

our industrial markets especially coreindustrial products were favorably impacted by strong economic conditions in emerging markets due to increased production capacity for domestic and export markets emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries local currency sales growth in our developed industrial markets during 2011  was also primarily related to positive economic conditions while we experienced strong business activity in our industrialrelated enduser markets during 2011 the global economic environment remains uncertain and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our future results may be adversely affected our industrial products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 

our food retailing markets also experienced increased results during 2011  especially in emerging markets however we did not experience a significant increase in project activity in developed markets during 2011  traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2012  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve abovemarket sales growth by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 34 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 20year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 19 on a compound annual growth basis in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities local currency sales increased in emerging 

markets by 21 during 2011  versus the prior year related to improved global economic conditions sales increases were experienced throughout all markets especially in china we anticipate sales in 2012  will continue to increase as compared to 2011  absent a deterioration in global economic conditions however we expect local currency sales growth to be reduced as global economic forecasts indicate economic growth is expected to slow and we will face more difficult prior period comparisons to reduce costs we also continue to shift more of our manufacturing to china where our four facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 5  of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we significantly reduced our global cost structure during 2009 in response to the global economic slowdown and took further actions during 2011 in response to the continued economic uncertainty we have also focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during the first and third quarters of 2011 we acquired an xray inspection solutions business in the united states and a vision inspection solutions business in germany both of which will be integrated into our endofline product inspection systems offering during the first quarter of 2010 we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom and during the fourth quarter of 2009 we also acquired a leader of vision inspection technology in the united states that has been integrated with our endofline product inspection systems offering 

results of operations — consolidated 

net sales 

net sales were 23093 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 19682 million  in 2010  and 17289 million  in 2009  this represents increases in 2011  and 2010  of 17 and 14 in us dollars and 13 and 14 in local currencies respectively during the first and third quarters of 2011 we acquired an xray inspection business in the united states and a vision inspection solutions business located in germany both of which have been integrated into our endofline product inspection systems offering during the first quarter of 2010 we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom that has been integrated into our uk market organization during the fourth quarter of 2010 we sold our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions we estimate acquisitionsdivestitures net contributed approximately 1 to our net sales growth during 2011  

in 2011  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by 9  in the americas 18  in europe and 26  in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2011  by 9  in the americas 11  in europe and 20  in asiarest of world a discussion of 

sales by operating segment is included below acquisitionsdivestitures net contributed approximately 1 in europe to net sales growth during 2011  while we have experienced improved business activity during 2011  the global economic environment remains uncertain and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

as described in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

net sales of products increased by 20  and 17  in 2011  and 2010  in us dollars and by 15  and 16  in local currencies respectively service revenue including spare parts increased in 2011  and 2010  by 9  and 5  in u s dollars respectively and by 5 in local currencies for both periods 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products which represented approximately 45 of our total net sales in 2011  increased by 14  in us dollars and 9  in local currencies during 2011  principally driven by strong results in analytical instruments process analytics and laboratory balances 

net sales of our industrialrelated products which represented approximately 45 of our total net sales in 2011  increased by 24  in us dollars and 19  in local currencies during 2011  we experienced strong sales growth across most product categories and geographies particularly china acquisitions contributed approximately 3 to our industrialrelated net sales growth during 2011  

net sales in our food retailing markets which represented approximately 10 of our total net sales in 2011  increased by 5  in us dollars and increased 1  in local currencies during 2011  compared to the previous year resulting from strong growth in europe related to increased project activity and china offset in part by decreased sales in the united states food retailing sales during 2011  were reduced by approximately 6 due to product line exits 

gross profit 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 528  for 2011  compared to 527  for 2010  and 514  for 2009  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 563  for 2011  compared to 565  for 2010  and 552  for 2009  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 393  for 2011  compared to 395  for 2010  and 398  for 2009  

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects benefits from increased sales volume pricing favorable mix and operating efficiencies these results were partly offset by unfavorable currency rate changes and increased material costs 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 50  for 2011  49  for 2010  and 52  for 2009  research and development expenses increased by 20  and 8  in 2011  and 2010  respectively in us dollars and in local currencies increased by 9  and 6  in 2011  and 2010  respectively our research and development spending levels reflect changes in part due to the timing of project activity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 305  for 2011  compared to 299  for 2010  and 292  for 2009  selling general and administrative expenses in us dollars increased by 20  and 17  in 2011  and 2010  respectively and in local currencies increased by 13   and 16  in 2011  and 2010  respectively the increase in 2011  is primarily due to increased sales 

and marketing investments especially in emerging markets costs related to our blue ocean program a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system and acquisitionrelated expenses 

restructuring charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a global cost reduction program which has substantially been completed we also initiated additional cost reduction measures in the fourth quarter of 2011 charges under these programs primarily comprise severance costs through december 31 2011  total charges recognized under these programs were 486 million  of which 59 million  49 million  and 314 million  was recognized during 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively see note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2011  

other charges income net 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 24 million  in 2011  compared to net charges of 42 million  and 14 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively other charges income net consists primarily of interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items other charges income net in 2010 also includes a 44 million   38 million  aftertax charge associated with the sale of our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions this amount was partially offset by a benefit from unrealized contingent consideration from a previous acquisition totaling 12 million   12 million  aftertax 

interest expense and taxes 

interest expense was 232 million  for 2011  compared to 201 million  for 2010  and 251 million  for 2009  the increase in interest expense for 2011  is primarily a result of additional borrowings during the fourth quarter 2010 in order to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation the 2010  amount reflects the benefit of lower average borrowings and lower costs associated with our interest rate swap agreements compared with the prior year 

during 2011  2010  and 2009  we recorded discrete tax items resulting in net tax benefits of 38 million  52 million  and 83 million  primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters 

our annual effective tax rate was 23  25  and 23  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 1  in both 2011  and 2010  and 4  in 2009  our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed nonus operations the most significant of these lowertaxed operations are in switzerland and china

segment profit increased 149 million  in our other segment during 2011  compared to a increase of 96 million  during 2010  the increase in segment profit during 2011  relates primarily to increased sales volume 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions in 2010 we increased our debt balance at a european 

owned entity and our cash balance in the united states to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation while we have seen an improvement in global economic conditions our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global economic slowdown 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 2809 million  in 2011  compared to 2683 million  in 2010  and 2326 million  in 2009  the increase in 2011  resulted principally from increased net earnings offset by increased incentive payments of approximately 39 million related to previous year performancerelated compensation incentives as well as increased working capital associated with the increased sales volume and higher tax payments our inventory balances have increased during 2011  related to increased business activity as well as system changes supplier constraints and new product introductions the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2010  resulted principally from higher net earnings offset in part by increased working capital associated with the increased sales volume our inventory balances also increased during 2010  related to increased business activity as well as system changes supplier constraints product transfers and new product introductions in addition benefits during 2010  from reduced incentive payments related to previous year performancerelated compensation incentives were offset by benefits during 2009  from reduced working capital balances associated with the decline in prior year business activity we also made 50 million  and 115 million  of voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2010  and 2009  respectively 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 985 million  in 2011  739 million  in 2010  and 600 million  in 2009  our capital expenditures in 2011  included approximately 557 million  of investments directly related to our blue ocean multiyear program of information technology investment compared with 306 million  in 2010  and 351 million  in 2009  

cash flows used in financing activities during 2011  included repayments and proceeds from borrowings of 4012 million and bank fees of 31 million  associated with our new credit agreement as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1285827 shares and 1955634 shares in the amount of 2046 million  and 2400 million  during 2011  and 2010  respectively cash flows used in financing activities during 2010 also included the repayment of our 75 million 485 senior notes which matured on november 15 2010 the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility cash flows used in financing activities during 2009 included proceeds of 100 million from the issuance of our 630 senior notes and payments of 07 million of debt issuance costs in 2009 we also made payments to repurchase 75 million of our 485 senior notes and paid 16 million in debt extinguishment costs and other financing charges in connection with our tender offer 

as previously mentioned cash flows provided by financing activities during 2010 also reflected increased debt balances at a european owned entity to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation the increase in our credit agreement borrowings from 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to this transaction the transaction also increased cash balances in the us 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in august 2011 we acquired a leader in vision inspection technology for endofline product systems located in germany that will be integrated into our endofline product inspection product offering for an aggregate purchase price of 194 million we may be required to pay additional cash consideration up to a maximum amount of 24 million related to an earnout period we also paid additional contingent cash consideration previously accrued at the time of acquisition of 78 million in the third quarter 2011 related to an earnout associated with an acquisition in 2009 this payment is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during the 

first quarter 2011 we completed acquisitions totaling 154 million of which 120 million related to an xray inspection solutions business that will be integrated into our product inspection product offering 

during the first quarter of 2010 we spent approximately 125 million related to the acquisition of our pipette distributor in the united kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2010 we also sold our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions for approximately 10 million the sale resulted in a 44 million pretax charge 38 million aftertax and has been included in other charges income net in our 2010 consolidated statement of operations annualized net sales and net earnings associated with this business are immaterial to our consolidated results 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested as of december 31 2011  we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested accordingly we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 

630 senior notes 

on june 25 2009  we issued and sold in a private placement 100 million  aggregate principal amount of its 630  series 2009a senior notes due june 25 2015  “ 630 senior notes” under a note purchase agreement among the company and the accredited institutional investors named therein the “agreement” the 630 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 

the 630 senior notes mature on june 25 2015  interest is payable semiannually in june and december we may at any time prepay the 630 senior notes in whole or in part but in an amount not less than 10  of the original aggregate principal amount at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “makewhole” prepayment premium in the event of a change in control of the company as defined in the agreement we may be required to offer to prepay the 630 senior notes in whole at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type including among others limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness disposition of assets mergers and transactions with affiliates the agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10  and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10  the agreement contains customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2011  

under the terms of the offering we may sell additional senior notes at its discretion in an aggregate amount not to exceed 600 million  such additional senior notes would rank equally with our unsecured indebtedness 

issuance costs approximating 07 million  will be amortized to interest expense over the six year term of the 630 senior notes 

tender offer  repayment of 485 senior notes 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million  of 485  unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 “ 485 senior notes” on may 6 2009 we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding 485 senior notes due november 15 2010 the tender offer which expired 

may 12 2009 resulted in the repurchase of 75 million  of the principal balance of the 485 senior notes at maturity on november 15 2010 we repaid the remaining 75 million  outstanding principal balance of our 485 senior notes the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 

credit agreement 

on december 20 2011 we entered into an 870 million credit agreement the credit agreement which replaced our 950 million  amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of december 20 2016 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior consolidated leverage ratio which was as of december 31 2011  set at libor plus 105  basis points we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio the credit agreement contains covenants with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2011  including maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10  and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10  the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default we incurred approximately 03 million  of debt extinguishment costs during 2011 related to the prior credit agreement we capitalized 31 million  in financing fees during 2011 associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through 2016 as of december 31 2011  approximately 4859 million  was available under the facility 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2011  



changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

at december 31 2011  we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our 630 senior notes and credit agreement in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2011  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 



 

 we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

we have a 225 billion  share repurchase program that was increased in november 2010 whereby the board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional 750 million  of common shares we expect that the new authorization will be utilized over the next several years as of december 31 2011  there were 716 million  of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors we have purchased 185 million  shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2011  

during the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  we spent 2046 million  and 2400 million  on the repurchase of 1285827 shares and 1955634 shares at an average price per share of 15908  and 12270  respectively we reissued 450613  and 527276 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2011  and 2010  respectively 

we also reissued 2549 shares held in treasury during 2010  pursuant to its 2007 share plan which extends certain eligible employees the option to receive a percentage of their annual performancebased compensation in shares of the company’s stock there were no  shares reissued related to the 2007 share plan during the year ended december 31 2011  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and recently the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro the average exchange rate between the swiss franc and the euro was 123  during 2011  as compared to 139  for the prior year reflecting a 12  strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro the current exchange rate for the swiss franc to the euro is 121  as of february 8 2012  reflecting a 2  strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2011  we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 16 million  to 22 million  on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2011  we estimate that a 10  weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 44 million  in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

taxes 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo llc “mt” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in 

landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated njdep has informally told mt to expect a claim for natural resource damages “nrd” regarding this site but has not yet made such a claim in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate 05 million  

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 01 million  net gain at december 31 2011  a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar and swiss franc declined by 10  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 44 million  at december 31 2011  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a loss of 92 million  at december 31 2011  based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2011  a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 42 million  conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 38 million  decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2011  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the net periodic pension cost for 2011  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2011  was 44 million  and 1465 million  respectively for our us pension plan and 37 million  and 7175 million  respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2011  and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2011  for our us postretirement medical benefit plan was 03 million  and 133 million  respectively 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2011  the weighted average return on assets assumption was 80  for the us plan and 48  for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 58 million  after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2011  the average discount rate assumption was 425  for the us plan and 310  for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 35 million after tax 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 50 million  and 115 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

equitybased compensation 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

trade accounts receivable 

as of december 31 2011  trade accounts receivable were 4251 million  net of a 123 million  allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

inventories 

as of december 31 2011  inventories were 2414 million  

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2011  our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4477 million  and other intangible assets of 1214 million  

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation for goodwill is generally 

based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we are unable to conclude that a reporting unit is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the evaluation for indefinitelived intangible assets is more quantitative in nature both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic conditions and market data among other factors there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 3492 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  each increase of 35 million  in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

     revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot 

legally transfer before delivery the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented other than a few small software applications the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent the company’s solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed the company defers product revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods andor services these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the companys control the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates time to install and geographic location the adoption of the revised multipleelement arrangement guidance on january 1 2011 has not and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial statements 

further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

warranty 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food and beverage producers food retailers chemical specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic community 

 

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 

 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2 of 2010 net sales 

 

sales and service 

 

market organizations 

 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2010 our sales and service group consisted of approximately 5500 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

 

service 

 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 23 of our net sales in 2010 25 in 2009 and 22 in 2008 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

 

producing organizations 

 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 

research and development 

 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2890 million in research and development 970 million in 2010 897 million in 2009 and 1023 million in 2008 in 2010 we spent approximately 49 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 

  

we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1000 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

 

manufacturing 

 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

 

backlog seasonality 

 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 26 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

employees 

 

our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december 31 2010 was approximately 11200 throughout the world including approximately 4400 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 3800 in asia and other countries 

 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

 

sustainability — greenmt 

 

we have long felt it is important to be an environmentally conscious company we believe this philosophy has lead to a strong recognition in our organization for the importance of the topics and strong track record of environmental consciousness in how we run our business for example our product manufacturing processes are clean and efficient and our products are designed to minimize energy consumption as well as help our customers to be “green” through better yield and reduced waste we want to gain a broader awareness of all the ways our business affects the environment and society and to ensure we are continuously improving our practices in 2010 we initiated a formal program to pursue these ambitions called greenmt greenmt is considered a key strategic program for the company 

 

blue ocean program 

 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes with high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 we expect the incremental capitalized project costs associated with blue ocean to approximate 20 million on an annual basis over the next five years this amount may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates we expect the return on this investment when complete to include reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we hold over 4000 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

 

regulation 

 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration 

fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo inc “mti” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mti oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated njdep has informally told mti to expect a claim for natural resource damages “nrd” regarding this site but has not yet made such a claim in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next six years will approximate 06 million 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

competition 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must 

continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

factors affecting our future operating results 

 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries continued economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely affect our operating results 

 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 2986 million of sales to external customers and 930 million of segment profit during 2010 in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 

  

we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

 

while business activity in emerging markets improved during 2010 fluctuating economic conditions may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future certain emerging markets have also experienced currency devaluations and inflationary prices economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however fluctuating economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations in these markets 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 

we are vulnerable to system failures which could harm our business 

 

we rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

 

we also are in the process of implementing our blue ocean program a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system the implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year period with the initial golive rollout having occurred in 2010 if the implementation of any unit is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation of blue ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

 

an interruption in our business due to events such as disruptions with our supply chain natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires or explosions may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must 

continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

 

in recent years a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu or in the asia pacific region outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2010 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4347 million and other intangible assets of 1044 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the 

value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and recently the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro the exchange rate between the swiss franc and the euro was 139 during 2010 as compared to 151 for the prior year reflecting an 8 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro the current exchange rate for the swiss franc to the euro is 130 as of february 8 2011 reflecting a 6 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2010 we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 11 million to 18 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss 

franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2010 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 95 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

 

we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2010 we had total indebtedness of approximately 2336 million net of cash of 4476 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and is subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreement governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 950 million our credit facility is provided by a group of 20 financial institutions who individually have between 1 and 11 of the total funding commitment at december 31 2010 we had borrowings of 5565 million outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in us being unable to borrow the full 950 million 

we make from time to time forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

 

we from time to time provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “factors affecting our future operating results” in the “business” section and the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of this annual report on form 10k which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forwardlooking statements we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict these new risk factors nor can it assess the impact if any of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 

 

in providing guidance on our future earnings our management evaluates our budgets our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors some of the key external assumptions include 

 

  

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no one customer accounts for more than 2 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 

  

these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

local currency changes exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods we do not nor do we suggest that investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we present nongaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 

 

overview 

 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

 

during 2010 we experienced broadbased sales increases across most geographies and products related to improved global economic conditions we also experienced increased sales during 2010 given the replacement nature of many of our products and the respective deferral of product replacements by our customers during 2009 net sales in us dollars increased by 14 in 2010 and decreased by 12 in 2009 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 14 in 2010 and decreased 10 in 2009 our future sales in local currencies may be adversely affected by weak 

global economic conditions although we also expect to continue to benefit from our strong leadership positions and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs examples include identifying and investing in growth opportunities improving our lead generation and nurturing processes better penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services while we have experienced improved business activity during 2010 the global economic environment remains uncertain and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced increased results during 2010 in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities demand from these markets increased during 2010 related to the previously mentioned improved global economic conditions particularly in asia pacific and the americas 

 

our industrial markets especially coreindustrial products were particularly impacted by improved economic conditions in emerging markets due to increased production capacity for domestic and export markets emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries local currency sales growth in our developed industrial markets during 2010 was also primarily related to improved economic conditions as well as weaker prior period comparisons however market conditions improved more quickly in the americas as compared to europe 

 

in our food retail end markets we also experienced increased results during 2010 related to improved global economic conditions especially in emerging markets however we did not experience a significant increase in project activity in developed markets during 2010 traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

 

in 2011 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve abovemarket sales growth by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and effectiveness and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 31 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 20year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 16 on a compound annual growth basis in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities local currency sales increased in emerging markets by 24 during 2010 versus the prior year related to improved global economic conditions sales increases were experienced throughout all markets especially in china we anticipate sales in 2011 will continue to increase as compared to 2010 absent a deterioration in global economic conditions however we expect local currency sales growth to be 

reduced as 2010 benefited from weaker prior period comparisons to reduce costs we also continue to shift more of our manufacturing to china where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 51 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure for example we significantly reduced our global cost structure during 2009 in response to the recent global economic slowdown we have also focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement as previously mentioned shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

 

pursuing strategic acquisitions we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during the first quarter of 2010 we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom and during the fourth quarter of 2009 we also acquired a leader of vision inspection technology that has been integrated with our endofline packaging inspection systems product offering 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

net sales 

 

net sales were 19682 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 17289 million in 2009 and 19733 million in 2008 in us dollars this represents an increase in 2010 of 14 and a decrease in 2009 of 12 in local currencies net sales increased 14 in 2010 and decreased 10 in 2009 during the fourth quarter of 2009 we acquired a vision technology company that has been integrated into our endofline packaging inspection systems product offering during the first quarter of 2010 we also acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom that has been integrated into our uk market organization we estimate acquisitions contributed approximately 2 to our net sales growth during 2010 

 

in 2010 our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by 16 in the americas 4 in europe and 27 in asiarest of world in local currencies our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2010 by 15 in the americas 7 in europe and 23 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below acquisitions contributed approximately 2 in the americas and 2 in europe to net sales growth during 2010 while we have experienced improved business activity particularly in asiarest of world and the americas the global economic environment remains uncertain and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 

 

as described in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

 

net sales of products increased by 17 in 2010 in us dollars and decreased by 15 in 2009 in local currencies net sales of products increased by 16 in 2010 and decreased by 13 in 2009 service revenue including spare parts increased in 2010 by 5 and decreased in 2009 by 4 in us dollars in local currencies service revenue increased by 5 in 2010 and was flat in 2009 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products increased by 15 in us dollars and in local currencies during 2010 principally driven by strong growth across most product categories and geographies acquisitions contributed approximately 2 to our laboratoryrelated net sales growth during 2010 

 

net sales of our industrialrelated products increased by 15 in us dollars and in local currencies during 2010 we experienced strong sales growth in our product inspection and coreindustrial products net sales growth was offset in part by decreased sales in transportation and logistics products during 2010 net sales growth in industrialrelated products reflects particularly strong growth in china and the americas acquisitions contributed approximately 2 to our industrialrelated net sales growth during 2010 

 

in our food retailing markets net sales increased by 3 in us dollars and increased 5 in local currencies during 2010 compared to the previous year resulting from strong growth in china 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 527 for 2010 compared to 514 for 2009 and 503 for 2008 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 565 for 2010 compared to 552 for 2009 and 542 for 2008 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 395 for 2010 compared to 398 for 2009 and 368 for 2008 

 

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects benefits from increased sales volume and operating efficiencies as well as pricing these results were also partly offset by unfavorable business mix as well as increased material costs including higher costs for certain steelrelated items and unfavorable currency 

 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 49 for 2010 and 52 for both 2009 and 2008 research and development expenses increased by 8 and decreased by 12 in us dollars in 2010 and 2009 respectively and in local currencies increased by 6 in 2010 and decreased by 11 in 2009 our research and development spending levels reflect increased research and development investments across most product categories 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 299 for 2010 compared to 292 for 2009 and 294 for 2008 selling general and administrative expenses in us dollars increased by 17 in 2010 and decreased by 13 in 2009 and in local currencies increased by 16 in 2010 and decreased by 11 in 2009 the increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher performancerelated compensation costs and increased sales and marketing activities related to the improved economic environment as well as acquisitionrelated expenses the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to benefits from our cost reduction activities and reduced performancerelated compensation costs 

 

restructuring charges 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a global cost reduction program which has substantially been completed charges under the program primarily comprise severance costs through december 31 2010 total charges recognized were 427 million of which 49 million 314 million and 64 million was recognized during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during 2010 

 

other charges income net 

 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 42 million in 2010 compared to net charges of 14 million and 26 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively other charges income net consists primarily of interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items other charges income 

net in 2010 also includes a 44 million 38 million aftertax charge associated with the sale of our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions this amount was partially offset by a benefit from unrealized contingent consideration from a previous acquisition totaling 12 million 12 million aftertax 

 

interest expense and taxes 

 

interest expense was 201 million for 2010 compared to 251 million for 2009 and 254 million for 2008 the 2010 amount reflects the benefit of lower average borrowings and lower costs associated with our interest rate swap agreements compared with the prior year the 2009 amount includes charges associated with the tender offer of our 485 senior notes and other financing costs as well as costs associated with our interest rate swap agreements which were offset by lower average debt balances in comparison to 2008 

 

during 2010 we recorded discrete tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of 52 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters in 2009 we recorded a discrete net tax benefit of 83 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters during 2008 we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 25 million related to favorable withholding tax law changes in china and discrete tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of 35 million primarily related to the closure of certain tax matters 

 

our annual effective tax rate was 25 23 and 24 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 1 in 2010 4 in 2009 and 2 in 2008

segment profit increased by 157 million in our us operations segment during 2010 compared to a decrease of 59 million during 2009 the increase in segment profit in 2010 was primarily due to increased sales volume as well as benefits from our cost reduction efforts and acquisitions offset in part by increased material costs and a 18 million gain recognized during 2009 from the receipt of a previously reserved receivable

segment profit increased by 162 million in our swiss operations segment during 2010 compared to a decrease of 48 million during 2009 the increase in segment profit during 2010 is primarily due to increased sales volume and increased intersegment pricing partially offset by increased sales and marketing investments

segment profit increased 93 million in our other segment during 2010 compared to a decrease of 52 million during 2009 the increase in segment profit during 2010 relates primarily to increased sales volume 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions in 2010 we have also increased our debt balance at a european owned entity and our cash balance in the united states to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation our share repurchase program was suspended in october 2008 and restarted in december 2009 due to the economic downturn and instability in the financial markets while we have seen an improvement in global economic conditions our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global economic slowdown 

 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 2683 million in 2010 compared to 2326 million in 2009 and 2231 million in 2008 the increase in 2010 resulted principally from higher net earnings offset in part by increased working capital associated with the increased sales volume our inventory balances have also increased during 2010 related to increased business activity as well as supplier constraints system changes product transfers and new product introductions in addition benefits during 2010 from reduced incentive payments related to previous year performancerelated compensation incentives were offset by benefits during 2009 from reduced working capital balances associated with the decline in prior year business activity the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted principally from decreased incentive payments of 154 million related to 2008 performancerelated compensation incentives and reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances offset in part by lower net earnings and cash payments of 222 million related to our restructuring program we also made 50 million 115 million and 50 million of voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 739 million in 2010 600 million in 2009 and 610 million in 2008 our capital expenditures in 2010 included approximately 306 million of investments directly related to our blue ocean multiyear program of information technology investment compared with 351 million in 2009 and 162 million in 2008 

 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2010 included the repayment of our 75 million 485 senior notes which matured on november 15 2010 the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility cash flows used in financing activities during 2009 included proceeds of 100 million from the issuance of our 630 senior notes and payments of 07 million of debt issuance costs in 2009 we also made payments to repurchase 75 million of our 485 senior notes and paid 16 million in debt extinguishment costs and other financing charges in connection with our tender offer financing activities during 2008 included 33 million of financing fees related to the closing of our 950 million credit facility as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we repurchased 1955634 shares and 58800 shares in the amount of 2400 million and 60 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

as previously mentioned cash flows provided by financing activities during 2010 also reflected increased debt balances at a european owned entity to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation the increase in our credit agreement from 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to this transaction the transaction also increased cash balances in the us 

 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness during the first quarter of 2010 we spent approximately 125 million relating to the acquisition of our pipette distributor in the united kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2009 we also spent approximately 143 million plus contingent consideration up to a maximum of 78 million for a leader in vision technology that we have integrated into our endofline packaging inspection systems product offering 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we also sold our retail software business for instore item and inventory management solutions for approximately 10 million the sale resulted in a 44 million pretax charge 38 million aftertax and has been included in other charges income net in our 2010 consolidated statement of operations annualized net sales and net earnings associated with this business are immaterial to our consolidated results 

 

630 senior notes 

 

on june 25 2009 we issued and sold in a private placement 100 million aggregate principal amount of our 630 series 2009a senior notes due june 25 2015 “630 senior notes” under a note purchase agreement among the company and the accredited institutional investors named therein the “agreement” the 630 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 

 

the 630 senior notes mature on june 25 2015 interest is payable semiannually in june and december we may at any time prepay the 630 senior notes in whole or in part but in an amount not less than 10 of the original aggregate principal amount at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “makewhole” prepayment premium in the event of a change in control of the company as defined in the agreement we may be required to offer to prepay the 630 senior notes in whole at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

 

the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type including among others limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness disposition of assets mergers and transactions with affiliates the agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 the agreement contains customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2010 

under the terms of the offering we may sell additional senior notes at our discretion in an aggregate amount not to exceed 600 million such additional senior notes would rank equally with our unsecured indebtedness 

 

issuance costs approximating 07 million will be amortized to interest expense over the sixyear term of the 630 senior notes 

 

tender offer  repayment of 485 senior notes 

 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 “485 senior notes” discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and were amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the 485 senior notes 

 

on may 6 2009 we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding 485 senior notes due november 15 2010 the tender offer which expired may 12 2009 resulted in the repurchase of 75 million of the principal balance of the 485 senior notes in connection with the tender we recorded a charge of 15 million which included a premium of 09 million unamortized discount and debt issuance fees of 02 million and certain third party costs of 04 million these charges were recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

at maturity on november 15 2010 we repaid the remaining 75 million outstanding principal balance of our 485 senior notes the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 

 

credit agreement 

 

on august 15 2008 we entered into a 950 million credit agreement the “credit agreement” which replaced our 450 million amended and restated credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of august 15 2013 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings which was as of december 31 2010 set at libor plus 070 based on ratings of “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa2” by moody’s we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the credit agreement contains covenants with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2010 which include maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control we capitalized 33 million in financing fees during 2008 associated with the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2013 as of december 31 2010 approximately 3879 million was available under the facility 

 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2010 

 

 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

 

at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our 630 senior notes and credit agreement in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

 

we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 

 

 

 

  

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans

we have a 225 billion share repurchase program that was increased in november 2010 whereby the board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional 750 million of common shares we expect that the new authorization will be utilized over the next several years as of december 31 2010 there were 9206 million of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions the level of acquisition activity and other factors we have purchased 172 million shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2010 

 

our share repurchase program was suspended in october 2008 and restarted in december 2009 during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we spent 2400 million and 60 million on the repurchase of 1955634 shares and 58800 shares at an average price per share of 12270 and 10182 respectively we 

reissued 527276 shares and 308154 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we also reissued 2549 shares and 6467 shares held in treasury during 2010 and 2009 respectively pursuant to our 2007 share plan which extends certain eligible employees the option to receive a percentage of their annual performancerelated compensation in shares of the company’s stock 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

 

effect of currency on results of operations 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland in addition we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses therefore when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and recently the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro the exchange rate between the swiss franc and the euro was 139 during 2010 as compared to 151 for the prior year reflecting an 8 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro the current exchange rate for the swiss franc to the euro is 130 as of february 8 2011 reflecting a 6 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2010 we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 11 million to 18 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific the united kingdom eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2010 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 95 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

taxes 

 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors 

we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities a former subsidiary of mettlertoledo inc “mti” known as hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” in an administrative consent order “aco” signed on june 13 1988 to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in landing new jersey after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations hispeed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area “cea” which njdep has approved and within which mti oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated njdep has informally told mti to expect a claim for natural resource damages “nrd” regarding this site but has not yet made such a claim in 2010 testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next six years will approximate 06 million 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

inflation 

 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 15 million net gain at december 31 2010 a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 73 million at december 31 2010 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may 

overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a loss of 58 million at december 31 2010 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2010 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 48 million conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 51 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2010 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the net periodic pension cost for 2010 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2010 was 51 million and 1253 million respectively for our us pension plan and 58 million and 6610 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement credit for 2010 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2010 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan was 04 million and 146 million respectively 

 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2010 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 825 for the us plan and 520 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 59 million after tax 

 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2010 the average discount rate assumption was 550 for the us plan and 

390 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 15 million after tax 

 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 50 million 115 million and 50 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

 

equitybased compensation 

 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 

trade accounts receivable 

 

as of december 31 2010 trade accounts receivable were 3689 million net of a 115 million allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

 

inventories 

 

as of december 31 2010 inventories were 2171 million 

 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2010 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4347 million and other intangible assets of 1044 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth 

perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and we currently believe that there will be no additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other than withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently invested 

 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 3075 million for the year ended december 31 2010 each increase of 31 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to our distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

 

warranty 

 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated endofline inspection systems eg for use in food processing and packaging pharmaceutical and other industries we are a leading global provider of metal detectors xray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection helps detect nonmetallic contamination such as glass stones and pits which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons our xray systems can also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics both xray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines we also provide vision inspection solutions that provide inline inspection of package quality and content and enable our customers to implement traceability and serialization tracking which are needs for food and beverage consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies freeweighnet is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling monitors weightrelated data and integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise resource planning andor process control systems 

 

retail weighing solutions 

 

supermarkets hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods such as meats vegetables fruits and cheeses we offer standalone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing in addition we offer networked scales and software which can integrate backroom counter selfservice and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management 

system customer benefits are in the areas of pricing merchandising inventory management and regulatory compliance our instruments have been expanded to allow instore marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale the retail business accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in 2009 and 13 in both 2008 and 2007 

 

retail software 

 

our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for instore item and inventory management solutions softechnics’ offerings complement our retail weighing solutions to food retailers by providing the full scope of realtime item management retailers can then match local store inventory levels with local customer demand our instruments have been expanded to allow instore marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale 

 

customers and distribution 

 

our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food and beverage producers food retailers chemical specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic community 

 

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 

 

we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1 of 2009 net sales 

 

sales and service 

 

market organizations 

 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2009 our sales and services group consisted of approximately 5300 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

 

service 

 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs 

and replacement parts accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in 2009 22 in 2008 and 23 in 2007 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

 

research and development and manufacturing 

 

producing organizations 

 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 

research and development 

 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2843 million in research and development 897 million in 2009 1023 million in 2008 and 924 million in 2007 in 2009 we spent approximately 52 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 

  

we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have approximately 1000 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

 

manufacturing 

 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

 

backlog seasonality 

 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 26 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

 

employees 

 

our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december 31 2009 was approximately 10400 throughout the world including approximately 4100 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 3300 in asia and other countries 

 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

 

blue ocean program 

 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes with high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year period with the initial golive rollout occurring in early 2010 we expect capitalized project costs in the first phase to exceed 100 million and expect our annual capital expenditures will continue to be approximately 60 million until blue ocean is completed these amounts may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates we expect the return on this investment when complete to include reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we hold over 3500 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

 

regulation 

 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities our former subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 05 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

competition 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets 

competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors affecting our future operating results 

 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries the current economic downturns or recessions in these countries may continue to adversely affect our operating results 

 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results during 2009 we have experienced significant decreases and delays in customer expenditures which may continue and possibly worsen customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 2326 million of sales to external customers and 694 million of segment profit in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 

  

we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

 

economic conditions in emerging markets deteriorated significantly during 2009 and experienced recessionary trends particularly in eastern europe certain emerging markets have also experienced severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect fluctuating economic conditions may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

 

an interruption in our business due to events such as natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires explosions or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

 

a number of countries have recently experienced outbreaks of the h1n1 influenza swine flu a number of countries in the asia pacific region have also experienced outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu in recent years despite the implementation of certain precautions we are susceptible to such outbreaks as a result of such outbreaks businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are vulnerable to system failures which could harm our business 

 

we rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

 

we also are in the process of implementing our blue ocean program a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system the implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year period with the initial golive rollout occurring in early 2010 if the implementation of any unit is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned for and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies in addition the implementation of blue ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 

 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2009 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4410 million and other intangible assets of 1053 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense the determination of the 

value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with us gaap our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor in recent years we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 11 million to 14 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific eastern europe 

latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2009 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 71 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2009 we had total indebtedness of approximately 2085 million net of cash of 850 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

 

the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 

 

in the current difficult environment our creditors can be expected to strictly enforce the terms of our debt instruments although we believe we are currently in compliance with all requirements under the agreements governing our debt if we fail to comply in the future with a requirement our access to our credit facility and ability to borrow further may be limited in such circumstances we may not be able to refinance our existing debt or only be able to do so at significantly higher costs 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the indenture and note purchase agreement governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 

 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and are subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture or note purchase agreement governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

 

the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 

 

we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to 950 million our credit facility is provided by a group of 20 financial institutions who individually have between 1 and 11 of the total funding commitment at december 31 2009 we had borrowings of 911 million outstanding under our credit facility our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available 

even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations this could result in the company being unable to borrow the full 950 million 

 

we make from time to time forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 

 

we from time to time provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “factors affecting our future operating results” in the “business” section and the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of this annual report on form 10k which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forwardlooking statements we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict these new risk factors nor can it assess the impact if any of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 

 

in providing guidance on our future earnings our management evaluates our budgets our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors some of the key external assumptions include 

 

  

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no one customer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 

  

these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will 

generate adequate cost savings additionally it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

 

our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control 

 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

 

during 2009 we experienced broadbased sales declines across most geographies and products related to adverse global economic conditions net sales in us dollars decreased by 12 in 2009 and increased by 10 in 2008 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales decreased 10 in 2009 and increased 6 in 2008 our future sales in local currencies may continue to be adversely affected by weak global economic conditions although we also expect to continue to benefit from our strong leadership positions and the impact of our global sales and marketing initiatives examples include identifying and investing in growth opportunities improving our lead generation and nurturing processes better penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services while we believe previous year financial comparisons will improve during 2010 it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected in this uncertain environment 

 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced decreased results during 2009 in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities demand from these markets decreased during 2009 related to the previously mentioned global economic slowdown particularly in the americas and europe 

our industrial markets especially coreindustrial products were particularly impacted negatively by the global economic slowdown due to reduced production capacity for domestic and export markets reduced demand in our industrial markets was experienced globally including in our emerging markets emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to lowcost countries local currency sales growth in our industrial emerging markets improved during the fourth quarter of 2009 and we anticipate future sales in emerging markets will continue to improve as compared to 2009 absent a further deterioration in global economic conditions however we expect reduced demand in our developed industrial markets may continue during 2010 

 

in our food retail end markets we also experienced decreased results during 2009 related to the global economic slowdown as well as strong project activity in europe during the previous year traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 

 

in 2010 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve abovemarket sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 28 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 20year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 15 on a compound annual growth basis in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities local currency sales declined in emerging markets by 7 during 2009 versus the prior year related to weak global economic conditions sales declines were experienced in most countries especially in eastern europe our chinese industrial business also declined during 2009 due to reduced demand in domestic and export markets local currency sales growth in emerging markets improved during the fourth quarter of 2009 and we anticipate future sales will continue to improve as compared to 2009 absent a further deterioration in global economic conditions to reduce costs we also continue to shift more of our manufacturing to china where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent approximately 52 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base we recently introduced quantos our new automated powder dosing solution for small sample sizes which is controlled and monitored by the laboratory balance 

maintaining cost leadership in response to the global economic slowdown we initiated a global cost reduction program which has resulted in annualized savings of approximately 100 million these savings are the result of reduced spending levels in most cost categories and also include workforce reductions including employees and temporary personnel of approximately 1000 or 10 of our total workforce we also continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure as previously mentioned shifting production to china has been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

 

pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions we also continue to pursue “bolton” acquisitions for example during the first quarter of 2010 we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom and during the fourth quarter of 2009 we also acquired a leader of vision inspection technology that we will integrate with our endofline packaging inspection systems product offering 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

net sales 

 

net sales were 17289 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 19733 million in 2008 and 17937 million in 2007 in us dollars this represents a decrease in 2009 of 12 and an increase in 2008 of 10 in local currencies net sales decreased 10 in 2009 and increased 6 in 2008 

 

in 2009 our net sales by geographic destination decreased in local currencies by 11 in the americas 14 in europe and 2 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

 

as described in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

 

net sales of products decreased by 15 in 2009 in us dollars and increased by 10 in 2008 in local currencies net sales of products decreased by 13 in 2009 and increased by 7 in 2008 service revenue including spare parts decreased in 2009 by 4 and increased in 2008 by 8 in us dollars in local currencies service revenue was flat in 2009 and increased by 5 in 2008 

 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products decreased by 7 in local currencies during 2009 principally driven by a sales decline in most product categories in europe and the americas 

 

net sales of our industrialrelated products decreased by 12 in local currencies during 2009 we experienced a significant decline in sales across most geographies and product categories especially our coreindustrial products 

 

in our food retailing markets net sales decreased by 15 in local currencies during 2009 compared to the previous year primarily due to decreased sales in the us and europe the decline in europe was partly related to strong project activity in 2008 

 

as discussed above global economic conditions continue to be uncertain while we believe prior period comparisons will improve during 2010 it remains difficult to predict the extent to which our future results may be adversely affected in this uncertain environment 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 514 for 2009 compared to 503 for 2008 and 500 for 2007 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 552 for 2009 compared to 542 for 2008 and 538 for 2007 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 398 for 2009 compared to 368 for 2008 and 369 for 2007 

 

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects benefits from reduced material costs increased pricing and favorable product mix these benefits were partially offset by the negative impact of decreased sales volume in excess of our reduced production costs 

 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 52 for both 2009 and 2008 and 51 for 2007 research and development expenses decreased by 11 in 2009 and increased by 4 in 2008 in local currencies our research and development spending levels reflect reduced project activity and the impact of our cost reduction program 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 292 for 2009 compared to 294 for 2008 and 295 for 2007 selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 11 in 2009 and increased by 5 in 2008 in local currencies the decrease is primarily due to benefits from our cost reduction activities and reduced performancerelated compensation bonus and commission costs the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to increased sales and marketing investments especially in china and other emerging market countries and expenses associated with product launches selling general and administrative expenses during 2008 also included severance expense partially offset by a gain associated with an asset sale 

 

other charges income net 

 

other charges income net consisted of net charges of 328 million in 2009 compared to net charges of 90 million in 2008 and other income net of 09 million in 2007 other charges income net consisted primarily of restructuring charges interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items other charges income net in 2009 and 2008 includes restructuring charges of 314 million and 64 million respectively related to our global cost reduction program as further described below other charges income net for 2008 compared to 2007 was also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and reduced interest income associated with lower cash balances 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a global cost reduction program during the first quarter of 2009 we revised the program to include further cost reductions charges under the program primarily comprise severance costs of approximately 40 million of which 314 million was recorded in other charges income net during the year ended december 31 2009 and 64 million was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2008 under the program our workforce including employees and temporary personnel has been reduced by approximately 1000 as a result of the reduction in workforce our personnel costs will be reduced by approximately 65 million on an annual basis we expect total cost savings from our global cost reduction program to be approximately 100 million on an annual basis 

 

interest expense and taxes 

 

interest expense was 251 million for 2009 compared to 254 million for 2008 and 210 million for 2007 the 2009 amount includes charges associated with the tender offer of our 485 senior notes and other financing costs as well as costs associated with our interest rate swap agreements these costs were offset by lower average debt balances the increase in 2008 is due primarily to increased borrowings compared to 2007 

during 2009 we recorded a discrete net tax benefit of 83 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters in 2008 we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 25 million related to favorable withholding tax law changes in china and discrete tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of 35 million primarily related to the closure of certain tax matters during 2007 we recorded certain discrete tax items that resulted in a net tax benefit of 11 million the discrete items include a benefit of 34 million related to a favorable resolution of certain tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years which were partially offset by a charge of 23 million primarily due to a tax law change in germany 

 

our annual effective tax rate was 23 24 and 27 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 4 in 2009 and 2 in 2008 

 

results of operations — by operating segment 

 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

us operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

the decrease in total net sales and net sales to external customers during 2009 reflects declines across most product categories related to the global economic slowdown particularly coreindustrial and food retailing products 

 

segment profit decreased by 54 million in our us operations segment during 2009 compared to an increase of 85 million during 2008 the decrease in segment profit in 2009 was primarily due to a decline in sales volume offset in part by benefits from our cost reduction efforts we also recorded a 18 million gain from the receipt of a previously reserved note receivable during 2009 

 

swiss operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency decreased by 11 in 2009 and increased by 2 in 2008 net sales to external customers in local currency decreased by 15 in 2009 and increased by 4 in 2008 the decrease in sales to external customers during 2009 reflects declines across most product categories related to the global economic slowdown especially food retailing products analytical instruments and coreindustrial products 

segment profit decreased by 24 million in our swiss operations segment during 2009 compared to an increase of 59 million during 2008 the decrease in segment profit during 2009 reflects the decline in sales and unfavorable currency translation fluctuations offset in part by benefits from our cost reduction efforts 

 

western european operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency decreased by 9 in 2009 and increased by 6 in 2008 net sales to external customers in local currency decreased by 10 in 2009 and increased by 5 in 2008 the decrease in 2009 reflects declines across most product categories related to the global economic slowdown particularly coreindustrial and retail products 

 

segment profit increased by 13 million in our western european operations segment during 2009 compared to an increase of 110 million in 2008 the increase in segment profit in 2009 reflects benefits from our cost reduction efforts and favorable currency translation fluctuations partially offset by the decline in sales volume in addition our western european operations incurred severance expense of 51 million during 2008 

 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency decreased by 6 in 2009 and increased by 14 in 2008 net sales to external customers in local currency was flat in 2009 and increased by 24 in 2008 the change in 2009 total net sales reflects declines in sales of coreindustrial products partially offset by sales growth in our laboratory and product inspection products total net sales growth in local currency increased 14 during the fourth quarter of 2009 and we anticipate improved sales during 2010 as compared to 2009 absent a further deterioration in global economic conditions 

 

segment profit increased by 104 million in our chinese operations segment during 2009 compared to an increase of 15 million in 2008 the increase in segment profit in 2009 is primarily due to benefits from our cost reduction efforts partially offset by decreased sales 

other amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency decreased by 13 in 2009 and increased by 9 in 2008 net sales to external customers in local currency decreased 13 in 2009 and increased 9 in 2008 this performance primarily reflects decreased sales in eastern european canada and japan 

 

segment profit decreased 52 million in our other segment during 2009 compared to a decrease of 11 million during 2008 the decrease in segment profit during 2009 relates primarily to declines in net sales especially in eastern european offset in part by benefits from our cost reductions efforts 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions in light of the economic downturn and instability in the financial markets we have taken a more conservative posture towards the utilization of our cash flow and capital structure this included the suspension of our share repurchase program in october 2008 which was restarted in december 2009 global economic conditions continue to be uncertain and our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global economic slowdown 

 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 2326 million in 2009 compared to 2231 million in 2008 and 2277 million in 2007 the increase in 2009 resulted principally from decreased incentive payments of 154 million related to 2008 performancerelated compensation incentives bonus payments and reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances offset in part by lower net earnings and cash payments of 222 million related to our restructuring program the decrease in 2008 resulted principally from reduced accounts payable balances of 159 million from the beginning of the year versus increased balances of 264 million during the previous year which was largely attributable to strong december 2007 business activity the decrease in 2008 cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to higher payments of approximately 109 million related to 2007 performancerelated compensation incentives bonus payments that were paid during 2008 and the timing of tax disbursements of 219 million these items were offset in part by higher net earnings of 243 million compared to the corresponding period in 2007 we also made 115 million 50 million and 77 million of voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 600 million in 2009 610 million in 2008 and 475 million in 2007 our capital expenditures in 2009 included approximately 351 million of investments directly related to our blue ocean multiyear program of information technology investment compared with 162 million in 2008 and 50 million in 2007 our capital expenditures in 2007 included 71 million of investments related to our new chinese facility we expect that our annual capital expenditures will continue to be approximately 60 million until blue ocean is completed these amounts may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2009 included proceeds of 100 million from the issuance of our 630 senior notes and payments of 07 million of debt issuance costs we also made payments to repurchase 75 million of our 485 senior notes and paid 16 million in debt extinguishment costs and 

other financing charges in connection with our tender offer cash flows used in financing activities during 2008 included 33 million of financing fees related to the closing of our 950 million credit facility during 2008 as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we purchased 58800 shares and 2232188 shares in the amount of 60 million and 2245 million during 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness during the fourth quarter of 2009 we spent approximately 143 million plus contingent consideration up to a maximum of 78 million for a leader in vision technology that we will integrate into our endofline packaging inspection systems product offering during the first quarter of 2010 we also spent approximately 125 million plus contingent consideration up to a maximum of 20 million relating to the acquisition of our pipette distributor in the uk 

 

issuance of 630 senior notes 

 

on june 25 2009 we issued and sold in a private placement 100 million aggregate principal amount of our 630 series 2009a senior notes due june 25 2015 “630 senior notes” under a note purchase agreement among the company and the accredited institutional investors named therein the “agreement” the 630 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 

 

the 630 senior notes mature on june 25 2015 interest is payable semiannually in june and december we may at any time prepay the 630 senior notes in whole or in part but in an amount not less than 10 of the original aggregate principal amount at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “makewhole” prepayment premium in the event of a change in control as defined in the agreement of the company we may be required to offer to prepay the 630 senior notes in whole at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

 

the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type including among others limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness disposition of assets mergers and transactions with affiliates the agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 the agreement contains customary events of default with customary grace periods as applicable the company was in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2009 

 

under the terms of the offering we may sell additional senior notes at our discretion in an aggregate amount not to exceed 600 million such additional senior notes would rank equally with our unsecured indebtedness 

 

issuance costs approximating 07 million will be amortized to interest expense over the sixyear term of the 630 senior notes 

 

485 senior notes  tender offer 

 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 “485 senior notes” the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

 

at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

 

 31 

 

the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

 

on may 6 2009 we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding 485 senior notes due november 15 2010 the tender offer which expired may 12 2009 resulted in the repurchase of 75 million of the principal balance of the 485 senior notes in connection with the tender we recorded a charge of 15 million which included a premium of 09 million unamortized discount and debt issuance fees of 02 million and certain third party costs of 04 million these changes were recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

credit agreement 

 

on august 15 2008 we entered into a 950 million credit agreement the “credit agreement” which replaced our 450 million amended and restated credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of august 15 2013 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings which was as of december 31 2009 set at libor plus 070 based on ratings of “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa2” by moody’s we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the credit agreement contains covenants with which the company was in compliance as of december 31 2009 which include maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 35 to 10 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control we capitalized 33 million in financing fees during 2008 associated with the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2013 as of december 31 2009 approximately 8534 million was available under the facility 

 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2009 

 

 

 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

 

at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our 630 senior notes 485 senior notes and credit agreement in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

 

we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 

 

 

 

  

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 

share repurchase program 

 

we have a share repurchase program that was announced in 2004 under the program we have been authorized to buy back up to 15 billion of the company’s common shares as of december 31 2009 there were 4106 million of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the plan by december 31 2010 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors in light of the economic downturn and instability in the financial markets we have taken a more conservative posture towards the utilization of our cash flow and capital structure this included the suspension of our share repurchase program in october 2008 which was restarted in december 2009 we have purchased 153 million shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2009 

 

during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we spent 60 million and 2245 million on the repurchase of 58800 shares and 2232188 shares at an average price per share of 10182 and 10055 respectively in addition 52 million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december 31 2007 were cash settled during 2008 we reissued 263750 shares and 139780 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we also reissued 6467 shares and 16760 shares held in treasury during 2009 and 2008 respectively pursuant to our 2007 share plan which extends certain eligible employees the option to receive a percentage of their annual bonus in shares of the company’s stock 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

 

effect of currency on results of operations 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor in recent years we have seen higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and the swiss franc has strengthened against the euro we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 11 million to 14 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2009 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 71 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

taxes 

 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our former subsidiary hispeed was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that njdep signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be 

monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 05 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

inflation 

 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was a 17 million gain at december 31 2009 a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 15 million at december 31 2009 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net gain of 35 million at december 31 2009 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2009 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 88 million conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 93 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2009 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the net periodic pension cost for 2009 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2009 was 48 million and 1199 million respectively for our us pension plans and 108 million and 6001 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2009 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2009 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan was 02 million and 145 million respectively 

 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2009 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 825 for the us plan and 515 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 51 million after tax 

 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2009 the average discount rate assumption was 625 for the us plans and 395 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 13 million after tax 

 

we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 115 million 50 million and 77 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively to increase the funded status of our pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

 

equitybased compensation 

 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which are accounted for and recognized in the 

consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 

trade accounts receivable 

 

as of december 31 2009 trade accounts receivable were 3130 million net of a 124 million allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

 

inventories 

 

as of december 31 2009 inventories were 1680 million 

 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2009 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4410 million and other intangible assets of 1053 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and we currently believe that there will be no additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other than withholding taxes all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently invested 

 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 2248 million for the year ended december 31 2009 each increase of 22 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon title transfer and risk of loss to our distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented 

 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

 

warranty 

 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting 

a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated endofline inspection systems eg for use in food processing and packaging pharmaceutical and other industries we are a leading global provider of metal detectors xray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection helps detect nonmetallic contamination such as glass stones and pits which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons our xray systems can also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics both xray and metal detection systems may 

be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines freeweighnet is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling monitors weightrelated data and integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise resource planning andor process control systems 

 

retail weighing solutions 

 

supermarkets hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods such as meats vegetables fruits and cheeses we offer standalone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing in addition we offer networked scales and software which can integrate backroom counter selfservice and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system customer benefits are in the areas of pricing merchandising inventory management and regulatory compliance our instruments have been expanded to allow instore marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale the retail business accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in both 2008 and 2007 and 14 in 2006 

 

retail software 

 

our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for instore item and inventory management solutions softechnics’ offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food retailers by providing the full scope of realtime item management retailers can then match local store inventory levels with local customer demand our instruments have been expanded to allow instore marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale 

 

customers and distribution 

 

our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food and beverage producers food retailers chemical specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic community 

 

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products target markets such as the educational market in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 1 of 2008 net sales 

 

sales and service 

 

market organizations 

 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are customerfocused with an emphasis on building and maintaining valueadded relationships with customers in our target market segments each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2008 our sales and services group consisted of over 5600 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales 

technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

 

service 

 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22 of our total net sales in 2008 and 23 in both 2007 and 2006 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

 

research and development and manufacturing 

 

producing organizations 

 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 

research and development 

 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2775 million in research and development 1023 million in 2008 924 million in 2007 and 828 million in 2006 in 2008 we spent approximately 52 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 

  

we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 1000 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 

 

manufacturing 

 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we 

emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

 

backlog seasonality 

 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 26 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 10000 employees throughout the world including approximately 4500 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 2500 in asia and other countries 

 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

 

blue ocean program 

 

“blue ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized automated and integrated processes with high levels of global data transparency it will encompass a new enterprise architecture with a global single instance erp system within our it systems we are moving toward integrated homogeneous applications and common data structures we will also largely standardize our key business processes the implementation of the systems and processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year period with the initial golive rollout expected to occur in 2010 we expect capitalized project costs in the first phase to exceed 100 million we expect the return on this investment when complete to be reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we hold over 3500 patents and trademarks including pending applications primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom italy france japan china south korea brazil and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities our former subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 06 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

competition 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets 

who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors affecting our future operating results 

 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries the current economic downturns or recessions in these countries can be expected to adversely affect our operating results 

 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries would likely adversely affect our operating results given the current economic uncertainty we are starting to see both decreases and delays in customer expenditures and we expect these to continue and possibly worsen customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 2289 million of sales to external customers and 590 million of segment profit in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 

  

we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

 

economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are currently experiencing recessionary trends severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices moreover economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets even where economies are currently growing such as china we are already seeing significant slowdowns compared with historical growth rates and believe economic conditions in these markets will decline further we remain committed to emerging markets 

particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

 

an interruption in our business due to events such as natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires explosions or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 

a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 

 

a number of countries in the asia pacific region have experienced outbreaks of sars andor avian influenza bird flu in recent years as a result of such an outbreak businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these particularly in north america europe china or other locations significant to our operations could adversely affect general commercial activity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects if our operations are curtailed because of health issues we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers each of which would affect our results of operations in addition a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products further if our customers’ businesses are affected by health issues they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are vulnerable to system failures which could harm our business 

 

we rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services support our customers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality a significant number of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial condition we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 

 

we also recently initiated our “blue ocean” program a program to standardize our global business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a companywide enterprise resource planning system the implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis over a severalyear period with the initial golive rollouts expected to occur during 2010 if the implementation of any unit is flawed we could suffer interruptions in operations and customerfacing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition lose data experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned for and the project may cost us more than we have estimated either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies 

 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results and some industries are already experiencing significant economic declines such as the chemical industry in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 

 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors 

may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2008 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4244 million and other intangible assets of 963 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we might incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 

the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company in recent months we have seen substantially higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and the swiss franc has strengthened significantly against the euro we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 10 million to 14 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2008 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 50 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2008 we had total indebtedness of approximately 3760 million net of cash of 781 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

 

our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt 

 

in the current difficult environment banks can be expected to strictly enforce the terms of our credit agreement although we believe we are currently in compliance with all credit agreement requirements if we fail to comply in the future with a requirement our access to the facility and ability to borrow further may be limited in such circumstances we may not be able to refinance our existing debt or only be able to do so at significantly higher costs 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios 

 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and are subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under our credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

 

we make from time to time forwardlooking statements and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors  

 

we from time to time provide forwardlooking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls including guidance on anticipated earnings per share these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions “factors affecting our future operating results” in the “business” section and the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of this annual report on form 10k which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forwardlooking statements we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict these new risk factors nor can it assess the impact if any of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ 

materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 

 

in providing guidance on our future earnings our management evaluates our budgets our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors some of the key external assumptions include 

 

  

some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time for example although no one customer accounts for more than 1 of our revenues if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently it could have an impact on our results of operations 

 

some of our key internal assumptions include the following 

 

  

these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time for example with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets in certain markets such as emerging markets price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products furthermore we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will be effective or that we will be able to execute them in the estimated time frames additionally although we have included certain restructuring costs in our forecast it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 

 

we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes however should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience results different than our projections 

 

our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control 

 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

 

net sales in us dollars increased by 10 and 12 in 2008 and 2007 respectively excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 6 and 8 in 2008 and 2007 respectively we experienced relatively broadbased sales growth across most geographies and products during 2008 our growth was attributable to positive economic conditions during the first nine months of the year as well as our strong leadership positions and the impact of our global sales and marketing initiatives for example we continue to improve our lead generation and nurturing processes better penetrate our market segments and more effectively price our products and services however global economic conditions weakened during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in reduced sales growth in local currencies in most geographies during the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the prior year comparable period sales growth in local currencies was 1 during the fourth quarter of 2008 which included an increase of 1 in europe and 6 in asiarest of world offset in part by a 3 decline in the americas our future sales in local currencies will continue to be adversely affected by the weak global economic conditions it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results will be affected in this uncertain environment 

 

with respect to our enduser markets we experienced improved results during 2008 in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities however demand from these markets 

decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the previously mentioned global economic slowdown we expect reduced demand in these markets will continue during 2009 

 

in our industrial markets the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in emerging markets related to increasing production capacity for domestic and export markets although this provides a significant opportunity for our emerging market operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial enduser markets in the us and europe however despite this challenge our us and european industrial enduser markets experienced solid sales growth during 2008 our industrial markets and our coreindustrial products also experienced reduced demand during the fourth quarter of 2008 including our emerging markets we expect reduced demand in these markets will continue during 2009 

 

in our food retail end markets we benefited from strong project activity in europe while our us business faced difficult comparisons to the prior year traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation similar to our industrial business emerging markets also provide growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year while sales in our food retail end markets experienced solid project activity during the fourth quarter of 2008 we could experience a sales reduction during 2009 related to the global economic slowdown 

 

in 2009 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve abovemarket sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broadbased efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities the implementation of more effective pricing and valuebased selling strategies and processes improved sales force training and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 27 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have over a 20year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 18 in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are pleased with our continued accomplishments in china and continue to expand our territory coverage with new branch offices additional dealers and more service professionals in recent years india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth due to increased life science research activities as well as our acquisition of our distribution channel for laboratory products in 2005 in addition russia has also been an important growth driver in recent years due in part to the expansion of its local economy local currency sales growth in emerging markets slowed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and we anticipate future sales will continue to be adversely affected by weak global economic conditions to reduce costs we are also shifting more of our manufacturing to china where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent between 51 and 52 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base during 2008 we also introduced quantos our new automated powder dosing solution for small sample sizes which is controlled and monitored by the laboratory balance 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure as previously mentioned shifting production to china has been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2008 we also initiated a global cost reduction program in response to the global economic slowdown our cost reduction program is focused on reducing our spending levels in most cost categories and will also include workforce reductions including employees and temporary personnel of approximately 600 or 5 of our total workforce 

 

pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

net sales 

 

net sales were 19733 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 17937 million in 2007 and 15949 million in 2006 this represents increases in 2008 and 2007 of 10 and 12 in us dollars and 6 and 8 in local currencies respectively 

 

in 2008 our net sales by geographic destination increased in local currencies by 2 in the americas 6 in europe and 16 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

 

as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification preventative maintenance and spare parts 

 

net sales of products increased in 2008 and 2007 by 10 and 13 in us dollars and by 7 and 8 in local currencies respectively service revenue including spare parts increased in 2008 and 2007 by 8 and 11 in us dollars and by 5 and 6 in local currencies respectively 

 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products increased by 6 in local currencies during 2008 principally driven by strong growth across most product categories especially analytical instruments pipettes and process analytics our laboratoryrelated product sales were also reduced by 1 during 2008 due to product line exits 

 

net sales of our industrialrelated products increased by 7 in local currencies during 2008 we experienced strong sales growth in our core industrial products throughout most geographies particularly china as well as solid sales growth in our product inspection products we also experienced strong sales growth in transportation and logistics products in the united states and western europe related to increased project activity 

 

in our food retailing markets net sales increased by 4 in local currencies during 2008 over the previous year due to strong project activity in europe and continued growth in asiarest of world despite decreased sales in the us 

 

as discussed above net sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased from the results of the first nine months in 2008 we expect market conditions to further deteriorate from the levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008 however the level of this deterioration is unknown 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 503 for 2008 compared to 500 for 2007 and 496 for 2006 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 542 for 2008 compared to 538 for 2007 and 533 for 2006 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 368 for 2008 compared to 369 for both 2007 and 2006 

 

the increase in gross profit reflects several factors including increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs partially offset by the weakening us dollar and increased material costs most notably steel prices 

 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 52 for 2008 51 for 2007 and 52 for 2006 research and development expenses increased by 4 in 2008 and increased by 7 in 2007 in local currencies our research and development spending levels reflect increased research and development investments 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 294 for 2008 compared to 295 for 2007 and 302 for 2006 selling general and administrative expenses increased by 5 in both 2008 and 2007 in local currencies this is primarily due to continued sales and marketing investments especially in china and other emerging market countries and expenses associated with product launches we also incurred certain expenses associated with a multiyear information technology investment 

 

other charges income net 

 

other charges income net consisted of other charges net of 90 million in 2008 compared to other income net of 09 million in 2007 and other income net of 79 million in 2006 other charges income net consisted primarily of restructuring charges interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items other charges income net in 2008 includes restructuring charges of 64 million related to our global cost reduction program as further described below other charges income net for 2008 compared to the prior year was also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and reduced interest income associated with lower cash balances in 2007 other charges income net reflected reduced interest income compared to the prior year associated with lower cash balances resulting from share repurchases in 2006 other charges income net included increased interest income associated with higher cash balances in the us as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005 associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a global cost reduction program charges under the program will primarily comprise severance costs and are expected to be approximately 15 to 20 million of which 64 million was recorded in other charges income net during the year ended december 31 2008 cash paid for severance during the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled 07 million under the program our workforce including employees and temporary personnel will be reduced by approximately 600 the program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2009 as a result of the reduction in workforce we anticipate personnel costs to be reduced by approximately 25 million on an annual basis 

 

interest expense and taxes 

 

interest expense was 254 million for 2008 compared to 210 million for 2007 and 175 million for 2006 the increase in 2008 is due primarily to increased borrowings compared to 2007 the increase in 2007 is due to higher average borrowing rates offset in part by reduced average borrowings versus 2006 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 25 million related to favorable withholding tax law changes in china during the third quarter of 2008 we recorded discrete tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of 35 million primarily related to the closure of certain tax matters 

during the third quarter of 2007 we recorded certain discrete tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of 11 million the discrete items include a benefit of 34 million related to a favorable resolution of certain tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years which were partially offset by a charge of 23 million primarily due to a tax law change in germany 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we implemented a legal reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30 to 27 in addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate we recorded three discrete tax items a charge of 105 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards a benefit of 134 million associated with a reduction of a liability previously established for estimated costs to repatriate unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a favorable tax law change resulting in a benefit of 51 million 

 

our annual effective tax rate was 24 27 and 23 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 2 in 2008 and 4 in 2006 

 

results of operations — by operating segment 

 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

us operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in total net sales during 2008 reflects growth across most product lines particularly our laboratoryrelated and industrialrelated products our laboratoryrelated and industrialrelated products experienced especially strong growth in analytical instruments and product inspection respectively net sales were reduced by 1 related to product line exits net sales to external customers declined 4 during the fourth quarter of 2008 which included a decrease in most product categories related to the global economic slowdown we expect net sales will also decline during 2009 

 

segment profit increased by 85 million in our us operations segment during 2008 compared to an increase of 155 million during 2007 the increase in segment profit in 2008 was primarily due to increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs and increased intersegment income from our chinese operations offset in part by investments in sales and marketing

total net sales in local currency increased by 2 in 2008 and by 11 in 2007 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 4 in 2008 and by 9 in 2007 the increase in sales to external customers during 2008 relates primarily to strong growth in most of our laboratoryrelated products particularly in process analytics as well as improved project activity in retail products net sales to external customers in local currency declined 6 during the fourth quarter of 2008 which included a decrease in most product categories especially laboratory and industrialrelated products related to the global economic slowdown we expect net sales in local currency will also decline during 2009 

 

segment profit increased by 55 million in our swiss operations segment during 2008 compared to an increase of 111 million during 2007 the increase in segment profit in 2008 is primarily due to increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs partially offset by higher research and development project activity and unfavorable currency 

 

western european operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 6 in 2008 and 2007 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 5 in 2008 and 2007 the 2008 increase includes solid sales growth in our industrialrelated and laboratoryrelated products we also experienced strong european retail project activity during 2008 net sales to external customers increased 2 in local currency during the fourth quarter of 2008 which included strong project activity in our food retail products and transportation and logistics as well as solid growth in our product inspection sales these results were offset in part by reduced sales in our laboratory and coreindustrial products related to the global economic slowdown we expect net sales in local currency for our laboratory and coreindustrial products will also decline during 2009 sales in our food retail products transportation and logistics and product inspection may also be reduced during 2009 

 

segment profit increased by 113 million in our western european operations segment during 2008 compared to an increase of 79 million in 2007 the increase in segment profit in 2008 is principally a result of increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs and favorable currency translation fluctuations partially offset by increased sales and marketing investments we also recorded severance expense of 51 million during the first nine months of 2008 

 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 14 in 2008 and by 21 in 2007 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 24 in 2008 and 21 in 2007 these increases were due to continued sales growth for most product lines in particular industrialrelated products net sales to external customers in local currency increased 9 during the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a reduction in our 

historical growth rate related to the global economic slowdown we expect our net sales in local currency will be adversely affected during 2009 by weak global economic conditions 

 

segment profit increased by 15 million in our chinese operations segment during 2008 compared to an increase of 123 million in 2007 the increase in segment profit in 2008 is primarily due to increased sales volume partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations on intersegment sales increased material costs increased intersegment expenses from our us operations and a previous year gain associated with an asset sale 

 

other amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 9 in 2008 and by 15 in 2007 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 9 in 2008 and 13 in 2007 this performance reflects increased sales in our other asia pacific eastern european and other americas markets net sales to external customers in local currency increased 2 during the fourth quarter of 2008 and included sales growth in other asia pacific offset in part by reduced sales in canada eastern europe and japan we expect our net sales in local currency will be adversely affected during 2009 by weak global economic conditions 

 

segment profit decreased by 11 million in our other segment during 2008 compared to an increase of 85 million during 2007 the decrease in segment profit was primarily a result of decreased profitability in canada and severance expense partially offset by increased profitability in other asia pacific and other eastern european markets 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions 

 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 2238 million in 2008 compared to 2282 million in 2007 and 1916 million in 2006 the decrease in 2008 resulted principally from reduced accounts payable balances of 159 million from the beginning of the year versus increased balances of 264 million during the previous year which was largely attributable to strong december 2007 business activity the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to higher payments of approximately 109 million related to 2007 performancerelated compensation incentives bonus payments that were paid during 2008 and the timing of tax disbursements of 219 million these items were offset in part by higher net earnings of 243 million compared to the corresponding period in 2007 the increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted principally from improved operating results and a reduction in tax payments which included a 6 million tax refund offset in part by approximately 9 million of higher payments related to 2006 performancerelated compensation incentives bonus payments that were paid during 2007 we also made a 50 million voluntary incremental pension contribution to our us plan in 2008 and a 77 million contribution to our us plan in 2007 

 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 610 million in 2008 475 million in 2007 and 343 million in 2006 we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change our 2008 capital 

expenditures included 200 million of investments related to the initial phases of our blue ocean multiyear program of information technology investment compared to 50 million in the previous year our capital expenditures in 2007 included 71 million of investments related to our new chinese facility compared to 64 million in 2006 

 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2008 included 33 million of financing fees related to the closing of our new 950 million credit facility during the third quarter as further described below in accordance with our share repurchase plan we purchased 2232188 shares and 3384731 shares in the amount of 2245 million and 3246 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

 

in addition our ability to generate cash flow may be reduced due to the global economic slowdown in light of the economic downturn and instability in the financial markets we have taken a more conservative posture towards the utilization of our cash flow and capital structure this includes suspending our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2008 we presently cannot estimate what purchases may be made in 2009 if any 

 

credit agreement 

 

on august 15 2008 the company entered into a 950 million new credit agreement the “credit agreement” which replaced its 450 million amended and restated credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” the new credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions similar to our prior credit agreement and has a maturity date of august 15 2013 it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on the company’s senior unsecured credit ratings which was as of december 31 2008 set at libor plus 070 based on ratings of “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa2” by moody’s the company must also pay facility fees that are tied to its credit ratings the credit agreement contains covenants with which the company was in compliance as of december 31 2008 including maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 325 to 10 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on the company including limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control the company capitalized 33 million in financing fees associated with the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2013 as of december 31 2008 approximately 6664 million was available under the facility 

 

senior notes 

 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

 

at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

 

  

the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2008 

 

 

 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

 

at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our credit agreement and senior notes in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

 

we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition to the above table we also have liabilities for income taxes pension and postretirement funding however we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond 2008 for income taxes and beyond 2009 for pension and postretirement funding 

 

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 

share repurchase program 

 

we have a share repurchase program that was announced in 2004 under the program we have been authorized to buy back up to 15 billion of the company’s common shares as of december 31 2008 there 

were 4166 million of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the plan by december 31 2010 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors in addition our ability to generate cash flow may be reduced due to the global economic slowdown in light of the economic downturn and instability in the financial markets we have taken a more conservative posture towards the utilization of our cash flow and capital structure this includes suspending our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2008 we presently cannot estimate what purchases may be made in 2009 if any we have purchased 152 million shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2008 

 

during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we spent 2245 million and 3246 million on the repurchase of 2232188 shares and 3384731 shares at an average price per share of 10055 and 9588 respectively in addition 52 million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december 31 2007 were cash settled during 2008 we reissued 139780 shares and 567205 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

we also reissued 16760 shares held in treasury pursuant to our 2007 share plan which extends certain eligible employees the option to receive a percentage of their annual bonus in shares of the company’s stock 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor in recent months we have seen substantially higher volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past and the swiss franc has strengthened significantly against the euro we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 10 million to 14 million on an annual basis in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world including asia pacific eastern europe latin america and canada fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2008 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 50 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

taxes 

 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular 

jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our former subsidiary hispeed was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that njdep signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 06 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows 

 

inflation 

 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both 

favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the net fair value of these contracts was inconsequential at december 31 2008 and a 06 million gain at december 31 2007 a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would increase by 11 million at december 31 2008 as compared with a decrease of 16 million at december 31 2007 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of 28 million and a net gain of 06 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2008 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 20 million as compared with a decrease of 08 million at december 31 2007 conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 20 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2008 as compared with a net increase of 09 million at december 31 2007 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the net periodic pension credit cost for 2008 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2008 was 09 million and 1114 million respectively for our us pension plans and 96 million and 5604 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2008 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2008 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan was 08 million and 189 million respectively 

 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2008 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 850 for the us plan and 515 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 47 million after tax during 2008 our actual return on pension plan assets was a loss of 1187 million or approximately 16 of pension plan assets due to the recent decline in global stock markets these losses contributed to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity of 485 million during 2008 

 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2008 the average discount rate assumption was 625 for the us plans and 395 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 16 million after tax 

 

in 2008 and 2007 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 50 million and 77 million to reduce the underfunded status and increase the funded status of our us pension plan respectively in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

 

equity compensation 

 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which as of january 1 2006 are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award under sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” prior to january 1 2006 these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations these methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 

trade accounts receivable 

 

as of december 31 2008 trade accounts receivable were 3486 million net of a 120 million allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 

 

inventory 

 

as of december 31 2008 inventories were 1706 million 

 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2008 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4244 million and other intangible assets of 963 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows including from a prolonged economic slowdown we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

 

we plan to repatriate earnings from china switzerland the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently invested and we currently believe that there will be no additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other than withholding taxes 

 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 2661 million for the year ended december 31 2008 each increase of 26 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s products typically require no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a postshipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is deemed perfunctory we generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain appropriate accruals for outstanding credits further certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer revenue is recognized on these products upon title transfer and risk of loss to its distributors distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented 

 

service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed spare parts sold on a standalone basis are recognized upon title transfer which is generally at the time of shipment revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance on a customer’s predefined equipment over the contract period service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 

 

warranty 

 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products target markets in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service such as the educational market we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2 of 2007 net sales 

 

sales and service 

 

market organizations 

 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers each market organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 

 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2007 our sales and services group consisted of over 5400 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 

service 

 

our service business remains successful with a focus on repair and maintenance as well as further expansion of our offerings to include valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

 

research and development and manufacturing 

 

producing organizations 

 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 

research and development 

 

we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2571 million in research and development 924 million in 2007 828 million in 2006 and 819 million in 2005 in 2007 we spent approximately 51 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 

  

we continue to devote an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 900 employees in research and development and product engineering 

 

manufacturing 

 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

 

backlog seasonality 

 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 27 to 30 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 9500 employees throughout the world including approximately 4200 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 2300 in asia and other countries 

 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years except for a strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which has been closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

 

intellectual property 

 

we hold over 2000 patents and trademarks primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan china and india our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

 

regulation 

 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp and pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities our former subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 05 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

competition 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets for example some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own in addition some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater 

demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors affecting our future operating results 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 1683 million of sales to external customers and 575 million of segment profit in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 

  

we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

 

economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices moreover economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

 

the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries economic downturns or recessions in these countries would likely adversely affect our operating results 

 

although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in difficult economic times economic downturns or recessions in developed countries would likely adversely affect our operating results customers may also purchase lowercost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

 

our markets are highly competitive many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who although relatively small in size today could become larger companies in their home markets given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

 

an interruption in our business due to events such as natural disasters pandemics or other health crises fires explosions or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our 

debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 

 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

 

we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees our executive officers own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed important rd personnel may leave and join competitors which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 

 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to product safety labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2007 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4408 million and other intangible assets of 1000 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we might incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lowerthanexpected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 

currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our total net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important 

crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately 11 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2007 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 124 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2007 we had total indebtedness of approximately 3154 million net of cash of 812 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

 

our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios 

 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and are subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under our credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

 

our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control 

 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

 

net sales in us dollars increased by 12 and 8 in 2007 and 2006 respectively excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 8 and 7 in 2007 and 2006 respectively we enjoyed a strong world economy in 2007 with favorable market conditions in europe continued solid growth in the united states and generally strong demand in most asian countries 

 

in respect to our enduser markets we experienced improved results during 2007 in our laboratoryrelated enduser markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities we believe that the longterm fundamentals of the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 

 

in our industrial markets the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to increasing production capacity for the domestic and export markets although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe however despite this challenge our us and european industrial enduser markets experienced solid sales growth during 2007 

 

in our food retail end markets we faced difficult comparisons in both europe and the us related to previous year project activity traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors increased spending in the past has come from events such as y2k and the introduction of the euro currency similar to our industrial business china also provides growth as the expansion of its local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 

in 2008 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve above market sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broad based efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation activities the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes and other sales and marketing topics our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in addition to traditional repair and maintenance our service offerings continue to expand into valueadded services for a range of market needs including regulatory compliance 

 

expanding emerging markets emerging markets comprising asia excluding japan eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa account for approximately 25 of our total net sales we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have a 20 year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 15 in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are also experiencing rapid growth in india from increased life science research activities as well as our acquisition of our distribution channel for laboratory products in 2005 in addition russia continues to be an important growth driver due in part to the expansion of its local economy to reduce costs we are also shifting more of our manufacturing to china where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent between 51 and 55 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure as previously mentioned shifting production to china has been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

 

pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

net sales 

 

net sales were 17937 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 15949 million in 2006 and 14825 million in 2005 this represents increases in 2007 and 2006 of 12 and 8 in us dollars and 8 and 7 in local currencies respectively 

 

in 2007 our net sales by geographic destination increased in local currencies by 6 in the americas 6 in europe and 16 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

 

as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory 

compliance qualification calibration certification and repair services much of which is provided under contracts as well as sales of spare parts 

 

net sales of products increased in 2007 and 2006 by 13 and 8 in us dollars and by 8 and 7 in local currencies respectively service revenue including spare parts increased in 2007 and 2006 by 11 and 8 in us dollars and by 6 and 7 in local currencies respectively 

 

net sales of our laboratoryrelated products increased by 7 in local currencies during 2007 principally driven by strong growth across most product categories especially analytical instruments and process analytics our laboratoryrelated product sales were also reduced by 1 during 2007 due to product line exits 

 

net sales of our industrialrelated products increased by 10 in local currencies during 2007 we experienced strong sales growth in our product inspection products especially xray products we also benefited from solid sales growth in our core industrial products throughout most geographies particularly china 

 

in our food retailing markets net sales increased by 3 in local currencies during 2007 over the previous year due to increased sales in asia and the americas european sales were flat versus the previous year due to difficult comparisons associated with strong project activity during 2006 the food retailing markets also continue to experience improved growth of software solutions 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 500 for 2007 compared to 496 for 2006 and 493 for 2005 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 538 for 2007 compared to 533 for 2006 and 532 for 2005 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 369 for 2007 compared to 369 for 2006 and 360 for 2005 

 

the increase in gross profit reflects several factors including increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs partially offset by increased product costs most notably steel prices 

 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 51 for 2007 52 for 2006 and 55 in 2005 research and development expenses increased by 7 in 2007 and increased by 1 in 2006 in local currencies our research and development spending levels reflect increased research and development investments 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 295 for 2007 compared to 302 for 2006 and 298 for 2005 selling general and administrative expenses increased by 5 in 2007 and 9 in 2006 in local currencies this is primarily due to continued sales and marketing investments especially in china and other emerging market countries as well as higher performancerelated compensation costs these increases are partly offset by savings from our cost reduction initiatives implemented during the second half of 2006 

 

other income charges net 

 

other income charges net consisted of other income net of 09 million in 2007 and 79 million in 2006 compared to other charges net of 202 million in 2005 other income charges net consisted primarily of interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items the decrease in other charges income net for 2007 compared to the prior year is due to lower interest income associated with the decrease in cash balances resulting from share repurchases in 2006 other income charges net included increased interest income associated with higher cash balances in the us as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005 associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 during 2005 other income charges net included a 218 million charge related to litigation we wrote off a 199 million intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor in 

june 2005 this license granted one of our wholly owned subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain thirdparty manufactured pipettes in the united states a judgment entered on june 6 2005 terminated the license agreement and awarded damages to the other party we also incurred 19 million of related legal costs during 2005 which included damages of 06 million the damages of 06 million were subsequently reversed during 2006 

 

interest expense and taxes 

 

interest expense was 210 million for 2007 compared to 175 million for 2006 and 149 million for 2005 the increase in 2007 is due to higher average borrowing rates offset in part by reduced average borrowings versus 2006 the increase in 2006 and 2005 was principally due to higher average borrowings over the prior year due to our increased debt balance in europe as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005 associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

during the third quarter of 2007 we recorded certain discrete tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of 11 million the discrete items include a benefit of 34 million related to a favorable resolution of certain tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years which were partially offset by a charge of 23 million primarily due to a tax law change in germany 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we implemented a legal reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30 to 27 in addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate we recorded three discrete tax items a charge of 105 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards a benefit of 134 million associated with a reduction of a liability previously established for estimated costs to repatriate unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a favorable tax law change resulting in a benefit of 51 million 

 

pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 we repatriated 396 million of cash during 2005 that was generated over time by our foreign operations as a result of this repatriation we recorded additional income tax expense of 131 million this amount reflected the federal tax impact in the united states including certain state taxes of 123 million foreign withholding taxes of 20 million and a net decrease of 12 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of preexisting and future dividend repatriations in addition we recorded tax benefits of 77 million related to a favorable resolution of certain tax matters our tax rate for 2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the previously described litigation 

 

our annual effective tax rate was 27 23 and 32 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by 4 in 2006 and raising it by 2 in 2005 

 

results of operations — by operating segment 

 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

us operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 23 

 

the increase in total net sales during 2007 reflects growth across most product lines particularly our laboratoryrelated and industrialrelated products our laboratoryrelated and industrialrelated products experienced especially strong growth in analytical instruments and product inspection respectively net sales were reduced by 1 related to product line exits 

 

segment profit increased by 155 million in our us operations segment during 2007 compared to an increase of 99 million during 2006 the increase in segment profit in 2007 was primarily due to increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs and benefits of our cost reduction initiatives segment profit also benefited from the resolution of two legal matters which were partially offset by a 11 million loss on the sale of a product line 

 

swiss operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 11 in 2007 and 6 in 2006 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 9 in 2007 and increased by 10 in 2006 the increase in sales to external customers during 2007 relates to continued growth in our laboratoryrelated products we also continue to experience strong export sales growth to emerging markets 

 

segment profit increased by 111 million in our swiss operations segment during 2007 compared to an increase of 46 million during 2006 the increase in segment profit in 2007 is primarily due to increased sales volume favorable product mix and favorable currency translation fluctuations partially offset by increased research and development and sales and marketing investments 

 

western european operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 6 in 2007 and 5 in 2006 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 5 in 2007 and 5 in 2006 the 2007 increase is primarily due to strong sales growth in our product inspection laboratoryrelated and core industrial products due to benefits from our sales and marketing initiatives as well as improved market conditions offset in part by a decline in food retailing products related to strong customer project activity in the prior year 

 

segment profit increased by 79 million in our western european operations segment during 2007 compared to an increase of 52 million in 2006 the increase in segment profit in 2007 is principally a result of increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs favorable product mix favorable currency translation fluctuations and benefits of our cost reduction initiatives partially offset by charges associated with cost reduction initiatives 

chinese operations amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 21 in 2007 and 12 in 2006 net sales to external customers in local currency increased by 21 in 2007 and 10 in 2006 these increases were due to continued sales growth for all product lines in particular industrialrelated products 

 

segment profit increased by 123 million in our chinese operations segment during 2007 compared to an increase of 49 million in 2006 the increase in segment profit in 2007 is primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing and research and development our chinese operations also benefited from a gain associated with an asset sale 

 

other amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased by 15 in 2007 and 14 in 2006 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 13 in 2007 and 14 in 2006 this performance reflects increased sales growth across most product lines in our other asian pacific eastern european and other north american markets 

 

segment profit increased by 85 million in our other segment during 2007 compared to an increase of 67 million during 2006 segment profit increased during 2007 primarily due to strong sales volume and benefits from our cost reduction programs partially offset by costs associated with a contractual termination 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions in 2005 we increased our debt balance in europe and our cash balance in the united states as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 2282 million in 2007 compared to 1916 million in 2006 and 1771 million in 2005 the increase in 2007 resulted principally from improved operating results and a reduction in tax payments which included a 6 million tax refund offset in part by approximately 9 million of higher payments related to 2007 performancerelated compensation incentives bonus payments compared to the corresponding period in 2006 we also made a 8 million voluntary incremental pension contribution to our us plan in 2007 compared to a 6 million contribution to our uk plan in 2006 the increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulted principally from improved operating results and reduced inventory levels which was offset in part by a 6 million voluntary incremental pension contribution to our uk pension plan similarly to previous years we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of approximately 178 million in 2008 

capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 475 million in 2007 343 million in 2006 and 325 million in 2005 we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change our capital expenditures in 2007 included 71 million of investments related to our new chinese facility compared to 64 million in 2006 in 2007 capital expenditures also included 5 million of software licenses relating to investments in corporate information technology systems 

 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

 

credit agreement 

 

in november 2005 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement “the credit agreement” the 450 million credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of november 5 2010 it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa3” by moody’s and is currently set at libor plus 0375 we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the credit agreement contains covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of less than 325 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level in addition the credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control as of december 31 2007 approximately 2168 million was available under the facility the credit agreement is unsecured we incurred fees of approximately 09 million in conjunction with amending and restating the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2010 

 

senior notes 

 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

 

at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

 

  

the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2007 amounts in thousands 

 

 

 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

 

at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our amended credit agreement and senior notes in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

 

we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our amended credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition to the above table we also have liabilities for income taxes pension and postretirement funding however we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond 2007 for income taxes and beyond 2008 for pension and postretirement funding 

 

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

share repurchase program 

 

we have a share repurchase program that was announced in 2004 under the program we have been authorized to buy back up to 15 billion of the company’s common shares as of december 31 2007 there were 6411 million of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the plan by december 31 2010 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors we have purchased 130 million shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2007 

 

during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we spent 3246 million and 2659 million on the repurchase of 3384731 shares and 4141559 shares at an average price per share of 9588 and 6418 respectively an additional 52 million and 54 million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december 31 2007 and 2006 were cash settled during 2008 and 2007 respectively we reissued 567205 shares and 1152892 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

 

effect of currency on results of operations 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies the chinese yuan and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 11 million to 13 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2007 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 124 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

taxes 

 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our former subsidiary hispeed was one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that njdep signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 05 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows 

 

inflation 

 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the fair value of these contracts was a 06 million gain and a 02 million gain at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 16 million at december 31 2007 as compared with a decrease of 35 million at december 31 2006 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities 

denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a 06 million gain at december 31 2007 and a 04 million loss at december 31 2006 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2007 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 08 million as compared with a decrease of 10 million at december 31 2006 conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 09 million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2007 as compared with a net increase of 11 million at december 31 2006 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the net periodic pension cost for 2007 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2007 were 08 million and 1072 million respectively for our us pension plans and 82 million and 6053 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2007 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2007 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 08 million and 220 million respectively 

 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2007 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 85 for the us plan and 52 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 53 million after tax 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2007 the average discount rate assumption was 625 for the us plans and 390 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 27 million after tax 

 

in 2007 and 2006 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 77 million and 60 million respectively to reduce the underfunded status of our us and uk pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

 

equity compensation 

 

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which as of january 1 2006 are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grantdate fair value of the award under sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” prior to january 1 2006 these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental information including pro forma earnings and earnings per share as if we had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” these methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

 

inventory 

 

as of december 31 2007 inventories were 1737 million 

 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2007 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4408 million and other intangible assets of 1000 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable cost growth perpetual 

growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

as of december 31 2004 our intangible assets included a 199 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license this license was previously subject to litigation with the grantor and on june 6 2005 we were ordered to pay 06 million in damages and the respective intellectual property license was terminated due to the cancellation of the license we concluded that the intangible asset had no future benefit and as such during the second quarter of 2005 we wrote off the total value of the asset 199 million 12 million after tax this charge has been included as a component of other income charges net within the statement of operations the damages of 06 million were subsequently reversed during 2006 

 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

 

we have undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries and currently believe that there will be no cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings 

 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 2429 million for the year ended december 31 2007 each increase of 24 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our typical solution requires no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a post shipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is perfunctory we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits distributor discounts are offset against 

revenue at the time such revenue is recognized revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented 

 

warranty 

 

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels including sales of our “ohaus” branded products ohaus branded products principally target the educational market and other markets in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2 of 2006 net sales 

 

sales and service 

 

market organizations 

 

we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers each market organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 

 

we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2006 our sales and services group consisted of over 3600 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business with a consistent global approach 

 

service 

 

we have expanded our service business from one focused on repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other valueadded services we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in 2006 service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 

 

beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

 

research and development and manufacturing 

 

producing organizations 

 

our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

 

research and development 

 

we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2479 million in research and development 828 million in 2006 819 million in 2005 and 832 million in 2004 in 2006 we spent approximately 52 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

 

  

we continue to devote an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 800 employees in research and development and product engineering 

 

manufacturing 

 

we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally located in china germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 

 

we generally manufacture only critical components which are components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements are 

adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 

 

backlog seasonality 

 

our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

 

our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 2729 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 9100 employees throughout the world including approximately 4100 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 2000 in asia and other countries 

 

we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years except for a strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which has been closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

 

intellectual property 

 

we hold over 1700 patents and trademarks primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and china our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

 

regulation 

 

our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

 

approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

 

our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities our subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 07 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

competition 

 

our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

 

we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors affecting our future operating results 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 

 

we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant potion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 1327 million of sales to external customers and 452 million of segment profit in addition to the currency risks discussed below international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

 

  

we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

 

economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices moreover economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 

 

our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of whom are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with 

competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

 

our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 

 

we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

 

our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 

 

an interruption in our business due to acts such as natural disasters fires explosions or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers it may be expensive to resolve these issues even though we hold certain insurance more importantly customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 

 

a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical food food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

 

we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 

 

we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations technologies and products diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of these acquisitionrelated risks could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 

 

larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

 

if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others our operating results could be harmed 

 

our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

 

departures of key employees could impair our operations 

 

we have employment contracts with each of our key employees in addition our key employees own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

 

we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in various facilities in addition some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies 

 

our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 

we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2006 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4329 million and other intangible assets of 1028 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 

 

in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

 

currency fluctuations may affect our operating profits 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately 10 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2006 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 229 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 

 

we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2006 we had total indebtedness of approximately 2044 million net of cash of 1513 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

 

our debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures product development and other corporate requirements increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in raw material costs 

limit our ability to respond to business opportunities limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements incur liens and consolidate merge sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios 

 

our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and are subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes andor under our credit facility an event of default under our credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

 

our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control 

 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

 

we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

overview 

 

we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

 

net sales in us dollars increased by 8 and 6 in 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 7 and 5 in 2006 and 2005 respectively we enjoyed an improved world economy in 2006 compared to recent years with improved market conditions in europe continued solid growth in the united states and generally strong demand in most asian countries 

 

in respect to our end user markets we experienced improved results during 2006 in our laboratoryrelated end user markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities we believe that the longterm fundamentals of the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 

 

in our industrial markets the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to production capacity although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe however despite this challenge our us and european industrial end user markets experienced solid sales growth during 2006 

 

in our food retail end markets we experienced strong results in both europe and the us related to increased project activity traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors increased spending in the past has come from events such as y2k and the introduction of the euro currency while we have not experienced similar triggering events in recent years we have enjoyed strong overall demand in 2006 similar to our industrial business china also provides growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 

 

in 2007 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

 

gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to achieve above market sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broad based efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation activities the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes and further automation of field processes our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets in addition to traditional services we offer installation calibration regulatory compliance services and remote service support 

 

expanding emerging markets we have a twopronged strategy in emerging markets first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have nearly a 20 year track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 10 per year in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are shifting more of our manufacturing to china to reduce costs where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export we are also experiencing rapid growth in india from increased life science research activities as well as our acquisition of our distribution channel for laboratory products in 2005 in addition russia continues to be an important growth driver due in part to the expansion of their local economy 

 

extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent between 52 and 59 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software in addition we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 

 

maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure as previously mentioned shifting production to china has been an important component of our cost savings initiatives we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 

 

pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

net sales 

 

net sales were 15949 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 14825 million in 2005 and 14045 million in 2004 this represents increases in 2006 and 2005 of 8 and 6 in us dollars and 7 and 5 in local currencies respectively 

 

in 2006 our net sales by geographic destination increased in local currencies by 5 in the americas 7 in europe and 10 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

 

as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and repair services much of which is provided under contracts as well as sales of spare parts 

 

net sales of products increased in 2006 and 2005 by 8 and 6 in us dollars and by 7 and 6 in local currencies respectively service revenue including spare parts increased in 2006 and 2005 by 8 and 5 in us dollars and by 7 and 5 in local currencies respectively 

 

net sales for our laboratoryrelated products increased 6 in local currencies during 2006 with strong growth in process analytics laboratory balances and analytical instruments 

 

net sales of our industrialrelated products increased 6 in 2006 in local currencies we experienced sales growth in our core industrial products most notably our heavy industrial and standard industrial weighing products as well as our product inspection products especially xray products 

 

in our food retailing markets net sales increased 11 in 2006 in local currencies over the previous year due to increased sales across all geographic regions particularly in europe and the us related to strong project activity the food retailing markets also continue to experience improved growth of software solutions 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 496 for 2006 compared to 493 for 2005 and 486 for 2004 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 533 for 2006 compared to 532 for 2005 and 523 for 2004 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 369 for 2006 compared to 360 for 2005 and 361 for 2004 

 

the increase in gross profit percentage reflects benefits from our sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs our cost rationalization initiatives and the impact of increased pricing these trends were offset in part by unfavorable product mix and lower margin project activity 

 

research and development and selling general and administrative expenses 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 52 for 2006 compared to 55 for 2005 and 59 in 2004 research and development expenses increased by 1 in 2006 and decreased by 2 in 2005 in local currencies our research and development spending levels reflect improved productivity the timing of projects and our desire to reallocate research and development resources to marketing 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 302 for 2006 compared to 298 for 2005 and 299 for 2004 selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 in 2006 and 5 in 2005 in local currencies this increase is due in part to sharebased compensation expense in 2006 of 82 million sales and marketing investments particularly in china higher performance related compensation as well as charges associated with our cost reduction programs in 2006 during 2004 we incurred 50 million related to an investigation into allegations made by an employee with respect to the company and various company processes 

 

other income charges net 

 

other income charges net consisted of other income net of 79 million in 2006 compared to other charges net of 202 million in 2005 and 01 million in 2004 other income charges net consisted primarily of interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions gains losses from sales of assets and other items in 2006 other income charges net includes increased interest income associated with higher cash balances in the us as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005 associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 during 2005 other income charges net also included a 218 million charge related to litigation we wrote off a 199 million intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor in june 2005 this license enabled one of our wholly owned subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain thirdparty manufactured pipettes in the united states a judgment entered on june 6 2005 terminated the license agreement and awarded damages to the other party we also incurred 19 million of related legal costs during 2005 which included damages of 06 million the damages of 06 million were subsequently reversed during 2006 

interest expense and taxes 

 

interest expense was 175 million for 2006 compared to 149 million for 2005 and 129 million for 2004 the increase in 2006 and 2005 was principally due to higher average borrowings over the prior year due to our increased debt balance in europe as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005 associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we implemented a legal reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30 to 27 in addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate we recorded three discrete tax items a charge of 105 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards a benefit of 134 million associated with a reduction of a liability previously established for estimated costs to repatriate unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a favorable tax law change resulting in a benefit of 51 million 

 

pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 we repatriated 396 million of cash during 2005 that was generated over time by our foreign operations as a result of this repatriation we recorded additional income tax expense of 131 million this amount reflects the federal tax impact in the united states including certain state taxes of 123 million foreign withholding taxes of 20 million and a net decrease of 12 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of preexisting and future dividend repatriations in addition we recorded tax benefits of 77 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters our tax rate for 2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the previously described litigation 

 

excluding the tax effects of the previously described discrete tax items our annual effective tax rate would have been 27 30 and 30 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively including these items our annual effective tax rate was 23 32 and 30 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

earnings before taxes and net earnings 

 

earnings before taxes were 2048 million for 2006 compared to 1602 million in 2005 and 1542 million in 2004 net earnings were 1575 million for 2006 compared to 1089 million in 2005 and 1080 million in 2004 

 

the 2006 results included 82 million of sharebased compensation expense 55 million after tax net earnings in 2006 also included the previously described discrete tax items amounting to a 80 million net benefit the 2005 results included a onetime 218 million 131 million after tax charge related to the litigation described above net earnings in 2005 also included a 54 million net after tax expense related to the previously described discrete tax items the 2004 results included 50 million 35 million after tax related to the previously mentioned investigation the increase in net earnings excluding these items primarily reflected improved sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives and a reduced tax rate in 2006 

 

net earnings per diluted share were 386 for 2006 compared to 252 in 2005 and 237 in 2004 net earnings per diluted share for 2006 includes 014 of sharebased compensation expense and a benefit of 020 related to the previously described discrete tax items associated with a legal reorganization and the favorable tax law change net earnings per diluted share for 2005 includes a net charge of 012 related to the previously described tax items associated with the earnings repatriation associated with the american jobs creation act offset in part by the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and 030 related to the onetime litigation charge net earnings per diluted share for 2004 includes 008 of expense related to the previously described investigation net earnings per diluted share as reported increased 53 during 2006 compared to 6 in 2005 and 12 in 2004 excluding the effect of sharebased compensation the onetime litigation charge discrete tax items and investigation charge net earnings per diluted share would have increased 29 in 2006 20 in 2005 and 12 in 2004 in addition to our improved net earnings the increase in net earnings per diluted share also benefits from our share repurchase program 

results of operations — by operating segment 

 

the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

us operations 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in total net sales during 2006 is the result of improved sales to external customers and includes solid growth across most products particularly our food retailing products due to strong project activity as well as continued growth in our instore retail software solutions the increase in 2005 in total net sales reflected improved sales to external customers across most product lines including particularly strong results in our food retailing and transportation and logistics products due to significant project activity as well as solid growth in laboratory balances process analytics and analytical instruments 

 

segment profit increased 99 million in our us operations segment during 2006 compared to an increase of 38 million during 2005 the increase in segment profit for 2006 was primarily due to increased sales volume and our ability to leverage our fixed production costs and benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives the increase in segment profit of our us operations segment during 2005 is due to an increase in sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable product mix 

 

swiss operations 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased 6 in 2006 and 4 in 2005 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 10 in 2006 and decreased by 4 in 2005 the exit of our third party electronic component product line reduced total net sales by approximately 1 in 2005 the increase in sales to external customers during 2006 related primarily to particularly solid growth in our laboratoryrelated and industrialrelated products offset in part by reduced project activity we also experienced strong export sales growth to emerging markets the decrease in sales in 2005 related primarily to the exit of our third party electronic component product line combined with reduced food retailing project activity and reduced direct export sales to emerging markets partially offset by a strong increase in our industrialrelated products 

 

segment profit increased 46 million in our swiss operations segment during 2006 compared to an increase of 59 million during 2005 the increase in segment profit in 2006 is primarily due to increased sales volume our ability to leverage our fixed production costs particularly for laboratory balances and favorable currency translation fluctuations the increase in segment profit is partially offset by changes in intercompany pricing to other segments and higher research and development expense the increase in segment profit in 2005 primarily related to increased sales to other segments of laboratoryrelated products as well as benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 

western european operations 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased 5 in 2006 and 6 in 2005 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 5 in 2006 and 3 in 2005 the 2006 increase is primarily due to improved market conditions across most countries we also experienced strong sales growth in our food retailing products primarily related to project activity as well as solid growth in our laboratoryrelated products particularly process analytics the 2005 increase was primarily due to improved market conditions in the major european economies especially germany we experienced sales growth in 2005 across most product lines particularly laboratoryrelated products 

 

segment profit increased 52 million in our western european operations segment during 2006 compared to an increase of 53 million in 2005 the increase in segment profit for 2006 is principally a result of increased net sales volume and our ability to leverage our fixed production costs these benefits were partly offset by costs associated with our ongoing cost rationalization activities the increase in segment profit in 2005 is primarily a result of increased net sales and benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 

 

chinese operations 

 

 

 

 

  

total net sales in local currency increased 12 in 2006 and 8 in 2005 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 10 in 2006 and 12 in 2005 these increases were due to continued sales growth for all product lines in particular industrialrelated products 

 

segment profit increased 49 million in our chinese operations segment during 2006 compared to an increase of 85 million in 2005 the increase in 2006 and 2005 segment profit is primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume and leveraging our fixed production costs the increase in 2006 is partially offset by further investments in sales and marketing

total net sales in local currency increased 14 in 2006 and 11 in 2005 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 14 in 2006 and 11 in 2005 this performance reflected increased sales in our other asian pacific eastern european and other north american markets 

segment profit increased 67 million in our other operations segment during 2006 compared to an increase of 19 million during 2005 segment profit increased during 2006 primarily due to strong sales volume improved cost levels and inventory charges that occurred during 2005 segment profit increased during 2005 primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions in 2005 we have also increased our debt balance in europe and our cash balance in the united states as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1916 million in 2006 compared to 1771 million in 2005 and 1660 million in 2004 the increase in 2006 resulted principally from improved operating results and reduced inventory levels which was offset in part by a 6 million voluntary incremental pension contribution to our uk pension plan the increase in 2005 resulted principally from improved operating results offset in part by approximately 15 million of higher payments relating to 2004 performance related compensation incentives bonus payments cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was impacted by voluntary incremental pension contributions of 100 million to our us pension plan similar to previous years we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of approximately 115 million in 2007 

 

capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 343 million in 2006 325 million in 2005 and 279 million in 2004 we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change in 2006 we launched a building project for a new plant in china which will cost in the range of 10 million to 15 million over a two year period 

 

we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness 

 

november 2005 refinancing 

 

on november 7 2005 we entered into a revised credit agreement the “amended credit agreement” which amended and restated the existing credit agreement dated as of november 12 2003 the amended credit agreement increased the amount that can be borrowed under the facility from 300 million to 450 million extended the maturity date to november 2010 and lowered the margin applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder the remaining terms of the amended credit agreement are substantially the same as under the existing credit agreement we incurred fees of approximately 09 million in conjunction with amending and restating the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2010 

 

amended credit agreement 

 

the 450 million amended credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of november 5 2010 it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa3” by moody’s and is currently set at libor plus 0375 we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the amended credit agreement contains covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of less than 325 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 this also places certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level in addition the amended credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control as of december 31 2006 approximately 2539 million was available under the facility the amended credit agreement is unsecured 

 

senior notes 

 

in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

 

at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

 

  

the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

 

our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2006 

 

 

 

changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

 

at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our amended credit agreement and senior notes in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

 

we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our amended credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

 

  

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition to the above table we also have liabilities for income taxes pension and postretirement funding however we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond 2006 for income taxes and beyond 2007 for pension and postretirement funding 

 

we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

 

  

we have a share repurchase program under the program we have been authorized to buy back up to 900 million of equity shares as of december 31 2006 there were 3657 million of remaining equity shares authorized to be repurchased under the plan by december 31 2008 the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances borrowings and cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors we have purchased 96 million shares since the inception of the program through december 31 2006 

 

during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we spent 2659 million and 1646 million on the repurchase of 4141559 shares and 3229200 shares at an average price of 6418 and 5094 respectively an additional 54 million and 42 million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december 31 2006 and 2005 were cash settled during 2007 and 2006 respectively we reissued 1152892 shares and 1261332 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

 

effect of currency on results of operations 

 

because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and 

administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate that we monitor we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 09 million to 11 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2006 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 229 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

 

  

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 

 

we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey 

 

gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 07 million in the coming years 

 

in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

inflation 

 

inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 

 

moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations the fair value of these contracts was a 02 million gain and a 02 million loss at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 35 million at december 31 2006 as compared with a decrease of 41 million at december 31 2005 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a 04 million loss at december 31 2006 and 2005 based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2006 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 10 million as compared with a decrease of 13 million at december 31 2005 conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 11 million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2006 as compared with a net increase of 14 million at december 31 2005 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the 

application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

  

the net periodic pension cost for 2006 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2006 were 14 million and 1132 million respectively for our us pension plans and 61 million and 5697 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2006 and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2006 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 06 million and 239 million respectively 

 

pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

 

the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2006 the weighted average return on assets assumption was 85 for the us plan and 51 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 45 million after tax 

 

the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2006 the average discount rate assumption was 575 for the us plans and 330 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 23 million after tax 

 

in 2006 and 2004 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 60 million and 100 million respectively to reduce the under funded status of our uk and us pension plans in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 

 

  

we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and other equitybased awards which as of january 1 2006 are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award under sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” prior to january 1 2006 these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental information including pro forma earnings and earnings per share as if we had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” these methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

  

as of december 31 2006 inventories were 1484 million 

 

we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on forecast usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

 

  

as of december 31 2006 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4329 million and other intangible assets of 1028 million 

 

our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

 

as of december 31 2004 our intangible assets included a 199 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license this license was previously subject to litigation with the grantor and on june 6 2005 we were ordered to pay 06 million in damages and the respective intellectual property license was terminated due to the cancellation of the license we concluded that the intangible asset had no future benefit and as such during the second quarter of 2005 we wrote off the total value of the asset 199 million 12 million after tax this charge has been included as a component of other charges net within the statement of operations the damages of 06 million were subsequently reversed during 2006 

 

should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

 

our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

 

  

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our 

deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

 

the company has undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries and currently believes that there will be no cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings 

 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 2048 million for the year ended december 31 2006 each increase of 20 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

 

  

revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our typical solution requires no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a post shipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is perfunctory we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 

 

  

we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

  we manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and provide valueadded services to our customers our principal products and principal services are set forth below given the inherently global nature of our business the following description of our products customers and distribution sales and services research and development manufacturing and other elements of our business apply for the most part to each of our segments in some instances particular products are targeted for particular segments but none of these products are material in nature to the entire business or an individual segment 

laboratory instruments 

  we make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments including laboratory balances pipettes titrators thermal analysis systems and other analytical instruments the laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 45 of our net sales in 2005 

   our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one tenmillionth of a gram up to 32 kilograms to cover a wide range of customer needs and price points we market our balances in a range of product tiers offering different levels of functionality based on the same technology platform we also manufacture mass comparators which are used by weights and measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the accuracy of reference weights 

  in addition to mettlertoledo branded products we manufacture and sell balances under the brand name “ohaus” ohaus branded products principally target the educational market and other markets in which customers are interested in lower cost a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 

   pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes of liquids in late 2001 we acquired rainin instrument a premier provider of pipetting solutions based in california rainin develops manufactures and distributes advanced pipettes tips and accessories including single and multichannel manual and electronic pipettes rainin maintains service centers in the key markets where customers periodically send in their pipettes for certified recalibrations rainin’s principal end markets are pharmaceutical biotech clinical and academia 

   titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are used in laboratories as well as the food and beverage and other industries our highend titrators are multitasking models which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple vessels our offering includes robotics to automate routine work in quality control applications 

  thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a function of temperature such as weight dimension energy flow and viscoelastic properties thermal analysis systems are used in nearly every industry but primarily in the plastics and polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical industry 

  ph meters measure acidity in laboratory samples we also sell density and refractometry instruments which measure chemical concentrations in solutions in addition we manufacture and sell moisture analyzers which precisely determine the moisture content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate moisture 

   labx our pcbased laboratory software platform manages and analyzes data generated by our titrators and balances labx provides full network capability has efficient intuitive protocols and enables customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the us food and drug administration’s traceability requirements for electronically stored data also known as 21 cfr part 11 we plan to expand labx to include other laboratory instruments 

   our current automated chemistry offerings are focused on key aspects of drug development process including the identification of new lead compounds and optimization of those leads our automated lab reactors in situ analysis systems and virtuallab informatics suite are considered integral to the process development and scaleup activities of our customers we offer a range of technologies including synthesizer tools to support chemists working on lead identification and optimization in addition we provide systems for cleaning up and purifying synthesized products for use in preclinical trials our online measurement technologies based on infrared and laser light enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and crystallization processes in the lab and plant we believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring significant efficiencies to the drug development process enabling our customers to create larger numbers of higher quality candidate compounds and bring them to market faster 

   our process analytics business provides instruments for the inline measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the production process of pharmaceutical biotech beverage microelectronics and chemical companies about half of our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech markets where our customers need fast and secure scaleup and production that meets the validation processes required for gmp good manufacturing processes and other regulatory standards we are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical measurement to control and optimize production processes our solutions include sensor technology for ph dissolved oxygen co 2  conductivity turbidity and toc 

4 and automated systems for calibration and cleaning of measurement points our instruments offer leading multiparameter capabilities and plantwide control system integration which are key for integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure production quality and efficiency with a worldwide network of specialists we support customers in critical process applications compliance and systems integration questions

  we manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and we offer dedicated software solutions for the chemical pharmaceutical and food industries we supply automatic identification and data capture solutions which integrate inmotion weighing dimensioning and identification technologies for transport shipping and logistics customers we also offer heavy industrial scales and related software the industrial instruments business accounted for approximately 42 of our net sales in 2005 

   we offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances such as bench scales and floor scales for weighing loads from a few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail and packages our products are used in a wide range of applications such as counting applications and in formulating and mixing ingredients 

   our industrial scale terminals integrate collected data and control and automate manufacturing processes they allow users to remotely download programs or access setup data and can minimize down time through predictive rather than reactive maintenance 

   we are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and data capture solutions which integrate inmotion weighing dimensioning and identification technologies with these solutions customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of packages for appropriate billing logistics and quality control our solutions also integrate into customers’ information systems 

   our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing trucks or railcars ie weighing bulk goods as they enter or leave a factory or at a toll station heavy industrial scales are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions we also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle transaction processing 

   we offer a wide range of software that can be used with our industrial instruments examples include freeweighnet statistical quality control software formweighnet our formulationbatching software and overdrive freeweighnet and formweighnet provide full network capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the us food and drug administration’s traceability requirements for electronically stored data 21 cfr part 11 in addition our qi365 software controls batching processes by monitoring the material transfer control process qi365 also provides statistical diagnostic and operational information for asset management process control and database applications 

   increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more and more sophisticated endof line inspection systems eg for use in food processing and packaging and pharmaceutical and other industries we are a leading global provider of metal detectors xray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection helps detect nonmetallic contamination such as glass stones and pits which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons our xray systems can detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control both xray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics freeweighnet is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling monitors weightrelated data and integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise resource planning andor process control systems 

retail weighing solutions 

  supermarkets hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods such as meats vegetables fruits and cheeses we offer standalone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing in addition we offer networked scales and software which can integrate backroom counter selfservice and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system customer benefits are in the areas of pricing merchandising inventory management and regulatory compliance the retail business accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in 2005 

   our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for instore item and inventory management solutions softechnics’ offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food retailers by providing the full scope of realtime item management retailers can then match local store inventory levels with local customer demand as our traditional retail weighing business extends further into the area of information technology the opportunity to crosssell softechnics’ software and services expands we continue to introduce softechnics software for the improved inventory management of fresh goods and plan to sell more complete and integrated data management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future 

customers and distribution 

  our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food producers food retailers the beverage industry specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic market 

  our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2 of 2005 net sales 

sales and service 

   we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers each market organization has the flexibility to 

6 adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 

  we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2005 our sales and services group consisted of over 4800 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 35 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business with a consistent global approach 

   we have expanded our service business from one centered on repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other valueadded services which we call service xxl we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location throughout the world this global service network also is an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in 2005 service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales a significant portion of this amount is derived from sales of replacement parts 

  beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

   our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations which specialize in specific products on a global basis our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

   we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2431 million in research and development 819 million in 2005 832 million in 2004 and 780 million in 2003 in 2005 we spent approximately 55 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

   we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ it systems we 

7 closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 800 employees in research and development and product engineering 

   we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom and china laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are produced worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs 

  we generally manufacture only critical components ourselves usually components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with others for certain components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronics are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

  our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products which helps to limit inventory costs backlog is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

  our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 2728 of our net sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

employees 

  as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8800 employees throughout the world including approximately 4000 in europe 2900 in north and south america and 1900 in asia and other countries 

  we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years except for a strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which has been closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

intellectual property 

  we hold over 1700 patents and trademarks primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and china our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

  our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

8   approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

  our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 

  we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 08 million over the next seven years 

  in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

competition 

  our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

  we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain 

9 these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

  we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

 item 1a risk factors tableend factors affecting our future operating results 

   because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately 1 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2005 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 334 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

   we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant potion of our sales and earnings for example our chinese operations account for 1169 million of sales to external customers and 402 million of segment profit in addition to the currency risks discussed above international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

   we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

11   economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices moreover economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

   our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of whom are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

   we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

   our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures generally any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

   we plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including 

   if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in 

 12 

   any of these acquisitionrelated risks could materially adversely affect our profitability 

  larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

   our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

  we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

   we have employment contracts with each of our key employees in addition our key employees own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

   we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to 

   we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the us and abroad we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the us and abroad in addition some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

   our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

   starting in 2002 our goodwill amortization charges have ceased as of december 31 2005 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4230 million and other intangible assets of 1052 million 

  our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

  in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

  our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biopharma capital spending we currently estimate the fair value of the company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value as of december 31 2005 in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved for example we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 

  should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

  our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

   we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by 

   in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

   we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2005 we had total indebtedness of approximately 1256 million net of cash of 3246 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

  our debt could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 

   our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

overview 

  we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

  net sales in us dollars increased by 6 and 8 in 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations or in local currencies net sales increased 5 and 3 in 2005 and 2004 respectively we faced an improved world economy in 2005 compared to recent years with market conditions generally strong in asia and improved in the united states and europe 

  in respect to our end user markets we experienced improved results during 2005 in our laboratoryrelated end user markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies food and beverage companies and universities we believe that the longterm fundamentals of the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 

  in our industrial markets the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to production capacity although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe in addition to pharmaceutical chemical and transportation and logistics companies food producers and packagers also remain a large part of our industrial customer base in recent years we have benefited from the efforts of food producers and packagers to improve product quality and safety however this sector continues to experience high levels of competitive pressure which may negatively impact customer spending levels 

  in our food retail end markets we experienced strong results in both the us and europe relative to weak activity in recent years traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors increased spending in the past has come from events such as y2k and the introduction of the euro currency we have not experienced similar triggering events in recent years similar to our industrial business china is also an important driver of growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 

21   in 2006 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

  gaining market share our global sales and marketing initiative “spinnaker” continues to be an important growth strategy we aim to reach above market sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broad based initial efforts to improve these processes include the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes increased activities for leads generation and further automation of field processes our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets in addition to traditional services we offer installation calibration regulatory compliance services and remote service support 

  expanding emerging markets we have a twopronged strategy in asia first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have a long track record in china and our sales in asia have grown more than 10 per year in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are shifting more of our manufacturing to china to reduce costs where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

  extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent between 55 and 60 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software 

  maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure during the period following our buyout in 1996 we reduced the number of our manufacturing facilities from 29 to 19 shifting production to china has been an important component of this consolidation we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs 

  pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 

nongaap financial measures 

  we supplement our us gaap results with certain nongaap financial measures the principal nongaap financial measure we use is adjusted operating income which we define as gross profit less research and development selling general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges before amortization interest other charges and taxes the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is earnings before taxes 

  we believe that adjusted operating income is important supplemental information for investors adjusted operating income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by our segments in their reporting to management we use this measure because it excludes amortization interest other charges and taxes which are not allocated to the segments 

  on a consolidated basis we also believe adjusted operating income is an important supplemental method of measuring profitability it is used internally by senior management for setting performance targets for managers and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results we also believe that adjusted operating income is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest rates and effective tax rates and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to intangible assets 

22   adjusted operating income is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings before taxes as an indicator of our performance because of the following limitations 

   our nongaap measure adjusted operating income has certain material limitations as follows 

   adjusted operating income should not be relied upon to the exclusion of us gaap financial measures but reflects an additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed together with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation to earnings before taxes provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 

  because adjusted operating income is not standardized it may not be possible to compare with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or a similar name we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

  our adjusted operating income increased from 1619 million in 2003 to 2067 million in 2005 this performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of 54 million in 2003 this charge is described more fully below a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings for 2003 to 2005 is included in “results of operations” below 

restructuring activities 

  during the first quarter of 2003 we recorded a restructuring charge of 54 million 38 million after tax related to the final union settlement on the closure of our french manufacturing facility this charge comprised the additional employeerelated costs resulting from final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the french workers’ council during the first quarter of 2003 

  we assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing basis during the third quarter of 2003 we recorded a reduction in the restructuring accrual of 10 million included within other charges net as a result of lower employeerelated charges than originally anticipated also a restructuring charge of 14 million was recorded related to an extension of manufacturing consolidation activities this charge comprised severance of 10 million included within other charges net and inventory writedowns of 04 million included within cost of sales 

  at december 31 2003 we had substantially completed the restructuring programs described above 

23 results of operations 

  the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 amounts in thousands 

   a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings follows 

  

 results of operations — consolidated 

   net sales were 14825 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 14045 million in 2004 and 13044 million in 2003 this represents increases in 2005 and 2004 of 6 and 8 in us dollars and 5 and 3 in local currencies respectively excluding exited product lines net sales increased 6 and 4 in local currencies for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  in 2005 our net sales by geographic destination increased in local currencies by 7 in the americas 3 in europe and 9 in asiarest of world a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

24   as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and repair services much of which is provided under contracts as well as sales of spare parts 

  net sales of products increased in 2005 and 2004 by 6 and 7 in us dollars and by 6 and 2 in local currencies respectively service revenue including spare parts increased in 2005 and 2004 by 5 and 11 in us dollars and by 5 and 6 in local currencies respectively 

  net sales for our laboratoryrelated products increased 5 in local currencies during 2005 with strong growth across most product lines particularly process analytics and analytical instruments our sales growth of laboratoryrelated products was also reduced by approximately 1 during 2005 due to the exit of our third party electronic component sales excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations net sales for our laboratoryrelated products increased 4 during 2004 due to growth in each major product category particularly process analytics 

  net sales of our industrialrelated products increased 5 in 2005 in local currencies we experienced increased transportation and logistics project activity as well as sales growth in our core industrial products excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations net sales of industrialrelated products increased 1 during 2004 

  in our food retailing markets net sales increased 8 in 2005 in local currencies over the previous year due to increased sales across all geographic regions particularly in the us related to strong project activity the food retailing markets also continue to experience improved sales growth of our instore retail item management software solutions and expansion of our core retail products into asia net sales in food retailing increased 8 in 2004 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations this increase was due to improvement of customer spending patterns in the us and europe relative to weak activity during the prior year 

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 493 for 2005 compared to 486 for 2004 and 474 for 2003 

  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 532 for 2005 compared to 523 for 2004 and 509 for 2003 gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 360 for 2005 compared to 361 for 2004 and 351 for 2003 

  the increase in gross profit percentage reflects benefits from our sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs our cost rationalization initiatives and the impact of increased pricing these trends were offset in part by unfavorable product mix 

   research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 55 for 2005 compared to 59 for 2004 and 60 in 2003 research and development expenses decreased by 2 in 2005 and increased by 1 in 2004 in local currencies the decrease in 2005 reflects improved productivity timing of projects and our desire to reallocate research and development resources to marketing 

  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 298 for 2005 compared to 299 for 2004 and 286 for 2003 selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 in 2005 and 8 in 2004 in local currencies this increase is due in part to sales and marketing investments in china promotional activities and higher performance related compensation during 2005 compared to 2004 during 2004 we also incurred 50 million related to an investigation into allegations made by an employee with respect to the company and various company processes our spending during 2004 also includes a significant increase in sarbanesoxley regulatory compliance costs including approximately 35 million of external professional fees during 2004 the increases in 2004 also included spending related 

25 to product introductions as well as higher performance related compensation during 2004 compared to 2003 

   other charges net were 202 million in 2005 compared to 01 million in 2004 and 46 million in 2003 other charges net consisted primarily of charges related to interest income gains losses from foreign currency transactions gains losses from sales of assets and other items during 2005 other charges net also included a 218 million charge related to pipette litigation we wrote off a 199 million intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor in june 2005 this license enabled one of our wholly owned subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain thirdparty manufactured pipettes in the united states a judgment entered on june 6 2005 terminated the license agreement and awarded damages to the other party we also incurred 19 million of related legal costs during 2005 which included damages of 06 million during the third quarter we appealed the trial court decision litigation concerning the license and related issues is ongoing between us and the other party to the license we do not believe that the litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in 2004 we had 139 million in sales of these thirdparty manufactured pipettes in the us which had declined 28 since 2001 we expect to minimize any impact to our sales and profitability by increasing the sales of our own higher margin pipettes including those we already manufacture and sell outside the united states 

  the 2003 amount included restructuring charges of 54 million 38 million after tax comprising severance asset writedowns and other exit costs primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers described more fully in “restructuring activities” above 

   interest expense was 149 million for 2005 compared to 129 million for 2004 and 142 million for 2003 the increase in 2005 was principally due to higher average borrowings the decrease in 2004 was primarily due to lower average borrowings compared to 2003 which was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate 

  pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 we repatriated 396 million of cash during 2005 that was generated over time by our foreign operations as a result of this repatriation the company recorded additional income tax expense of 131 million this amount reflects the federal tax impact in the united states including certain state taxes of 123 million foreign withholding taxes of 20 million and a net decrease of 12 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of preexisting and future dividend repatriations in addition the company recorded tax benefits of 77 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters our tax rate for 2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the previously described pipette litigation excluding the tax effects of the previously described earnings repatriation tax audit settlements and pipette litigation our annual effective tax rate would have been 30 for 2005 including these items our annual effective tax rate was 32 and 30 for 2005 and 2004 respectively 

   earnings before taxes were 1602 million for 2005 compared to 1542 million in 2004 and 1369 million in 2003 net earnings were 1089 million for 2005 compared to 1080 million in 2004 and 958 million in 2003 

  the 2005 results included a net 54 million after tax expense related to the two previously described tax items and a onetime 131 million after tax charge related to the pipette litigation described above the 2004 results included 50 million 35 million after tax related to the previously mentioned investigation and 35 million 25 million after tax of external professional fees related to sarbanesoxley regulatory compliance costs the 2003 results included the 54 million 38 million after tax restructuring charge as 

26 previously described the increase in net earnings excluding these items reflected improved sales volume in 2005 and the benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 

   see “nongaap financial measures” above adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development selling general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges before amortization interest expense and other charges increased to 2067 million or 139 of net sales in 2005 compared to 1794 million or 128 of net sales for 2004 and 1619 million or 124 of net sales in 2003 adjusted operating income included restructuring charges of 54 million in 2003 

  adjusted operating income increased in 2005 and 2004 as a result of our increased sales volume and benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives this performance was achieved while we continued to invest in sales and marketing and our field service infrastructure 

results of operations — by operating segment 

  the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have five reportable segments us operations swiss operations western european operations chinese operations and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

   

   the increase in 2005 in total net sales reflected improved sales to external customers across most product lines including particularly strong results in our food retailing and transportation and logistics products due to significant project activity as well as solid growth in laboratory balances process analytics and analytical instruments in 2004 our us operations segment benefited from improved market conditions as well as new product introductions the 2004 increase in net sales to external customers reflected growth in most products particularly our food retailing end markets primarily due to improved results relative to weak project activity in 2003 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 38 million in our us operations segment during 2005 compared to an increase of 30 million during 2004 the increase in segment profit or adjusted operating income of our us operations segment during 2005 is due to an increase in sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable product mix the increase in segment profit or adjusted operating income of our us operations segment during 2004 reflects an increase in sales volume and benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 

   

 27   total net sales in local currency increased 4 in 2005 and 3 in 2004 net sales to external customers in local currency decreased 4 in 2005 and 3 in 2004 the exit of our third party electronic component product line reduced total net sales by approximately 1 in 2005 and 4 in 2004 the decrease in sales to external customers during 2005 and 2004 related primarily to the exit of our third party electronic component product line combined with reduced food retailing project activity and reduced direct export sales to emerging markets partially offset by a strong increase in our industrialrelated products the decrease in 2004 was partially offset by an increase in our food retailing products 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 59 million in our swiss operations segment during 2005 compared to an increase of 75 million during 2004 the increase in segment profit or adjusted operating income primarily related to increased sales to other segments of laboratoryrelated products as well as benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives the 2004 increase was impacted by increased sales to other segments 

   

   total net sales in local currency increased 6 in 2005 and 0 in 2004 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 3 in 2005 and 0 in 2004 the 2005 increase was primarily due to improved market conditions in the major european economies particularly germany we experienced sales growth in 2005 across most product lines particularly laboratoryrelated products our 2004 local currency net sales to external customers in our western european segment primarily reflected growth in our laboratoryrelated products and our food retailing end markets these trends were offset by a decline in our industrialrelated products which included a decrease in transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003 project activity 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 53 million in our western european operations segment during 2005 compared to an increase of 99 million in 2004 the increase in segment profit or adjusted operating income in 2005 is principally a result of increased net sales and benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives the 2004 increase is primarily the result of reduced restructuring charges as well as benefits from our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives improved sales volume and favorable currency translation fluctuations 

   

   total net sales in local currency increased 8 in 2005 and 27 in 2004 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 12 in 2005 and 23 in 2004 these increases were due to continued sales growth for all product lines in particular industrialrelated products 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 85 million in our chinese operations segment during 2005 compared to an increase of 87 million in 2004 the increase in 2005 segment profit or adjusted operating income is primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume and 

28 leveraging our fixed production costs the increase in 2004 is principally the result of increased sales volume to external customers and other segments and the benefits of product transfer initiatives from our other segments 

   

   total net sales in local currency increased 11 in 2005 and 2 in 2004 net sales to external customers in local currency increased 11 in 2005 and 2 in 2004 this performance reflected increased sales in our other asian pacific eastern european and other north american markets 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 19 million in our other operations segment during 2005 compared to an increase of 22 million during 2004 segment profit or adjusted operating income increased during 2005 primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume the increase in 2004 was primarily due to the increased sales volume to external customers and other segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

  liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2005 we have also increased our debt balance in europe and our cash balance in the united states as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  cash provided by operating activities totaled 1771 million in 2005 compared to 1660 million in 2004 and 1172 million in 2003 the increase in 2005 resulted principally from improved operating results offset in part by approximately 15 million of higher payments relating to 2004 performance related compensation incentives bonus payments cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was impacted by voluntary incremental pension contributions of 100 million to our us pension plan cash provided by operating activities in 2003 reflected voluntary incremental pension contributions of 100 million to the us pension plan and 71 million to our uk pension plan similar to previous years we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of approximately 13 million in 2006 cash provided by operating activities also includes payments for restructuring and related activities in 2005 2004 and 2003 of 20 million 40 million and 168 million respectively 

  the company spent approximately 41 million on acquisitions during 2005 we continue to explore other potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in addition the terms of certain of our acquisitions provide for possible additional earnout payments however we do not currently believe we will make any material payments relating to such earnouts 

  capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 325 million in 2005 279 million in 2004 and 272 million in 2003 we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change in 2006 we will be launching a building project for a new plant in china which will cost in the range of 10 million to 15 million over the next two years 

   on november 7 2005 we entered into a revised credit agreement the “amended credit agreement” which amends and restates the existing credit agreement dated as of november 12 2003 the amended 

29 credit agreement increases the amount that can be borrowed under the facility from 300 million to 450 million extends the maturity date to november 2010 and lowers the margin applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder the remaining terms of the amended credit agreement are substantially the same as under the existing credit agreement the company incurred fees of approximately 09 million in conjunction with amending and restating the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense over five years 

   the 450 million amended credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of november 5 2010 it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa3” by moody’s and is currently set at libor plus 0375 we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the amended credit agreement contains covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of less than 325 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 this also places certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level in addition the amended credit agreement has several events of default including upon a change of control as of december 31 2005 approximately 1462 million was available under the facility the amended credit agreement is unsecured 

   in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

  at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

   the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

  our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2005 

 30   changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

  at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our amended credit agreement and senior notes in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

  we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our amended credit agreement and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

   the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

   we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

   we have a share repurchase program that was announced in february 2004 and updated in november 2004 and november 2005 under the program we have been authorized to buy back up to 100 million of equity shares over the twoyear period ending december 31 2005 an additional 200 million over the twoyear period ending december 31 2006 and an additional 200 million over the twoyear period ending december 31 2007 our share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors 

  during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we spent 1646 million and 1038 million on the repurchase of 3229200 shares and 2208500 shares at an average price of 5094 and 4697 respectively an additional 42 million and 14 million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december 31 2005 and 2004 were cash settled during 2006 and 2005 respectively the company reissued 1261332 shares and 794428 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2005 and 2004 respectively as of december 31 2005 there were 2316 million of remaining equity shares authorized to be repurchased under our plan 

31 offbalance sheet arrangements 

  currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material

  because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 09 million to 11 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2005 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 334 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

taxes 

  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 

  we currently benefit from tax holidays in certain jurisdictions these holidays expire at various dates in the future and may or may not be renewable we do not believe that potential changes in tax benefits from existing tax holidays will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 

  we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our subsidiary mettlertoledo hispeed inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill its 

32 obligations under the njdep order and njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately 08 million over the next seven years 

  in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

inflation 

  inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency us dollar swiss franc and british pound declined by 10 the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 41 million at december 31 2005 as compared with a decrease of 56 million at december 31 2004 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

  we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of these contracts was a 04 million loss and a 04 million gain at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2005 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 13 million as compared with a decrease of 16 million at december 31 2004 conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 14 million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december 31 2005 as compared with a net increase of 17 million at december 31 2004 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

33 critical accounting policies 

  management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

   the net periodic pension cost for 2005 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2005 were 15 million and 1159 million respectively for our us pension plans and 66 million and 4793 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2005 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2005 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 07 million and 252 million respectively 

  pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

  the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2005 the average return on assets assumption was 85 for the us plan and 52 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 39 million after tax 

  the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2005 the average discount rate assumption was 55 for the us plans and 33 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 21 million after tax 

  in 2004 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 100 million to reduce the under funded status of our us and uk pension plans a similar payment was not made during 2005 in the future we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the 504 million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december 31 2005 

  we also have employee stock option plans which are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date no compensation cost has resulted 

34 notes 2 and 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements provide supplemental information including pro forma earnings and earnings per share as if we had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” that methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates including future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options see also statement no 123 revised 2004 issued by the fasb in regards to “stockbased compensation” in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncement 

   as of december 31 2005 inventories were 1502 million 

  we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on forecast usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

   as of december 31 2005 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4230 million and other intangible assets of 1052 million 

  our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

  in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

  our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biotech and pharmaceutical capital spending we currently estimate the fair value of the company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value as of december 31 2005 in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved for example we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 

  as of december 31 2004 our intangible assets included a 199 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license this license was previously subject to litigation with the grantor and on june 6 2005 we were ordered to pay 06 million in damages and the respective intellectual property license was terminated due to the cancellation of the license we concluded that the intangible asset had no future benefit and as such during the second quarter we wrote off the total value of the asset 199 million 12 million after tax this charge has been included as a component of other charges net within the statement of operations 

35   should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

  our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

   income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

  in 2005 and 2004 provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them if we decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in excess of those originally planned we could be subject to additional income tax 

  the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate can be materially affected based on earnings before taxes of 1602 million for the year ended december 31 2005 each increase of 16 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

   revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument our typical solution requires no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products to the extent our solutions have a post shipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is perfunctory we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 

   we generally offer oneyear warranties on most of our products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage 

36 and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

   we offer a wide range of software that can be used with our industrial instruments examples include freeweighnet a statistical quality control software formweigh our formulationbatching software and overdrive freeweighnet and formweigh provide full network capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the us food and drug administration’s traceability requirements for electronically stored data 21 cfr part 11 in addition our qi365 software controls batching processes by monitoring the material transfer control process qi365 also provides statistical diagnostic and operational information for asset management process control and database applications 

   increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more and more sophisticated endofline inspection systems eg for use in food processing and packaging and pharmaceutical and other industries we are the world’s leading provider of metal detectors xray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection helps detect nonmetallic contamination such as glass stones and pits which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons our xray systems can detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control both xray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging 

5 lines checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics freeweighnet is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling monitors weightrelated data and integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise resource planning andor process control systems 

retail weighing solutions 

  supermarkets hypermarkets and other food retail organizations make use of multiple weighing applications for handling fresh goods such as meats vegetables fruits and cheeses we offer standalone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing in addition we offer network scales and software which can integrate backroom counter selfservice and checkout functions and can incorporate weighing data into a supermarket’s overall fresh goods management system customer benefits are in the areas of pricing merchandising inventory management and regulatory compliance the retail business accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in 2004 

   our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for instore item and inventory management solutions softechnics’ offering complements our solutions to food retailers its software provides the full scope of realtime item management thereby allowing retailers to match local store inventory levels with local customer demand as our traditional retail weighing business become more focused on information technology the opportunity to crosssell softechnics’ software and services expands we have begun to introduce softechnics software for the improved management of fresh goods and plan to sell more integrated data management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future 

customers and distribution 

  our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as independent research organizations food producers food retailers the beverage industry specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry the electronics industry and the academic market 

  our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels we have a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 2 of 2004 net sales 

sales and service 

   we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers each market organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 

  we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31 2004 our sales and services group consisted of over 4500 employees in sales marketing and customer service including related administration and postsales technical service located in 37 countries this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business with a consistent global approach 

   we have expanded our service business from one centered on calibration repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other valueadded services which we call service xxl we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in assuring that our instruments are used in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location throughout the world this global service network also is an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world in 2004 service representing service contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales a significant portion of this amount is derived from replacement parts 

  beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 

research and development and manufacturing 

   our research product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations which specialize in specific products on a global basis our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 

   we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years we have invested 2318 million in research and development 832 million in 2004 780 million in 2003 and 706 million in 2002 in 2004 we spent approximately 59 of net sales on research and development our research and development efforts fall into two categories 

   we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ it systems we closely integrate research and development with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 800 employees in research and development and product engineering 

   we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom and china laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are produced worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs 

  we generally manufacture only critical components ourselves usually components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing is more efficient we contract with others for certain components we use a wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate and that there are no material 

7 constraints on the sources and availability of materials from time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronics are generally made globally 

backlog seasonality 

  our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products which helps to limit inventory costs backlog is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 

  our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 2728 of our sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 8700 employees throughout the world including approximately 4100 in europe 3000 in north and south america and 1600 in asia and other countries 

  we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years except for a strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which has been closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 

intellectual property 

  we hold over 1700 patents and trademarks primarily in the united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and china our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 

regulation 

  our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 

  approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments in addition some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 

  our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have 

8 incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 

  we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our subsidiary hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfil all its obligations under the njdep order and hispeed has recently entered into discussions with the njdep about the next steps to be undertaken as a result njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site will be approximately 03 million over the next seven years 

  in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to material environmental liabilities in the future 

competition 

  our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 

  we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality solution offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base of weighing instruments and the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic region product range and customer to remain competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 

  we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well 

9 factors affecting our future operating results 

   we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future as of december 31 2004 we had total indebtedness of approximately 1360 million net of cash of 672 million we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness subject to the restrictions therein 

  our debt could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 

   our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors including those described in this section that are beyond our control 

  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our senior credit facility and the senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

   the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our senior credit facility contain a number of covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 

   our senior credit facility also requires us to meet several financial ratios 

  our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and are subject to the risks in this section the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes or under our senior credit facility an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts 

10 borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 

   because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 09 million to 11 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2004 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 28 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

   we conduct business in many countries including emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe in addition to the currency risks discussed above international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us for instance various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements in addition we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks 

   we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies for example converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 

  economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices moreover economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies adding to the adverse conditions we face in emerging markets we remain committed to emerging markets particularly those in asia latin america and eastern europe however we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

   our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of whom are well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company taken together the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 

   we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner or our products could become technologically obsolete over time which would harm our operating results to remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments in developing new products we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability as a result we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 

   our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical food and beverage and chemical industries consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results in addition the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control including the resources available for purchasing equipment the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures generally any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

   we plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines technologies or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including 

   if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future completing such acquisitions may result in 

   any of these acquisitionrelated risks could materially adversely affect our profitability 

  larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets in addition we may not be able to identify successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future however even if we can do so we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

   our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets our patents may not provide complete protection and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed although we take measures to protect confidential information improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

  we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome and management attention could be diverted if we are unsuccessful in such litigation we may have to pay damages stop the infringing activity andor obtain a license if we fail to obtain a required license we may be unable to sell some of our products which could result in a decline in our revenues 

   we have employment contracts with each of our key employees in addition our key employees own shares of our common stock andor have options to purchase additional shares nevertheless such individuals could leave the company if any key employees stopped working for us our operations could be harmed we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 

   we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to 

   we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the us and abroad we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the us and abroad in addition some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 

   our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with these regulations we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

   starting in 2002 our goodwill amortization charges have ceased as at december 31 2004 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4337 million and other intangible assets of 1265 million 

  our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

  in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is 

13 based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

  our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biopharma capital spending we currently estimate the fair value of the company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of 342 million as of december 31 2004 in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved for example we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 

  the company’s intangible assets include a 199 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license this license is currently subject to litigation with the grantor while the company believes its rights under the license will be upheld if they were not to be upheld expected cash flows generated by the license would be reduced and the related 199 million asset could be impaired causing a noncash charge of up to 14 million after tax management does not believe this outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs not be accurate or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

  our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

   we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by 

   in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 

overview 

  we operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 

  net sales in us dollars increased by 8 and 7 in 2004 and 2003 respectively of which 5 and 7 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations we have continued to face a challenging world economy in 2004 with conditions generally strong in asia and stabilizing to improving in the united states and europe 

  looking forward to 2005 we anticipate overall customer spending patterns to be similar to 2004 with certain differences based on geographic regions in asia we expect continued growth but at a slower level than 2004 specifically we believe growth in china will be less than the 21 growth we experienced in 2004 in the us we expect to see similar customer spending levels to what we saw in 2004 and in europe we expect some improvement from the relatively weak levels of recent years 

  in respect of our end user markets we experienced improved results during 2004 in our laboratoryrelated end user markets such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers we believe that the longterm fundamentals of this market are attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 

  in our industrial markets the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to production capacity although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe food producers and packagers also remain a large part of our industrial customer base in recent years we have benefited from these companies’ efforts to improve product quality and safety however this sector is experiencing high levels of competitive pressure which may negatively impact customer spending levels 

  in our retail end markets we experienced improved results in both the us and europe relative to weak activity in recent years traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors increased spending in the past has come from events such as y2k and the introduction of the euro currency we have not experienced similar triggering events in recent years similar to our industrial business china is also an important driver of growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 

  in 2005 we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years 

  gaining market share we launched a global sales and marketing initiative during 2004 we aim to accelerate our sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes while this initiative is broad based initial efforts to improve these processes include the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes increased activities for leads generation and further automation of field processes our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets in addition to traditional services we offer installation calibration regulatory compliance services and remote service support 

  expanding emerging markets we have a twopronged strategy in asia first to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second to leverage our lowcost manufacturing operations in china we have a long track record in china and our sales in asia have grown at more than 10 per year in local currency since 1999 we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china we are shifting more of our manufacturing to china to reduce costs where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

20   extending our technology lead we continue to focus on product innovation in the last three years we spent between 55 and 60 of net sales on research and development we seek to drive shorter product life cycles as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software 

  maintaining cost leadership we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost basis during the period following our buyout in 1996 we reduced the number of our manufacturing facilities from 29 to 19 shifting production to china has been an important component of this consolidation we have also implemented global procurement programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs 

  pursuing strategic acquisitions while we have not completed a significant acquisition since 2001 acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we have identified life sciences packaging and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 

nongaap financial measures 

  we supplement our us gaap results with nongaap financial measures the principal nongaap financial measure we use is adjusted operating income which we define as gross profit less research and development selling general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges before amortization interest other charges and taxes the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net earnings 

  we believe that adjusted operating income is important supplemental information for investors adjusted operating income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by our segments in their reporting to management we use this measure because it excludes amortization interest other charges and taxes which are not allocated to the segments 

  on a consolidated basis we also believe adjusted operating income is an important supplemental method of measuring profitability it is used internally by senior management for measuring profitability setting performance targets for managers and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results we also believe that adjusted operating income is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest rates and effective tax rates and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to intangible assets 

  adjusted operating income is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance because of the following limitations 

   our nongaap measure adjusted operating income has certain material limitations as follows 

   adjusted operating income should not be relied upon to the exclusion of us gaap financial measures but reflects an additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed together with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation to net earnings provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 

21   because adjusted operating income is not standardized it may not be possible to compare with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or a similar name we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

  our adjusted operating income increased from 1365 million in 2002 to 1794 million in 2004 this performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of 287 million in 2002 this charge is described more fully below a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings for 2002 to 2004 is included in “results of operations” below 

restructuring activities 

  as further described in note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements during the three months ended june 30 2002 we recorded a restructuring charge of 287 million 201 million after tax which comprised severance asset writedowns and other exit costs primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers as a result of these actions we eliminated approximately 18 million of costs from the business we estimate that approximately 6 million of these savings were realized in 2002 8 million in 2003 and 4 million in 2004 

  in accordance with us gaap the charge taken in the second quarter of 2002 related to the exit of our french manufacturing facility was limited to the minimum contractual payment required by french law during the three months ended march 31 2003 we recorded a restructuring charge of 54 million 38 million after tax related to the final union settlement on the closure of this facility this charge comprised the additional employeerelated costs resulting from final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the french workers’ council during the first quarter of 2003 

  we assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing basis during the three months ended september 30 2003 we recorded a reduction in the restructuring accrual of 10 million included within other charges income net as a result of lower employeerelated charges than originally anticipated also a restructuring charge of 14 million was recorded during the three months ended september 30 2003 related to an extension of manufacturing consolidation activities this charge comprised severance of 10 million included within other charges income net and inventory writedowns of 04 million included within cost of sales 

  at december 31 2003 we had substantially completed the restructuring programs described above

 results of operations – consolidated 

   net sales were 14045 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 13044 million in 2003 and 12137 million in 2002 this represents increases in us dollars of 8 and 7 in 2004 and 2003 respectively of which 5 and 7 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  in 2004 our net sales by geographic destination in us dollars increased by 2 in the americas 9 in europe and 19 in asia rest of world of which 9 and 4 in europe and asia rest of world respectively was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 

  as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and repair services much of which is provided under contracts as well as sales of spare parts 

  net sales of products increased in us dollars by 7 and 6 in 2004 and 2003 respectively of which 5 and 7 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations service revenue including spare parts increased in us dollars by 11 and 12 in 2004 and 2003 respectively of which 5 and 9 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations net sales for our laboratoryrelated products increased 4 during 2004 this includes growth in each major product category particularly process analytics our sales growth of laboratoryrelated products was also reduced by approximately 2 during 2004 due to the phaseout of our exit of third party electronic component sales excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations net sales for our laboratoryrelated products decreased 1 during 2003 primarily due to a decrease in drug discovery products as a result of weakness in customer spending 

  net sales of our industrialrelated products increased 1 in 2004 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations we experienced sales growth in our core industrial and packaging products offset by a decrease in sales of transportation and logistics products relative to strong project activity in 2003 while the longterm fundamentals of the market for our transportation and logistics products are strong the timing of projects can impact the yearoveryear comparison significantly excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations net sales of industrialrelated products increased 5 during 2003 

23   in our food retailing markets net sales excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations increased 8 in 2004 over the previous year as customer spending patterns in the us and europe continue to improve relative to weak activity last year retail sales growth also includes improved sales of our instore retail item management software solutions and expansion of our core retail products into asia net sales in food retailing decreased 6 in 2003 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations this decrease was principally due to difficult comparisons relating to strong us project activity in 2002 as well as suppressed spending patterns in europe after the significant euro conversionrelated investments by customers in previous years and weak consumer confidence in major european economies 

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 486 for 2004 compared to 474 for 2003 and 468 for 2002 improvements in the margin over the twoyearperiod reflect the benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives partially offset by adverse currency impacts 

  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 523 for 2004 compared to 509 for 2003 and 508 for 2002 these improvements also reflect the benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives offset by adverse currency impacts 

  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was 361 for 2004 compared to 351 for 2003 and 320 for 2002 the increase in the margin over the two years reflects improved productivity as well as the expansion of higher margin regulatory compliance service sales 

   research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 59 for 2004 compared to 60 for 2003 and 58 in 2002 research and development expenses increased in us dollars by 7 in 2004 and 10 in 2003 of which 6 and 8 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations the increases in 2004 and 2003 are principally due to investments in our new laboratory and other products 

  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 299 for 2004 compared to 286 for 2003 and 274 for 2002 selling general and administrative expenses increased in us dollars by 13 in 2004 and 12 in 2003 of which 5 and 8 was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations during 2004 we incurred 50 million related to an investigation into allegations made by an employee with respect to the company and various company processes our spending also includes a significant increase in sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance costs including approximately 35 million of external professional fees during 2004 the increases in 2004 and 2003 also include spending related to our new product introductions as well as higher performance related compensation during 2004 

   other charges income net were 01 million in 2004 compared to 46 million in 2003 and 282 million in 2002 the 2003 and 2002 amounts include restructuring charges of 54 million 38 million after tax and 287 million 201 million after tax respectively comprising severance asset writedowns and other exit costs primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers described more fully in “restructuring activities” above 

   interest expense was 129 million for 2004 compared to 142 million for 2003 and 172 million for 2002 the decreases are principally due to lower average borrowings 

  the provision for taxes is based upon our effective tax rate for the related periods which was 30 for 2004 and 2003 and 9 for 2002 during the three months ended june 30 2002 we recorded a onetime tax gain of 231 million related to the completion of a tax reorganization program and related tax audits which contributed to an overall lower effective tax rate in 2002 

24   during the fourth quarter of 2002 we began a program of repatriating foreign subsidiary earnings to the united states in a tax efficient manner this program resulted in a repatriation of foreign earnings of 85 million during 2002 100 million during 2003 and a further 5 million in 2004 in addition this program will result in the repatriation of 75 million of foreign earnings over the next few years the 2002 repatriation of 85 million created additional us taxable income resulting in the utilization of certain historical tax attributes related to our us operations and release of the related us federal deferred tax valuation allowance the tax effects related to the future repatriation of 75 million have been accrued 

  the company is currently under examination in various taxing jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations while the company has not yet received any material assessments from these taxing authorities the company believes that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations will not result in an adverse material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

   earnings before taxes were 1542 million for 2004 compared to 1369 million in 2003 and 1104 million in 2002 net earnings were 1080 million for 2004 compared to 958 million in 2003 and 1004 million in 2002 

  the 2004 results include 50 million 35 million after tax related to the previously mentioned investigation and 35 million 25 million after tax of external professional fees related to sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance costs 

  these results also include the restructuring charge of 54 million 38 million after tax in 2003 and the restructuring charge of 287 million 201 million after tax and onetime tax gain of 231 million in 2002 

   see “nongaap financial measures” above adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development selling general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges before amortization interest expense and other charges increased to 1794 million or 128 of net sales for 2004 compared to 1619 million or 124 of net sales in 2003 and 1365 million or 112 of net sales in 2002 adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of 54 million in 2003 and 287 million in 2002 

  adjusted operating income increased in 2004 and 2003 as a result of our increased sales volume benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and a decrease in restructuring charges recorded in 2003 and 2002 these benefits were offset in part by higher research and development costs and selling costs principally related to new products as well as the previously mentioned costs in 2004 associated with the investigation and external professional fees related to sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance 

results of operations – by operating segment 

  the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments we currently have six reportable segments principal us operations other western european operations principal central european operations swiss rd and manufacturing operations asia and other a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

   

   net sales to external customers in our principal us operations segment increased 4 in 2004 compared to a decrease of 3 in 2003 our principal us operations segment benefited from improved market conditions in 2004 as well as new product introductions the 2004 increase in net sales to external customers reflects growth in most products particularly our food retailing end markets 

  the net sales growth in our food retail business was primarily due to improved results relative to weak project activity in 2003 our us food retail sales growth also includes improved sales of our instore retail item management software solutions net sales to external customers of our laboratoryrelated products increased during 2004 due to solid performance of our process analytics end market and growth in our liquid handling products we also experienced increased net sales of industrial related products during 2004 primarily due to improved results in most product lines offset in part by a decrease of approximately 58 million in industrial oem product sales net sales to external customers in our principal us operations segment also benefited by approximately 1 from business transfers from our other segment 

  the decrease in 2003 sales of our principal us operations was primarily the result of a decline in laboratory customer spending as well as a decrease in our retail business due to relative strong 2002 project activity 

  the decrease in segment profit or adjusted operating income of our principal us operations segment during 2004 reflects the impact of our product transfer initiatives on this segment as well as additional costs related to product launches a north american sales meeting held once every five years increased employee healthcare costs and an impairment charge relating to a building held for sale of 13 million during 2004 pertaining to this segment 

  the increase in 2003 segment profit or adjusted operating income is due primarily to the restructuring charge recorded in 2002 of which 118 million relates to this segment adjusted operating income in 2003 was also impacted by the reduced sales volume 

   

   currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales growth to external customers of our other western european operations segment by 10 and 17 in 2004 and 2003 respectively local currency net sales to external customers of our other western european operations segment increased 1 in 2004 compared to a decrease of 1 in 2003 

  western europe benefited from improved market conditions in most countries during 2004 as well as new product introductions our 2004 local currency net sales to external customers in our other western european operations segment primarily reflects growth in our laboratoryrelated products and our food retailing end markets these trends were partially offset by a decline in our industrialrelated products which includes a decrease in transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003 project activity 

  sales trends in 2003 were particularly notable in the major western european economies which faced low consumer confidence our local currency sales decline in 2003 was also the result of the declines in our laboratory and retail end markets partially offset by solid results for packaging and transportation and logistics products the 

26 decline in sales of our european retail end markets in 2003 was partly due to the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in 2001 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 61 million in our other western european operations segment during 2004 compared to an increase of 148 million in 2003 these increases are principally the result of reduced restructuring charges as well as benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and favorable currency translation fluctuations restructuring charges had the effect of reducing adjusted operating income of our other western european operations segment by 44 million and 114 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition this segment benefited in 2004 due to a 11 million reduction of our restructuring related accruals as a result of lower employee related charges than originally anticipated 

   

   currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales growth to external customers of our principal central european operations segment by 9 and 18 in 2004 and 2003 respectively local currency net sales to external customers of our principal central european operations segment increased 1 in 2004 compared to a decrease of 4 in 2003 

  similar to our other western european operations segment central europe benefited from improved market conditions in most countries during 2004 as well as new product introductions our 2004 local currency net sales to external customers in our principal central european segment primarily reflects growth in our laboratoryrelated products and our food retailing end markets these trends were partially offset by a decline in our industrialrelated products which includes a decrease in transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003 project activity 

  sales trends in 2003 were particularly notable in the major central european economies which faced low consumer confidence our local currency sales decline in 2003 was also the result of the declines in our laboratory and retail end markets partially offset by solid results for packaging and transportation and logistics products the decline in sales of our european retail end markets in 2003 was partly due to the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in 2001 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 22 million in our principal central european operations segment during 2004 compared to an increase of 71 million in 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily the result of improved sales volume and favorable currency translation fluctuations the 2003 increase is principally the result of reduced restructuring charges as well as benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and favorable currency translation fluctuations restructuring charges had the effect of reducing adjusted operating income of our principal central european operations segment by 28 million in 2002 

   

   currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales growth to external customers of our swiss rd and manufacturing operations segment by 7 and 14 in 2004 and 2003 respectively local currency net sales to external customers of our swiss rd and manufacturing operations segment decreased 12 in 2004 and 13 in 2003 this decrease is primarily due to the exit of our third party electronic component product line which had the 

27 effect of reducing net sales growth to external customers in this segment by approximately 22 during 2004 excluding the effect of the exit of our third party electronic component product line net sales to external customers increased approximately 10 in local currency primarily due to the benefit of business transfers from our other segment as well as increased sales of laboratory balances and analytical instruments 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 41 million in our swiss rd and manufacturing operations segment during 2004 compared to a decrease of 72 million in 2003 the increase in 2004 is principally the result of increased sales to other segments of laboratoryrelated products benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives and favorable currency translation fluctuations 

   

   currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing our asian segment net sales growth to external customers by 2 and 3 in 2004 and 2003 respectively local currency net sales to external customers in our asian segment increased 19 and 21 in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  the 2004 increase in local currency net sales to external customers in asia reflects 21 growth in china and 9 growth in japan these results compare to a 2003 increase of 40 in china and a decrease of 8 in japan we have continued to experience solid sales growth in china based upon the expansion of their economy as well as returns on investments in our chinese business including the addition of a new manufacturing facility in 2003 despite this significant sales growth our chinese net sales growth to external customers slowed during the fourth quarter of 2004 due to exceptional project activity in the prior year comparable period in addition we believe our chinese customer spending patterns may be reduced as a result of the chinese government’s efforts to slow the chinese economy 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 117 million in asia during 2004 compared to an increase of 86 million in 2003 these increases were primarily due to the increased sales volume to external customers and other segments and the benefits of product transfer initiatives from our other segments 

   

   net sales in local currencies to external customers in our other operating segment was flat in 2004 compared to an increase of 3 in 2003 these results reflect sales growth in geographies such as russia eastern europe and mexico in addition our net sales to external customers in this segment were reduced by approximately 5 due to business transfers to our principal us operations and swiss manufacturing and rd operations segments 

  segment profit or adjusted operating income increased 93 million in 2004 compared to an increase of 50 million in 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily due to favorable currency translation fluctuations the benefits of our cost rationalization programs as well as certain product transfers the 2003 increase was due to the impact of restructuring charges in the prior year and improved sales volume in addition 2002 was also negatively affected by the economic downturn in latin america 

28 liquidity and capital resources 

  liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions 

  cash provided by operating activities totaled 1660 million in 2004 compared to 1172 million in 2003 and 1154 million in 2002 the increase in 2004 resulted principally from increased net earnings and improved management of operating assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was impacted by voluntary incremental pension contributions of 100 million to our us pension plan the increase in 2003 cash provided by operating activities also resulted principally from improved management of operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher restructuring and tax payments cash provided by operating activities in 2003 reflected voluntary incremental pension contributions of 100 million to the us pension plan and 71 million to our uk pension plan cash provided by operating activities in 2002 includes a voluntary contribution of 190 million to the us pension plan similar to previous years we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of 147 million in 2005 cash provided by operating activities also includes payments for restructuring and related activities in 2004 2003 and 2002 of 40 million 168 million and 111 million respectively 

  during 2004 we spent approximately 23 million on acquisitions including additional consideration related to earnout periods associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years the cash portions of these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in addition the terms of certain of our acquisitions provide for possible additional earnout payments however we do not currently believe we will make any material payments relating to such earnouts 

  capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities our capital expenditures totaled 279 million in 2004 272 million in 2003 and 332 million in 2002 we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 

   on november 12 2003 we closed a new fiveyear 300 million credit facility and completed the issuance of 150 million sevenyear senior notes the proceeds from this refinancing were immediately used to repay all of the borrowings under our former credit agreement which was then terminated 

   the 300 million credit facility is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a bullet maturity in november 2008 it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments borrowings under the 300 million credit facility bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently “bbb” by standard  poor’s and “baa3” by moody’s and is currently set at libor plus 06 we must also pay utilization and facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings the 300 million credit facility contains covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of less than 325 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 the facility also places certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level in addition the 300 million credit facility has several events of default including upon a change of control the credit facility is unsecured 

   in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over the sevenyear term of the senior notes 

29   at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

   the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of our consolidated net worth 

  at december 31 2004 our consolidated debt net of cash of 672 million was 1360 million in addition to the senior notes we had borrowings of 461 million under our credit facility and 69 million under various other local arrangements also at december 31 2004 we had 2446 million of availability remaining under the credit facility 

  at december 31 2004 approximately 276 million of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars the balance of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately 254 million changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 

  at december 31 2004 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our credit facility and senior notes agreements in addition we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 

  we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together with liquidity available under our credit facility and local working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

   the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 

  

   we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and fixed assets in the normal course of business due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

   on february 5 2004 we announced a share repurchase program commencing with an initial buyback of up to 100 million over the twoyear period ending december 31 2005 in november 2004 in addition to the 100 million buyback amount the company’s board of directors approved an additional buyback of up to 200 million under its share repurchase program over the twoyear period ending december 31 2006 our share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity business and market conditions the stock price trading restrictions and other factors 

  during the year ending december 31 2004 we spent 1038 million on the repurchase of 2208500 shares at an average price of 4697 

  as of december 31 2004 approximately 10 million stock options were outstanding that are scheduled to expire in october 2006 these options were granted before the company’s initial public offering in connection with the buyout from cibageigy the company expects that these options will be exercised before their expiration date any purchases under the share repurchase program over this time would operate to offset the dilution from these exercises 

   at the april 2004 audit committee meeting management informed the committee that the company had received allegations from an employee as a matter of good corporate governance management recommended and the audit committee agreed to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations the allegations covered a number of accounting disclosure and nonfinancial statementrelated items 

  the audit committee retained independent outside counsel and forensic accountants to conduct an investigation of these matters as well as certain other areas directly or indirectly related to the company’s preparation of its financial statements 

  in august 2004 the company announced the completion of the financial aspects of the investigation and that the audit committee and board of directors concluded there would be no change to the company’s financial statements based on the investigation the board based on the recommendation of the audit committee made changes to improve the leadership and oversight of its financial operations and to reinforce the board’s commitment to maintaining strong corporate governance mr william donnelly who was chief financial officer from 1997 to mid2002 returned from an operating job inside the company to the position of cfo in august 2004 the company has also stated that it plans additional changes to enhance its financial organization as well as the methods by which complaints may be reported 

  all aspects of the audit committee’s investigation are now complete 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 

effect of currency on results of operations 

  because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg   the us dollar the euro other major european currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in 

31 those currencies therefore when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 09 million to 11 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2004 we estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately 28 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 

taxes 

  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 

  our effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were approximately 30 30 and 9 respectively as described in “results of operations — consolidated — interest expense and taxes” 

environmental matters 

  we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 

  we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad our subsidiary hispeed checkweigher co inc “hispeed” is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” signed on june 13 1988 with respect to certain property in landing new jersey gei international corporation “gei” is the other ordered party gei has failed to fulfill all its obligations under the njdep order and hispeed has recently entered into discussions with the njdep about the next steps to be undertaken as a result njdep has agreed with hispeed that the residual contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated the company estimates that the costs of compliance associated with the site will be approximately 03 million over the next seven years 

  in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

inflation 

  inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use including raw materials to manufacture our products the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices moreover there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we 

32 incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 

  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international businesses and a portion of our swiss franc euro exposure on a monthly basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by 10 against all of our currency exposures the fair value of these instruments would decrease by 56 million at december 31 2004 as compared with 45 million at december 31 2003 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under “effect of currency on results of operations” 

  we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements the market value of these contracts at both december 31 2004 and 2003 was 04 million based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2004 a 100basispoint increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of 16 million as compared with a decrease of 19 million at december 31 2003 conversely a 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would result in a 17 million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments as compared with a net increase of 19 million at december 31 2003 any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 

critical accounting policies 

  management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to pensions and other postretirement benefits inventories intangible assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

   the net periodic pension cost for 2004 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2004 were 25 million and 1074 million respectively for our us pension plans and 71 million and 4653 million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic postretirement cost for 2004 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2004 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were 10 million and 263 million respectively 

33   pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 

  the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees consequently no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2004 the average return on assets assumption was 85 for the us plan and 52 for the international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 40 million after tax 

  the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are set by benchmarking against highquality corporate bonds for 2004 the average discount rate assumption was 575 for the us plans and 42 for the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist a decrease in the discount rate of 1 would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 16 million after tax 

  in 2004 and 2003 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of 100 million and 171 million respectively to reduce the underfunded status of our us and uk pension plans as a result of these voluntary incremental pension payments we do not expect to make any significant required pension payments during the next two years however if the equity markets do not mirror expected rates of return in the future we could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the 469 million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december 31 2004 

  the company also has employee stock option plans which are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date no compensation cost has resulted notes 2 and 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements provide supplemental information including pro forma earnings and earnings per share as if the company had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” that methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates including future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options see also statement no 123 revised 2004 issued by the fasb in regards to “stock based compensation” in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements 

   as of december 31 2004 inventories net of allowances were 1565 million 

  we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

   as of december 31 2004 our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 4337 million and other intangible assets of 1265 million 

  our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

34   in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors including operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

  our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biotech and pharmaceutical capital spending we currently estimate the fair value of the company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of 342 million as of december 31 2004 in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved for example we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 

  the company’s intangible assets include a 199 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license this license is currently subject to litigation with the grantor while the company believes its rights under the license will be upheld if they were not to be upheld expected cash flows generated by the license would be reduced and the related 199 million asset could be impaired causing a noncash charge of up to 14 million after tax management does not believe this outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs not be accurate or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 

  our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 

   income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

  in 2002 and 2004 provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them if we decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in excess of those originally planned we could be subject to additional income tax 

  the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate can be materially affected based on pretax income of 1542 million for the year ended december 31 2004 each increase of 15 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1 

   revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly title transfers upon shipment in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications mettlertoledo does not sell its software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the company’s typical solution requires no significant production modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions to the extent the company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation such as customer acceptance revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed in addition we also defer revenue where installation is required unless such installation is perfunctory distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 

   the company generally offers oneyear warranties on most of its products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold could be affected

visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries
metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal
that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the
manufacturing process itself xraybased vision inspection helps detect
nonmetallic contamination such as glass stones and pits which enter the
manufacturing process for similar reasons our xray systems can detect
metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control both xray
and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as
components of integrated packaging lines checkweighers are used to control
the filling content of packaged goods such as food pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics freeweighnet is our statistical and quality control software
that optimizes package filling monitors weightrelated data and integrates
it in real time into customers enterprise resource planning andor process
control systems the packaging business accounted for approximately 13 of
our net sales in 2003

process analytics

     our process analytics business provides instruments for the inline
measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the production process
of pharmaceutical biotech and chemical companies about half of our
process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech markets
where our customers need fast and secure scaleup and production that meets
the validation processes required for gmp good manufacturing processes
and other regulatory standards we are the leading supplier of ph and
oxygen measurement instruments used in biotech and pharmaceutical
biopharma manufacturing the process analytics business accounted for
approximately 5 of our net sales in 2003

customers and distribution

     our principal customers include companies in the following key end
markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies
as well as independent research organizations food producers food
retailers the beverage industry specialty chemicals and cosmetics
companies the transportation and logistics industry the metals industry
the electronics industry and the academic market

     our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels
generally more technically sophisticated products are sold through our
direct sales force while less complicated products are sold through
indirect channels our sales through direct channels exceed our sales
through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the
americas is generated through the indirect channels we have a diversified
customer base with no single customer accounting for more than 3 of 2003
net sales

sales and service

market organizations

     we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the
world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service the
market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed
to maintain close relationships with our customers each market
organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts
to account for different cultural and economic conditions market
organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described
below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development
initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas

     we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
organizations among precision instrument manufacturers at december 31
2003 our sales and services group consisted of over 4400 employees in
sales marketing and customer service including related administration
and postsales technical service located in 37 countries this field
organization has the capability to provide service and support to our
customers and distributors in major markets across the globe this is
important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business
with a consistent global approach

service

     we have expanded our service business from one centered on
calibration repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance
and other valueadded services which we call service xxl we have a unique
offering to our pharmaceutical customers in assuring that our instruments
are used in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these
services regardless of the customers location throughout the world this
global service network also is an important factor in our ability to expand
in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest installed base of
weighing instruments in the world in 2003 service representing service
contracts repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately 22
of our total net sales a significant portion of this amount is derived
from replacement parts

     beyond revenue opportunities we believe service is a key part of our
solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention the close
relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us
with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas

research and development and manufacturing

producing organizations

     our research product development and manufacturing efforts are
organized into a number of producing organizations which specialize in
specific products on a global basis our focused producing organizations
help reduce product development time and costs improve customer focus and
maintain technological leadership the producing organizations work
together to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface
and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and
producing organizations

research and development

     we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to
provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and
new applications over the last three years we have invested 2132
million in research and development 780 million in 2003 706 million
in 2002 and 646 million in 2001 in 2003 we spent approximately 60
of net sales on research and development our research and development
efforts fall into two categories

  o  technology advancements which increase the value of our products
     these advancements may be in the form of enhanced functionality new
     applications for our technologies more accurate or reliable
     measurement additional software capability or automation through
     robotics or other means and

  o  cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products
     through better overall design

     we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and
development budget to software development this includes software to
process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments
applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions
into customers it systems we closely integrate research and development
with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 830
employees in research and development and product engineering

manufacturing

     we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities principally in the
united states switzerland germany the united kingdom and china
laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser
extent in the united states and china while our remaining products are
produced worldwide we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing
operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and
exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is
integrated into each step of the manufacturing process all major
manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001 certification we believe
that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and
currently anticipated needs

     we generally manufacture only critical components ourselves usually
components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing
is more efficient we contract with others for certain components we use a
wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate
and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability
of materials from time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our
requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronics
are generally made globally

business segments

     we have six reportable segments principal us operations other
western european operations principal central european operations swiss
rd and manufacturing operations asia and other in previous reporting
periods results from asia were included within the other operating
segment segment disclosure for 2002 and 2001 has been reclassified
accordingly see note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements
and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations under results of operations  by operating segment
for detailed results by segment and geographic region

     we manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and provide
value added services to our customers our principal products and principal
services are set forth above given the inherently global nature of our
business the above description of our products customers and
distribution sales and services research and development manufacturing
and other elements of our business apply for the most part to each of our
segments in some instances particular products are targeted for particular
segments but none of these are material in nature to the entire business or
an individual segment

backlog seasonality

     our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so
as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products
which helps to limit inventory costs backlog is therefore generally a
function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer
than one to two months

     our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal
variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business
traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and
sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second
and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated
approximately 2728 of our sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect
on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread
evenly across all quarters

employees

     as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 8650 employees
throughout the world including approximately 4180 in europe 3000 in
north and south america and 1470 in asia and other countries

     we believe our employee relations are good and we have not suffered
any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years
except for a strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which
has been closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our
employees

intellectual property

     we hold over 1700 patents and trademarks primarily in the united
states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and china
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological
innovations some of which are protected by patents of various durations
products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents and
as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to our
business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo name
and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect against
infringement of our intellectual property

regulation

     our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals
by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical
components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we
are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations

     approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly
influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other
instruments in addition some of our products are used in legal for
trade applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and
for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although
there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there
is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and
measures regulation is harmonized across the european union

     our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on
the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically
subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good
manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and
drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing
industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point
haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be
subject to special requirements

environmental matters

     we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties
and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our
competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and
operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and
regulations in both the united states and abroad

     we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect
to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in
both the united states and abroad our subsidiary hispeed checkweigher
is subject to an administrative consent order from the new jersey
department of environmental protection that provides for the remediation of
a former manufacturing site in landing new jersey under the terms of the
stock purchase agreement between gei international corporation and the
predecessor to hispeed gei assumed all responsibility for the
administrative consent order and to date has performed and paid for all
action it requires

     in addition certain of our present and former facilities have or had
been in operation for many decades and over such time some of these
facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes
which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that these sites
as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent
wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject of
remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have
not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental
matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional
environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material
adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or
competitive position in the market

competition

     our markets are highly competitive weighing and analytical
instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application
particularly the industrial and food retailing markets as a result we
face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well
established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are
divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in
our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and
geographic markets

     we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their products and to introduce new products with
competitive prices although we believe that we have technological and
other competitive advantages over many of our competitors we may not be
able to realize and maintain these advantages these advantages include our
worldwide market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our
track record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality
solution offering our global sales and service offering our large
installed base of weighing instruments and the fact that our revenue base
is diversified by geographic region product range and customer to remain
competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales
and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we
will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or
that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any
competitive advantages

     we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets
for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support
service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater
demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor
than in developed markets competition in the us laboratory market is
also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only
our products but those of our competitors as well

item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
          and results of operations

     the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated
financial statements

overview

     we operate a global business with net sales that are diversified by
geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions
worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several
factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our
comprehensive solution offering the quality of our global sales and
service network our continued investment in product development our
pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on
opportunities in developed and emerging markets

     net sales in local currencies were flat in 2003 compared to an
increase of 3 in 2002 as discussed in acquisition of rainin instrument
below 2002 includes the benefit of the rainin acquisition during 2003 we
continued to face a challenging world economy and political environment
with conditions generally strong in asia improving in the united states
but remaining weak in europe

     specifically we were affected by the unexpected softness in our
biotech and pharmaceutical biopharma end user markets particularly in
our higher price point drug discovery product line biopharma firms are
facing shortterm pressures such as new drug approval activity heightened
price regulation and industry consolidation however we believe that the
longterm fundamentals of this market are strong as demonstrated by 12
compound annual growth rate in research and development spending over the
last 30 years an aging world population with more discretionary healthcare
spending capacity drives the need for biopharma companies to improve both
scale and productivity in new drug research and development which often
requires products that mitigate bottlenecks in chemistryoriented
solutions which mettlertoledo can provide

     in our industrial markets there is an accelerating trend of
multinational companies investing in production in china to take advantage
of cost savings although this provides a significant opportunity for our
china operations this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on our
industrial related businesses in the us and europe

     in our retail end markets spending patterns continued to be
suppressed in europe after the significant euro conversion related
investments by customers in 2001 and weak consumer confidence in major
european economies in our us retail business results were down relative
to strong 2002 project activity

     in spite of these external challenges we continued to build for the
future by investing in strong new marketing programs to further penetrate
our markets and leading customers turning our record rd investments into
new product launches growing our chinese operations into our third largest
global market expanding our unique services offering and improving our
cost structure

     looking forward to 2004 we anticipate a gradual improvement in our
customers spending patterns in asia we expect further strong economic
growth and in the us we expect the economic improvements experienced
over the last several months to continue we remain concerned however about
europe where the major economies face low consumer confidence a strong
euro and lack of structural government reforms

     in terms of our key earnings growth drivers for 2004 we expect to
benefit from the introduction of new products this follows our significant
investment in research and development over the last few years
particularly in respect of our industrial and laboratory end markets we
also expect continued growth opportunities for most of our product lines in
china as our global customers develop in this region and as we expand our
geographic sales and service coverage we also anticipate further sales
growth in our service business as we continue to extend our regulatory and
compliance service offerings finally we expect to generate a further 4
million incremental savings from our cost reduction programs in 2004

     more generally we believe our sales growth over the next several
years will come primarily from our solutions approach to the principal
challenges facing our customer base these include the need for increased
efficiency for example in accelerating time to market for new products
achieving better yields improving work processes and outsourcing noncore
activities the desire to integrate information captured by instruments
into management information systems the drive for ever higher quality of
our customers products and services including the need to adhere to
stringent regulatory and industry standards and the move towards
globalization in all major customer groups

     acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy our
acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network respected brand
name extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we are
particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or
increase our solutions capability in addition we continue to focus on the
following end markets drug discovery process analytics food and drug
packaging and transportation and logistics

nongaap financial measures

     we supplement our us gaap results with nongaap financial measures
the principal nongaap financial measure we use is adjusted operating
income we define adjusted operating income as gross profit less research
and development selling general and administrative expenses and
restructuring charges before amortization interest other charges and
taxes the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net
earnings

     we believe that adjusted operating income is important supplemental
information for investors adjusted operating income is used internally as
the principal profit measurement by our segments in their reporting to
management we use this measure because it excludes amortization interest
other charges and taxes which are not allocated to the segments

     on a consolidated basis we also believe adjusted operating income is
an important supplemental method of measuring profitability it is used
internally by senior management for measuring profitability setting
performance targets for managers and has historically been used as one of
the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results we
also believe that adjusted operating income is an important performance
measure because it provides a measure of comparability to other companies
with different capital or legal structures which accordingly may be subject
to disparate interest rates and effective tax rates and to companies which
may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to
intangible assets

     adjusted operating income is used in addition to and in conjunction
with results presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted operating
income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and
should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator
of our performance because of the following limitations

limitations of our nongaap measure adjusted operating income

our nongaap measure adjusted operating income has certain material
limitations as follows

o    it does not include interest expense because we have borrowed money
     to finance some of our operations interest is a necessary and ongoing
     part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue therefore
     any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations

o    it does not include taxes because payment of taxes is a necessary and
     ongoing part of our operations any measure that excludes taxes has
     material limitations

o    it excludes amortization expense and other charges because these
     items are recurring any measure that excludes them has material
     limitations

     adjusted operating income should not be relied upon to the exclusion
of us gaap financial measures but reflects an additional measure of
comparability and means of viewing aspects of our operations that when
viewed together with our us gaap results and the accompanying
reconciliation to net earnings provides a more complete understanding of
factors and trends affecting our business

     because adjusted operating income is not standardized it may not be
possible to compare with other companies nongaap financial measures
having the same or a similar name we strongly encourage investors to
review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their
entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

     our adjusted operating income increased from 1499 million in 2001 to
1619 million in 2003 this performance was achieved while we continued to
invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing
infrastructure adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of
152 million in 2001 287 million in 2002 and 54 million in 2003
these charges are described more fully below a reconciliation of adjusted
operating income to net earnings for 2001 to 2003 is included in results
of operations below

acquisition of rainin instrument

     in november 2001 we acquired rainin instrument based in california
usa rainin is a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used in
pharmaceutical biotech and medical research applications rainin has a
market leadership position in north america a truly differentiating
technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting
ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs this acquisition further
broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences
market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers assuming
we acquired rainin as of the beginning of 2001 the acquisition would have
added sales of approximately 65 million adjusted operating income of
approximately 20 million and diluted earnings per share of negative 001
for 2001 on a pro forma basis

cost reduction programs

     in 2001 we recorded a restructuring charge of 152 million 146
million after tax associated primarily with headcount reductions and
manufacturing transfers this charge comprised primarily severance and
other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities including lease
termination costs and the writedown of impaired assets

     as further described in note 15 to our audited consolidated financial
statements during the three months ended june 30 2002 we recorded a
restructuring charge of 287 million 201 million after tax which
comprised severance asset writedowns and other exit costs primarily
related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers as a result of
these actions we expect to eliminate approximately 18 million of costs
from the business we estimate that approximately 6 million of these
savings were realized in 2002 8 million in 2003 and a further 4 million
is expected in 2004

     as noted in previous filings in accordance with us gaap the charge
taken in the second quarter of 2002 related to the exit of our french
manufacturing facility was limited to the minimum contractual payment
required by french law during the three months ended march 31 2003 we
recorded a restructuring charge of 54 million 38 million after tax
related to the final union settlement on the closure of this facility this
charge comprises the additional employeerelated costs resulting from final
settlement of the social plan negotiated with the french workers council
during the first quarter of 2003

     we assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing
basis during the three months ended september 30 2003 we recorded a
reduction in the restructuring accrual of 096 million included within
other charges income net as a result of lower employeerelated charges
than originally anticipated also a restructuring charge of 14 million
was recorded during the three months ended september 30 2003 related to
an extension of manufacturing consolidation activities this charge
comprised severance of 10 million included within other charges
income net and inventory writedowns of 04 million included within
cost of sales

     the companys aforementioned restructuring programs and related
accruals were substantially completed at december 31 2003

results of operations  consolidated

     net sales

     net sales were 13044 million for the year ended december 31 2003
compared to 12137 million in 2002 and 11480 million in 2001 in local
currencies this represents flat sales for 2003 and an increase of 3 in
2002 the fluctuation of the us dollar versus our major trading
currencies increased us dollarreported sales growth in 2003 and 2002
net sales in us dollars increased 7 in 2003 and 6 in 2002

     2003 sales were affected by the unexpected softness in our biopharma
end user market particularly in our higher price point drug discovery
product line spending patterns in our retail end markets continued to be
suppressed in europe after the significant euro conversion related
investments by customers in 2001 and down in the us relative to strong
2002 project activity these trends were partially mitigated by solid
results in our industrial markets particularly for packaging and
transportation and logistics products

     as discussed in acquisition of rainin instrument above results for
2002 include the benefit of the rainin acquisition however we also
experienced a sharp decline in sales of our european retail products in
2002 as a result of the euro conversion related investments by customers
in 2001 excluding the impact of european retail products in both 2002 and
2001 consolidated local currency sales growth would be 9 in 2002 a
discussion of sales by operating segment is included below

     as described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements our
net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related
services service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance
qualification calibration certification and repair services much of
which is provided under contracts as well as sales of spare parts

     net sales of products declined 1 in local currencies in 2003 and
increased 2 in 2002 whereas service revenue including spare parts
increased 3 and 8 in 2003 and 2002 respectively the higher service
growth was generated by our consultative based valueadded services
approach including the provision of instrument qualification and asset
management services and training rather than via increased sales of spare
parts

     gross profit

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 474 for 2003 compared
to 468 for 2002 and 461 for 2001 improvements in the margin over the
two year period reflect the benefits from our cost rationalization and
product transfer initiatives partially offset by adverse currency impacts
on a constant currency basis relative to the prior year gross margin as a
percentage of net sales was 478 for 2003

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 509 for
2003 compared to 508 for 2002 and 499 for 2001 these improvements
also reflect the benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives offset
by adverse currency impacts on a constant currency basis relative to the
prior year product gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 514 for
2003

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including
spare parts was 351 for 2003 compared to 320 for 2002 and 313 for
2001 the increase in the margin over the two years reflects the expansion
of higher margin regulatory compliance service sales and improved
productivity on a constant currency basis relative to the prior year
service gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 349 for 2003

     research and development and selling general and administrative
expenses

     research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was
60 for 2003 compared to 58 for 2002 and 56 in 2001 in local
currencies research and development expenses increased 2 in 2003 and 5 in
2002 compared to the previous year the increase in 2003 is principally due
to investments in our new laboratory and transportation and logistics
products

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 286 for 2003 compared to 274 for 2002 and 261 for
2001 in local currencies and adjusting for acquisitions selling general
and administrative expenses increased 3 in 2003 and 2 in 2002 the
increase in 2003 is principally due to higher medical plan costs in the
us and higher marketing costs related to the rollout of our new
laboratory products

     other charges income net

     other charges income net were 46 million in 2003 compared to
282 million in 2002 and 154 million in 2001 the 2003 2002 and 2001
amounts include the restructuring charges of 54 million 38 million
after tax 287 million 201 million after tax and 152 million
146 million after tax comprising severance asset writedowns and
other exit costs primarily related to headcount reductions and
manufacturing transfers described more fully in cost reduction programs
above

     interest expense and taxes

     interest expense was 142 million for 2003 compared to 172 million
for both 2002 and 2001 the decrease in 2003 is principally due to reduced
borrowing rates and lower average borrowings over the year in 2002
reduced interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings used to
fund the rainin acquisition

     the provision for taxes is based upon our effective tax rate for the
related periods this rate was 30 for 2003 9 for 2002 and 39 for 2001
the reduction from 39 to 30 reflects the effects of a restructuring of
our european operations and other tax initiatives in addition during the
three months ended june 30 2002 we recorded a onetime tax gain of 231
million related to the completion of a tax reorganization program and
related tax audits

     during the fourth quarter of 2002 we began a program of repatriating
foreign subsidiary earnings to the united states in a tax efficient manner
this program resulted in a repatriation of 85 million of foreign earnings
during 2002 and a further 100 million in 2003 in addition this program
will result in the repatriation of 80 million of foreign earnings over the
next few years the 2002 repatriation of 85 million created additional
us taxable income resulting in the utilization of certain historical tax
attributes related to our us operations and release of the related us
federal deferred tax valuation allowance the 2003 repatriation of 100
million also utilized certain historical us tax attributes the tax
effects related to the future repatriation of 80 million are also accrued

     earnings before taxes and net earnings

     earnings before taxes were 1369 million for 2003 compared to 1104
million in 2002 and 1184 million in 2001 net earnings were 958 million
for 2003 compared to 1004 million in 2002 and 723 million in 2001

     these results include the restructuring charge of 54 million 38
million after tax in 2003 the restructuring charge of 287 million
201 million after tax and the onetime tax gain of 231 million in
2002 and the restructuring charge of 152 million 146 million after
tax in 2001

     supplemental data adjusted operating income

     see nongaap financial measures above adjusted operating income
gross profit less research and development selling general and
administrative expenses and restructuring charges before amortization
interest expense and other charges increased to 1619 million or 124
of net sales for 2003 compared to 1365 million or 112 of net sales
in 2002 and 1499 million or 131 of net sales in 2001 adjusted
operating income includes restructuring charges of 54 million in 2003
287 million in 2002 and 152 million in 2001

     in 2003 adjusted operating income increased primarily as a result of
the lower restructuring charge relative to 2002 the related benefits of
our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and strong sales
and manufacturing productivity improvements in china were offset by higher
research and development costs and selling costs principally related to
investments in new products as well as higher medical plan costs in the
us in 2002 adjusted operating income decreased primarily due to
recording a higher restructuring charge relative to 2001 and the
aforementioned volume impact on european retail following the euro
conversion related investments by customers in 2001 partially offset by
the benefit of the rainin acquisition a discussion of adjusted operating
income by operating segment is included below

results of operations  by operating segment

     principal us operations

     net sales to external customers in our principal us operations
segment decreased 3 in 2003 compared to an increase of 22 in 2002
although not as significant as in europe we experienced slightly lower
sales in our laboratory business in the us in 2003 due to reduced
spending in our biopharma end market in addition retail sales declined
relative to strong project activity in 2002 these trends were partially
offset by increased sales of packaging products the increase in 2002 is
principally due to the rainin acquisition approximately 86 of rainins
operations were based in the americas in 2002

     adjusted operating income increased 115 million in our principal
us operations in 2003 compared to an increase of 320 million in 2002
the increase in 2003 is due primarily to the restructuring charge recorded
in 2002 of which 118 million relates to this segment adjusted operating
income in 2003 was also impacted by lower sales of laboratory and food
retailing products combined with higher medical plan costs relative to
2002 partially offset by the impact of increased sales of packaging
products and improved service profitability the increase in 2002 is due
primarily to the rainin acquisition and improvements in service
profitability partially offset by the impact of restructuring charges of
118 million in 2002 and 60 million in 2001

     other western european operations including france uk italy and
spain

     net sales in local currencies to external customers in our other
western european operations segment decreased 1 in 2003 compared to a
decrease of 7 in 2002 the reduced sales in 2003 were principally due to
lower spending in our biopharma and retail end markets these trends were
partially mitigated by solid results for packaging and transportation and
logistics products our european sales trends in 2002 were primarily the
result of the decline in sales of our european retail products following
the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in 2001

     adjusted operating income increased 148 million in our other western
european operations segment in 2003 compared to a decrease of 229 million
in 2002 the increase in 2003 is principally the result of a lower
restructuring charge of 44 million recorded in 2003 compared to 114
million recorded in 2002 2003 also benefited from the related benefits of
our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives partially offset
by the impact of declines in sales of laboratory and retail products the
decrease in 2002 was principally due to the aforementioned volume impact on
european retail following the euro related investments by customers in
2001 as well as the impact of the restructuring charges of 114 million
in 2002 and 09 million in 2001

     principal central european operations including germany

     net sales in local currencies to external customers in our principal
central european operations segment decreased 4 in 2003 compared to a
decrease of 20 in 2002 similar to our other western european operations
segment the decline in 2003 was principally due to weakness in our
laboratory and retail end markets partially offset by solid results for
packaging and transportation and logistics products the decline in 2002
was principally due to a reduction in posteuro conversion retail sales

     adjusted operating income increased 71 million in our principal
central european operations segment in 2003 compared to a decrease of 168
million in 2002 the increase in 2003 is principally the result of the
lower restructuring charge recorded in 2002 of which 28 million relates
to this segment and the related benefits from our cost rationalization and
product transfer initiatives partially offset by the impact of declines in
sales of laboratory and retail products while 2002 suffered from the
aforementioned volume impact on european retail

     swiss rd and manufacturing operations

     net sales in local currencies to external customers in our swiss rd
and manufacturing operations segment decreased 13 in 2003 compared to a
decrease of 11 in 2002 these declines are principally the result of
reduced sales in our laboratory markets

     adjusted operating income decreased 72 million in our swiss rd and
manufacturing operations segment in 2003 compared to a decrease of 98
million in 2002 these declines were principally as a result of lower sales
in our laboratory markets and increased research and development costs in
both years as well as higher marketing costs in 2003 related to our new
laboratory product launches

     asia

     as disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements
continued growth resulted in the companys reporting units in asia
exceeding the quantitative threshold for disclosure as a separate operating
segment during the three months ended december 31 2003

     net sales in local currencies to external customers in asia increased
21 in 2003 compared to an increase of 11 in 2002 these results reflect
strong sales performance in china for most of our product lines partially
offset by declines in japan as well as expanding our manufacturing
capacity in china we have also significantly increased our local sales and
service resources in asia for example our headcount in asia increased by
19 to 1383 in 2003 selling general and administrative expenses
increased 18 in local currencies in asia in 2003 reflecting the
additional investment in this region and the strong sales performance

     adjusted operating income increased 86 million in asia in 2003
compared to an increase of 41 million in 2002 principally due to
stronger sales and improved manufacturing productivity in china partially
offset by declines primarily in japan

     other

     net sales in local currencies to external customers in our other
operating segment increased 3 in 2003 compared to an increase of 5 in
2002 these results reflect modest sales growth in countries such as russia
and australia and in eastern europe partially offset by a decline in
sales of our drug discovery products

     adjusted operating income increased 50 million in our other
operating segment in 2003 compared to a decrease of 03 million in 2002
these results reflect the impact of restructuring charges offset by the
impact of declines in sales of our drug discovery products in addition
2002 was also negatively affected by the economic downturn in latin
america

liquidity and capital resources

     liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition
liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing therefore
liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that
consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving
longrange business objectives and meeting debt service commitments
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital
requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions

     cash provided by operating activities totaled 1172 million in 2003
compared to 1154 million in 2002 and 1016 million in 2001 the increase
in 2003 resulted principally from improved management of operating assets
and liabilities partially offset by higher restructuring and tax payments
included in 2003 cash provided by operating activities are voluntary
incremental pension contributions of 100 million to the us pension plan
and 71 million to the uk pension plan included in 2002 cash provided
by operating activities is a voluntary contribution of 190 million to the
us pension plan in 2004 similar to previous years we expect to make
normal employer pension contributions of 114 million cash provided by
operating activities also includes payments for restructuring and certain
acquisition integration activities these amounts totaled 168 million
111 million and 107 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

     during 2003 we spent approximately 45 million on acquisitions
including additional consideration related to earnout periods associated
with acquisitions consummated in prior years the cash portions of these
purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional
borrowings we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection
with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in addition
the terms of certain of our acquisitions in 2003 and earlier years provide
for possible additional earnout payments of up to 10 million

     capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made
primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of
facilities our capital expenditures totaled 272 million in 2003 332
million in 2002 and 332 million in 2001 capital expenditures in 2003
include spending of 24 million associated with our new facility in china
and in 2002 include spending of 83 million associated with rainins new
facility in california we expect capital expenditures in 2004 to be
slightly above 2003 we also expect capital expenditures to increase as our
business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change

       november 2003 refinancing

     on november 12 2003 we closed a new fiveyear 300 million credit
facility the 300 million credit facility or the credit facility and
completed the issuance of 150 million sevenyear senior notes the
proceeds from this refinancing were immediately used to repay all of the
borrowings under our former credit agreement which was then terminated

     credit facility agreement

     the 300 million credit facility is provided by a group of financial
institutions and has a bullet maturity in november 2008 it is not subject
to any scheduled principal payments borrowings under the 300 million
credit facility bear interest at current market rates plus a margin which
is based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently bbb by
standard  poors and baa3 by moodys and is currently set at libor plus
06 we must also pay utilization and facility fees that are tied to our
credit ratings the 300 million credit facility contains covenants
including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest tax
depreciation and amortization of less than 325 to 10 and an interest
coverage ratio of more than 35 to 10 the new facility also places
certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or
incur debt at a subsidiary level in addition the 300 million credit
facility has several events of default including upon a change of control
the credit facility is unsecured

     senior notes

     in november 2003 we issued 150 million of 485 unsecured senior
notes due november 15 2010 the senior notes the senior notes rank
equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness interest is
payable semiannually in may and november discount and issuance costs
approximated 12 million and are being amortized to interest expense over
the sevenyear term of the senior notes

     at our option the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at
any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of

  o  the principal amount of the senior notes or

  o  the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
     principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a
     semiannual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus a margin of
     020

     the new sevenyear senior notes contain limitations on the ability to
incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding 10 of
our consolidated net worth

     at december 31 2003 our consolidated debt net of cash of 451
million was 1964 million in addition to the senior notes we had
borrowings of 731 million under our credit facility and 183 million
under various other local arrangements also at december 31 2003 we had
2186 million of availability remaining under the credit facility

     at december 31 2003 approximately 494 million of the borrowings
under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were
denominated in us dollars the balance of the borrowings under the credit
facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain
of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately 420
million changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are
denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a
variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in
exchange rates

     at december 31 2003 we are in compliance with all covenants set
forth in our credit facility and senior notes agreements in addition we
do not have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates
of our debt

     we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities
together with liquidity available under our credit facility and local
working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently
anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at
least several years but there can be no assurance that this will be the
case

     contractual obligations

     the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at
december 31 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on
our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant
outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments

a   as described in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements
b   as described in note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements
c   represents agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company



     we have purchase commitments for materials supplies services and
fixed assets as part of the normal course of business due to the
proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes certain supply
contracts contain penalty provisions we do not expect potential payments
under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or
financial condition this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely
outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business
plans

     share repurchase program

     on february 5 2004 we announced a share repurchase program
commencing with an initial buyback of up to 100 million over the twoyear
period ending december 31 2005 the repurchases will be made through open
market transactions and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition
activity business and market conditions the stock price trading
restrictions and other factors we cannot assure you that we will
repurchase shares representing the full value of the program over the
twoyear period

offbalance sheet arrangements

     currently we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of
operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is
material

effect of currency on results of operations

     because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income
can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our
operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net
sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in
switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover
a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and
general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore
if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading
currencies eg the us dollar the euro other major european
currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also
have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss
franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european
currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also
decreases our operating profits accordingly the swiss franc exchange rate
to the euro is an important crossrate monitored by the company we
estimate that a 1 strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would
result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of 08 million to 12
million on an annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate
movements on operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to
changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the
swiss franc based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2003 we
estimate that a 10 weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in
which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately
47 million in the reported us dollar value of the debt

taxes

     we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of
factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions
the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions
the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings
repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax
liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a
nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined
basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same
jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of
nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we
may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall
basis we incur a net loss for the period

     our effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2003 2002
and 2001 were approximately 30 9 and 39 respectively as described in
interest expense and taxes above

environmental matters

     we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of properties
and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our
competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and
operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and
regulations in both the united states and abroad

     we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect
to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in
both the united states and abroad our subsidiary hispeed checkweigher
is subject to an administrative consent order from the new jersey
department of environmental protection that provides for the remediation of
a former manufacturing site in landing new jersey under the terms of the
stock purchase agreement between gei international corporation and the
predecessor to hispeed gei assumed all responsibility for the
administrative consent order and to date has performed and paid for all
action it requires in addition certain of our present and former
facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such
time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and
disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible
that these sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which
we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject
of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have
not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental
matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional
environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

inflation

     inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use the
competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to
recover higher costs through increased selling prices moreover there may
be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the
major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products
which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed
to operations in china and eastern europe which have experienced
inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have not had a
material effect on our operating results however as our presence in china
and eastern europe increases these inflationary conditions could have a
greater impact on our operating results



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and do not use them for trading purposes

     we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our international
businesses and a portion of our swiss franc  euro exposure on a monthly
basis such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable
currency fluctuations a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar
and swiss franc on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates
that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by 10 against
all of our currency exposures the fair value of these instruments would
decrease by 45 million at december 31 2003 as compared with 29
million at december 31 2002 any resulting changes in fair value would be
offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the
sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange
rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may
overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as
described under effect of currency on results of operations above

     we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements these
contracts are more fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated
financial statements the market value of these contracts as at december
31 2003 and 2002 was 04 million and negative 44 million respectively
based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2003 a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate
market value of these instruments of 19 million as compared with an
increase of 14 million at december 31 2002 conversely a 100 basis
point decrease in interest rates would result in a 19 million increase in
the net aggregate market value of these instruments as compared with a net
reduction of 14 million at december 31 2002 any change in fair value
would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such
agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled

critical accounting policies

     managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues
and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to
pensions and other postretirement benefits inventories intangible
assets income taxes revenue and warranty costs we base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

     we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited
consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our
audited consolidated financial statements

employee benefit plans

     the net periodic pension cost for 2003 and projected benefit
obligation as at december 31 2003 were 37 million and 998 million
respectively for our us pension plans and 111 million and 4025
million respectively for our international pension plans the net periodic
postretirement cost for 2003 and projected benefit obligation as at
december 31 2003 for our us postretirement medical benefit plan were
05 million and 298 million respectively

     pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are
developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations these assumptions
include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in accordance
with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are
accumulated and amortized over future periods while management believes
the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or
changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense

     the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension
plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the
longterm projected return of those assets which represent a diversified
mix of us and international corporate equities and government and
corporate debt securities in april 2002 we froze our us defined benefit
pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
current and all future employees consequently no significant future
service costs will be incurred on these plans for 2003 the average return
on assets assumption was 85 for the us plan and 61 for the
international plans a change in the rate of return of 1 would impact
annual benefit plan expense by approximately 34 million after tax

     the discount rates for defined benefit and postretirement plans are
set by benchmarking against high quality corporate bonds for 2003 the
average discount rate assumption was 625 for the us plans and 45 for
the international plans representing a weighted average of local rates in
countries where such plans exist a change in the discount rate of 1 would
impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately 35 million after tax

     in 2003 and 2002 we made voluntary incremental funding payments of
171 million and 190 million respectively to reduce the underfunded
status of the us and uk pension plans as a result we do not expect to
make any significant required pension funding payments other than normal
employer contributions during the next two years however if the equity
markets do not mirror expected rates of return in the future we could be
required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the 436
million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december 31 2003

     the company also has employee stock option plans which are accounted
for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of
accounting principles opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to
employees and related interpretations as stock options have been issued
with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on
the grant date no compensation cost has resulted note 12 to the audited
consolidated financial statements provides supplemental information
including pro forma earnings and earnings per share as if the company had
accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no
123 accounting for stockbased compensation that methodology yields an
estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates
including future volatility and estimated option lives changes in these
assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock
options

inventory

     as at december 31 2003 net inventories were 1518 million

     we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value
cost which includes direct materials labor and overhead is generally
determined using the first in first out fifo method the estimated
market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing
excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage
orders and technological obsolescence if actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management reductions in the value of
inventory may be required

goodwill and other intangible assets

     as at december 31 2003 our consolidated balance sheet included
goodwill of 4219 million and other intangible assets of 1269 million

     our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization
expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur the
determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial
statements

     in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas 142 our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets
are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth
quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an asset might be impaired the annual evaluation is based on
valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash
flows and profitability projections in preparing the valuation models we
consider a number of factors including operating results business plans
economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market place
data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our
judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses the significant
estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales
growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and
discount rates our assessments to date have indicated that there has been
no impairment of these assets

     our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biopharma
capital spending as a result of aforementioned trends in this market drug
discovery experienced a doubledigit decline in revenue and profitability
during 2003 however the fair value of the companys drug discovery
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of 29 million as of september
30 2003 and december 31 2003 in accordance with the provisions of sfas
142 the company will monitor the fair value of this reporting unit closely
to determine if the 2004 business plan is being achieved for example we
will monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost
reduction programs are being realized including the program of
manufacturing site rationalization currently in progress

     should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
paragraphs not be accurate or should we incur lower than expected
operating performance or cash flows we may experience a triggering event
that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly
prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and
resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and
other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value

     our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite
lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives
change

income taxes

     income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect
managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items
reflected in the financial statements we record a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not
to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net
recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase
income equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made
likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or
part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made

     in 2002 and 2003 provisions were made for us income taxes on
certain undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as a decision was
made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them if
we decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in excess of
those originally planned we could be subject to additional income tax

     the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding
paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate
for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions if
any of our assumptions or estimates were to change or should our income
mix from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate can be
materially affected based on pretax income of 1369 million for the year
ended december 31 2003 each increase of 14 million in tax expense would
increase our effective tax rate by 1

revenue recognition

     revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any
significant customer obligations have been fulfilled standard shipping
terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly
title transfers upon shipment for those few countries where title cannot
legally transfer before delivery we defer revenue recognition until
delivery has occurred other than a few small software applications
mettlertoledo does not sell its software products without the related
hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument the
companys typical solution requires no significant production modification
or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the
functionality of the products revenues from service contracts are
recognized ratably over the contract period

warranty

     the company generally offers oneyear warranties on most of its
products product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized
for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected
by product failure rates material usage and service costs incurred in
correcting a product failure if we experience claims or significant cost
changes in material freight and vendor charges our cost of goods sold
could be affected

need for more and more sophisticated endofline inspection systems eg
for use in food processing and packaging and pharmaceutical and other
industries we are the worlds leading provider of metal detectors xray
visioning equipment and checkweighers metal detectors are most commonly
used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw
materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself
xraybased vision inspection helps detect nonmetallic contamination such
as glass stones and pits which come into the manufacturing process for
similar reasons both systems may be used together with checkweighers as
components of integrated packaging lines freeweighnet is our statistical
and quality control software that optimizes package filling monitors
weightrelated data and integrates it in real time into customers

through indirect channels a significant portion of our sales in the
americas is generated through the indirect channels we have a diversified
customer base as evidenced by the fact that our largest single customer
accounted for no more than 3 of 2002 net sales

sales and service

market organizations

     we have a host of geographically focused market organizations mos
around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
service the mos are local marketing and service organizations designed to
maintain close relationships with our customer base each mo has the
flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for
different cultural and economic conditions mos also work closely with our
producing organizations described below by providing feedback on
manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying innovative

research and development manufacturing

producing organizations

     our product development research and manufacturing efforts are
organized into a number of producing organizations pos pos are product
development teams comprised of personnel from our marketing development
research manufacturing engineering and purchasing departments our
focused pos help reduce product development time improve customer focus
reduce costs and maintain technological leadership the pos work together
to share ideas and best practices and there is a close interface among mos
and pos


research and development

     we attribute a significant portion of our recent margin improvement to
investments in our research and development efforts we intend to continue
to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically
advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications over
the last three years we have invested more than 191 million in research
and development 2002 706 million 2001 646 million 2000 563
million in 2002 we spent approximately 58 of net sales on research and
development our research and development efforts fall into two categories

     o    technology advancements which increase the value of our
          products these may be in the form of enhanced functionality new
          applications for our technologies more accurate or reliable
          measurement additional software capability or automation through
          robotics or other means and

     o    cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
          products through better overall design

     we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and
development budget to software development this includes software to
process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments
applicationspecific software and software that connects our solutions
into customers it systems we closely integrate research and development
with marketing manufacturing and product engineering we have over 800
employees in research and development and product engineering

manufacturing

     we generally manufacture only critical components ourselves usually
components that contain proprietary technology when outside manufacturing
is more efficient we contract with others for certain components we use a
wide range of suppliers we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate
and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability
of materials from time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our
requirements of a particular component supply arrangements for electronics
are generally made globally

     we are a worldwide manufacturer with facilities in the united states
switzerland germany the united kingdom and china laboratory instruments
are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united
states and china while our remaining products are produced worldwide we
emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations and most of our
products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications we use an
extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the
manufacturing process all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso
9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity is
sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs

backlog seasonality

     our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so
as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products
which helps to limit inventory costs backlog is therefore generally a
function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer
than one to two months

     our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal
variation particularly the highend laboratory instruments business
traditionally sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than and
sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second
and third quarters fourth quarter sales have historically generated
approximately 2728 of our sales this trend has a somewhat greater effect
on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread
evenly across all quarters

employees

     as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 8500 employees
throughout the world including approximately 4300 in europe 3000 in
north and south america and 1200 in asia and other countries we believe
our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material
employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years except for a
strike in early 2003 at our bethune france facility which is being
closed labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees

intellectual property

     we hold over 1700 patents and trademarks primarily in the united
states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and china
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological
innovations some of which are protected by patents and some of which are
not products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents
and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to
our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo
name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect
against infringement of our intellectual property

regulation

     our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals
by weights and measures regulatory authorities all of our electrical
components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe that we
are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations

     approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly
influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other
instruments in addition some of our products are used in legal for
trade applications in which prices based on weight are calculated and
for which specific weights and measures approvals are required although
there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets there
is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and
measures regulation is harmonized across the european union

     our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on
the enduser and market for example laboratory customers are typically
subject to good laboratory practices glp industrial customers to good
manufacturing practices gmp pharmaceutical customers to us food and
drug administration fda regulations and customers in food processing
industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point
haccp regulations products used in hazardous environments may also be
subject to special requirements

environmental matters

     we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in
the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a number of
properties and manufacturing facilities around the world like many of our
competitors we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and
operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and
regulations in both the united states and abroad

     we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect
to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in
both the united states and abroad our subsidiary highspeed checkweigher
is subject to an administrative consent order from the new jersey
department of environmental protection that provides for the remediation of
a former manufacturing site in landing new jersey under the terms of the
stock purchase agreement between gei international corporation and the
predecessor to hispeed gei assumed all responsibility for the
administrative consent order and to date has performed and paid for all
action it requires in addition certain of our present and former
facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over such
time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and
disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible
that such sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which
we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become the subject
of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have
not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental
matters it is possible that we could become subject to additional
environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

competition

     our markets are highly competitive weighing instruments markets are
fragmented both geographically and by application particularly the
industrial and food retailing weighing instruments markets as a result we
face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well
established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are
divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in
our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and
geographic markets

     we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their products and to introduce new products with
competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological
and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize
and maintain these advantages these advantages include our worldwide
market leadership positions our global brand and reputation our track
record of technological innovation our comprehensive highquality
solution offering our global sales and service offering our large
installed base of weighing instruments and the fact that our revenue base
is diversified by geographic region product range and customer to remain
competitive we must continue to invest in research and development sales
and marketing and customer service and support we cannot be sure that we
will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or
that we will be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any
competitive advantages

     we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets
for purchasing decisions are the product itself application support
service support and price in emerging markets where there is greater
demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor
than in developed markets competition in the united states laboratory
market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell
not only our products but those of our competitors as well

item 7  managements  discussion  and analysis of financial  condition and
         results of operations

     the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated
financial statements

overview

     we operate a global business with net sales that are diversified by
geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions
worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several
factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our
comprehensive solution offering the quality of our global sales and
service network our continued investment in product development our
pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on
opportunities in developed and emerging markets

     our financial information is presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us
gaap

     net sales in local currency increased 3 in 2002 7 in 2001 and 9
in 2000 the fluctuation of the us dollar versus our major trading
currencies increased us dollarreported sales growth in 2002 and reduced
us dollarreported sales growth in 2001 and 2000 net sales in us
dollars increased 6 in 2002 5 in 2001 and 3 in 2000 in 2002 we had
local currency sales growth of 16 in the americas and 10 in asia and
other markets partially offset by a decline of 10 in europe

     we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come
primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing
our customer base these include the need for increased efficiency for
example in accelerating time to market for new products achieving better
yields improving work processes and outsourcing noncore activities the
desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management
information systems the drive for ever higher quality of our customers
products and services including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory
and industry standards and the move towards globalization in all major
customer groups

     acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy our
acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network respected
brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we are
particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or
increase our solutions capability in addition we continue to focus on the
following end markets drug discovery process analytics food and drug
packaging and transportation and logistics

     we increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research
and development and selling general and administrative expenses before
amortization interest expense and nonrecurring costs as a percentage of
net sales from 130 in 2000 to 136 in 2002 or 144 on a constant
currency basis this improved performance was achieved while we continued
to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing
infrastructure we believe that a significant portion of the increase in
our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to reduce costs
reengineer our operations and focus on the highest valueadded segments of
the markets in which we compete we believe that adjusted operating income
provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our
operating performance on an ongoing basis and as such is used as an
important performance measurement by management adjusted operating income
is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should
not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our
performance

recent acquisitions

     we  have  completed  several  acquisitions  in  the  last  few  years
including the following

     in march 2002 we acquired softechnics inc based in texas usa
softechnics is a leading provider of instore retail item management
software solutions softechnics provides a key building block in our
solution offering to food retailers its software provides the full scope
of realtime item management thereby allowing retailers to match local
store inventory levels with local customer demand softechnics strongly
complements our leadership position in solutions for the management of
fresh goods in addition to gaining crossselling benefits we will be able
to offer an integrated data management solution in the future

     in november 2001 we acquired rainin instrument llc based in
california usa rainin is a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions
used in pharmaceutical biotech and medical research applications rainin
has a market leadership position in north america a truly differentiating
technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting
ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs this acquisition further
broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences
market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers assuming
we acquired rainin as of the beginning of 2001 the acquisition would have
added sales of approximately 65 million adjusted operating income of
approximately 20 million and diluted earnings per share of negative 001
on a pro forma basis

     in 2000 we acquired thornton inc based in massachusetts usa
thornton is the leader in pure and ultrapure industrial water monitoring
instrumentation used in semiconductor microelectronics pharmaceutical
and biotech applications we believe the acquisition of thornton is an
excellent strategic move to expand our process analytics business and gain
access to new markets its conductivity technology and knowhow are
complementary to our strength in ph and oxygen measurements with a broader
technology offering we will be better able to serve our expanded customer
base

     in 1998 we recorded charges for purchased research and development
for products that were being developed that had not established
technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and if
unsuccessful had no alternative future use in research and development
activities or otherwise these research and development projects related to
bohdan automation these purchased research and development projects have
been completed and there have been no material differences between actual
and projected results

cost reduction programs

     as further described in note 14 to our audited consolidated financial
statements in june 2002 the companys management approved restructuring
plans to exit manufacturing facilities in france and the united states and
reduce our expense structure as part of these efforts to reduce costs we
recorded a charge of 287 million 201 million after tax during the
year ended december 31 2002 the charge comprised involuntary employee
separation benefits writedowns of impaired assets to be disposed and
other exit costs we expect to involuntarily terminate approximately net
300 employees in targeted manufacturing and administrative areas and to
substantially complete the manufacturing consolidation by the end of 2003
these employees include positions primarily in manufacturing as well as
administrative and other personnel primarily at our principal us and
other western european operations as a result of these actions we expect
to eliminate approximately 15 million to 20 million of costs from the
business we estimate that approximately 4 million to 6 million of these
savings were realized in 2002 with a further 7 million to 8 million
expected in 2003 and the remainder in 2004

     in 2001 we recorded a charge of 152 million associated primarily
with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers this charge relates
primarily to severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting
facilities including lease termination costs and the writedown of
impaired assets in 2000 we recorded a charge of 14 million related to
the closedown and consolidation of operations

year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001

     net sales were 12137 million for the year ended december 31 2002
compared to 11480 million in the prior year this reflected an increase
of 3 in local currencies during 2002 results for 2002 were positively
impacted by the weakening of the us dollar against other currencies net
sales in us dollars during 2002 increased 6 we experienced a sharp
decline in sales of our european retail products in 2002 as a result of the
product conversions required in 2001 prior to the introduction of the euro
currency excluding the impact of european retail products in both 2002 and
2001 consolidated local currency sales growth would be 9 for the year
ended december 31 2002

     net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales
in europe decreased 10 in local currencies during 2002 versus the prior
year reflecting weak sales performance across several product lines
particularly in germany and france excluding the impact of european retail
products in both 2002 and 2001 european local currency sales decreased 1
for the year ended december 31 2002 net sales in local currencies during
2002 in the americas increased 16 principally due to the acquisition of
rainin instrument in november 2001 approximately 86 of rainins
operations are based in the americas with 7 each in asia and europe net
sales in asia and other markets increased 10 in local currencies during
2002 the results of our business in asia and other markets during 2002
reflect particularly strong sales performance in china

     as previously mentioned we acquired rainin instrument in november
2001 assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of 2001 the
acquisition would have added approximately 65 million of sales and 20
million of adjusted operating income to 2001 on a pro forma basis

     our sales decline in europe was primarily due to a decrease in sales
of our european retail products after the introduction of the euro
currency as well as a deterioration in economic conditions particularly
in germany and france in the americas there has been no sign to date of a
significant economic recovery benefiting the markets for most of our
products to the extent that economic conditions significantly deteriorate
in these or other parts of the world our sales growth and profitability
may be adversely affected

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 468 for 2002 and 461
for 2001 this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost
saving initiatives

     research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were
58 for 2002 compared to 56 for the prior year we continue to make
significant investments in research and development which increased 5 in
local currencies in 2002

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 274 for 2002 compared to 261 for the prior year
primarily due to changes in our sales mix and our reduced sales volume in
europe after adjusting for acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency
effects selling general and administrative expenses increased 2 in the
year ended december 31 2002

     adjusted operating income was 1652 million or 136 of net sales
for 2002 compared to 1651 million or 144 of net sales for the prior
year the reduced operating margin percentage is due to the combination of
two foreign exchange impacts first is the currency translation impact
resulting in higher reported us dollar sales due to weaker us dollar
exchange rates and second an unfavorable impact on pretax earnings of
approximately 43 million due primarily to the strengthening of the swiss
franc against the euro and us dollar adjusting for these items on a
constant currency basis would result in adjusted operating income of
approximately 144 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2002 our
2002 adjusted operating income increased 377 million in our principal
us operations due primarily to the rainin acquisition and improvements in
service profitability adjusted operating income declined significantly in
europe due to the aforementioned volume impact on european retail after the
introduction of the euro currency in 2001 in asia and other markets
adjusted operating income increased due to continued growth in china
partially offset by declines in other regions we believe that adjusted
operating income provides important financial information in measuring and
comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis and as such is
used as an important performance measurement by management adjusted
operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us
gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an
indicator of our performance

     interest expense remained at 172 million for 2002 as the reduced
interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings during 2002 to fund
the rainin acquisition

     other charges net were 282 million for 2002 compared to other
charges net of 154 million for the prior year the 2002 and 2001 amounts
include charges of 287 million 201 million after tax and 152
million 146 million after tax respectively primarily associated with
headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers

     our effective tax rate before nonrecurring items for the year ended
december 31 2002 was approximately 30 compared with 35 in 2001 this
reduction reflects the effects of a restructuring of our european
operations and other tax initiatives in addition we recorded a onetime
benefit of 231 million during the second quarter of 2002 related to the
completion of a tax restructuring program and related tax audits

     during the fourth quarter of 2002 we began a program of repatriating
foreign subsidiary earnings to the united states in a tax efficient manner
this program resulted in a repatriation of 85 million of foreign earnings
during 2002 in addition this program will result in the repatriation of
180 million of foreign earnings over the next few years the 2002
repatriation of 85 million created additional us taxable income
resulting in the utilization of certain historical tax attributes related
to our us operations and release of the related us federal deferred tax
valuation allowance the tax effects related to the future repatriation of
180 million were also accrued and included the establishment of other tax
attributes related to our us operations

     net earnings were 1004 million for the year ended december 31 2002
compared to net earnings of 723 million in the prior year excluding the
effect of the previously mentioned charge associated with headcount
reductions and manufacturing transfers and the onetime tax benefit net
earnings were 973 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this
compares to net earnings of 869 million in the prior year before the
prior year restructuring charge adjusting for the adoption of sfas 142
net earnings before restructuring charges and the onetime tax benefit for
the year ended december 31 2002 increased 4

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2000

     net sales were 11480 million for the year ended december 31 2001
compared to 10955 million in the prior year this reflected an increase
of 7 in local currencies during 2001 results for 2001 were negatively
impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies
net sales in us dollars during 2001 increased 5 we experienced a sharp
increase in sales of our european retail products as a result of the
product conversions required in 2001 prior to the introduction of the euro
currency excluding the impact of european retail products in both 2001 and
2000 consolidated local currency sales growth would be 4 for the year
ended december 31 2001

     net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales
in europe increased 10 in local currencies during 2001 versus the prior
year principally due to strong results in our retail product lines related
to the introduction of the euro currency excluding the impact of european
retail products in both 2001 and 2000 european local currency sales
increased 4 for the year ended december 31 2001 net sales in local
currencies during 2001 in the americas increased 1 net sales in asia and
other markets increased 18 in local currencies during 2001 the results of
our business in asia and other markets during 2001 reflect particularly
strong sales performance in china and japan net sales growth in the
americas was lower than europe and asia and other markets primarily due to
a deterioration in economic conditions

     as previously mentioned we acquired rainin instrument in november
2001 assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of 2000 the
acquisition would have added approximately 65 million of sales to both
2000 and 2001 on a pro forma basis in total acquisitions added
approximately 2 to 2001 sales growth

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 461 for 2001 and 452
for 2000 this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost
saving initiatives

     research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were
56 for 2001 compared to 51 for the prior year we continue to make
significant investments in research and development which increased 16 in
local currencies in 2001

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased to 261 for 2001 compared to 271 for the prior year in
part due to lower distribution costs associated with changes in our sales
mix

     adjusted operating income increased 16 to 1651 million or 144 of
net sales for 2001 compared to 1428 million or 130 of net sales for
the prior year our 2001 adjusted operating income increased significantly
in europe due to the favorable impact of the euro currency conversion but
was partially offset by a decline in the principal us operations in asia
and other markets adjusted operating income benefited from stronger sales
and improved manufacturing productivity in china we believe that adjusted
operating income provides important financial information in measuring and
comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis and as such is
used as an important performance measurement by management adjusted
operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us
gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an
indicator of our performance

     interest expense decreased to 172 million for 2001 compared to
200 million for the prior year the decrease was principally due to
reduced debt levels throughout the year

     other charges net were 154 million for 2001 compared to other
charges net of 26 million for the prior year the 2001 amount includes a
charge of 152 million 146 million after tax primarily associated with
headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers the 2000 amount includes
a charge of 14 million related to the closedown and consolidation of
operations

     our effective tax rate of 35 before nonrecurring items in 2001 was
consistent with the previous year

     net earnings were 723 million for the year ended december 31 2001
compared to net earnings of 701 million in the prior year excluding the
effect of the previously mentioned charge associated with headcount
reductions and manufacturing transfers net earnings were 869 million for
the year ended december 31 2002 this compares to net earnings of 715
million in the prior year before the prior year restructuring charge this
represents an increase in net earnings of 21

liquidity and capital resources

     liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments in addition
liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing therefore
liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that
consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving
longrange business objectives and meeting debt service commitments
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on
indebtedness working capital requirements capital expenditures and
acquisitions

     cash provided by operating activities totalled 1154 million in 2002
compared to 1016 million in 2001 and 847 million in 2000 the increase
in 2002 resulted principally from improved working capital management
included in 2002 cash provided by operating activities is an extra
contribution of 19 million to the us pension plan as a result we have
no significant required contributions to our us plan in the next two
years cash provided by operating activities includes payments for
restructuring certain acquisition integration activities and a onetime
payment in 2000 associated with an early retirement plan from previous
years these amounts totalled 111 million 107 million and 103
million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively excluding these amounts cash
provided by operating activities totalled 1267 million in 2002 compared
to 1123 million in 2001 and 950 million in 2000

     during 2002 we spent approximately 213 million on acquisitions
including additional consideration related to earnout periods associated
with acquisitions consummated in prior years the cash portions of these
purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional
borrowings we continue to explore potential acquisitions in connection
with any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in addition
the terms of certain of our acquisitions in 2002 and earlier years provide
for possible additional earnout payments although we do not currently
believe we will make any material payments relating to such earnouts the
maximum amount potentially payable in cash is 74 million including up to
30 million for rainin based on operating profits through march 31 2003

     capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made
primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of
facilities our capital expenditures totalled 332 million in 2002 332
million in 2001 and 293 million in 2000 capital expenditures in 2002
include spending of 83 million associated with rainins new facility in
california we also expect capital expenditures to increase between 2
million and 5 million in 2003 principally due to spending associated with
manufacturing transfers to china we expect capital expenditures to
increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates
change

     we expect the 2002 restructuring charge of 287 million to result in
cash outlays of approximately 202 million of which 103 million had
been incurred as of december 31 2002 and the remainder of which will be
substantially incurred during 2003

     at december 31 2002 our consolidated debt net of cash was 2812
million we had borrowings of 2921 million under our credit agreement and
206 million under various other arrangements as of december 31 2002 of
our credit agreement borrowings approximately 676 million was borrowed
as term loans scheduled to mature in may 2004 and 2245 million was
borrowed under a multicurrency revolving credit facility at december 31
2002 we had 1856 million of availability remaining under the revolving
credit facility

     at december 31 2002 approximately 1949 million of the borrowings
under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were
denominated in us dollars the balance of the borrowings under the credit
agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain
of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately 1178
million at december 31 2002 changes in exchange rates between the
currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our
borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we
borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to
changes in exchange rates

     under the credit agreement amounts outstanding under the term loans
are payable in quarterly installments in addition the credit agreement
obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with
the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness
and with certain excess cash flow the credit agreement imposes certain
restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions and
limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders incur
indebtedness make investments grant liens sell financial assets and
engage in certain other activities we must also comply with several
financial and other covenants including requirements that we maintain the
following criteria as specifically defined in our credit agreement

     o    a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda less capital
          expenditures to interest expense of 3251 at december 31
          2002 this ratio was more than 91

     o    a debt to ebitda ratio of no more than 41 at december 31 2002
          this ratio was less than 21 and

     o    a minimum net worth as specifically defined in the credit
          agreement of at least 300 million at december 31 2002 we
          exceeded the minimum by more than 3 times

     a deterioration in our financial performance could result in a breach
of these covenants and trigger the lenders right to require immediate
repayment of all or part of the indebtedness

     at december 31 2002 we are in compliance with all covenants set
forth in our credit facility and other indentures in addition we do not
have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our
debt

     the interest rates for our borrowings under the credit agreement are
based in part on our credit rating for so long as standard  poors
ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rates our
debt at bbb or above and moodys investors service inc rates our debt
at baa3 or above our current ratings the applicable interest rates are
determined from a grid that sets out the interest rates for each rating
grade however if our credit rating falls below bbb or baa3 then the
applicable interest rates are set by reference to a separate grid in which
interest rate levels are determined by our debt to ebitda ratio we
estimate that if our credit rating was reduced to below investment grade
our interest expense would increase by approximately 06 million per year

     we plan to implement a new credit agreement on or before the
expiration of the current facility in 2004

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december
31 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our
liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant
outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments during the
ordinary course of business we enter into contracts to purchase production
components for manufacture in general these commitments do not extend for
more than a few months

     statements

b  as described in note 15 to the audited consolidated financial
     statements





     we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities
together with liquidity available under the existing credit agreement or a
renegotiated agreement and local working capital facilities will be
sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital
spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for at least
several years but there can be no assurance that this will be the case

effect of currency on results of operations

     because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income
can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our
operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net
sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in
switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover
a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and
general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore
if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading
currencies eg the us dollar the euro other major european
currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also
have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss
franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european
currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also
decreases our operating profits during 2000 and prior years the swiss
franc and other european currencies have generally moved in a consistent
manner versus the us dollar therefore because the two effects
previously described have offset each other our operating profits were not
materially affected by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus
european currencies however as evidenced in 2002 and 2001 there can be
no assurance that these currencies will continue to move in a consistent
manner in the future in 2002 we estimate that the unfavorable impact due
primarily to the strengthening of the swiss franc was approximately 43
million we estimate that a one percent strengthening of the swiss franc
against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
08 million to 12 million on an annual basis in addition to the effects
of exchange rate movements on operating profits our debt levels can
fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us
dollar and the swiss franc

taxes

     we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of
factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions
the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions
the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions earnings
repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law generally the tax
liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a
nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined
basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same
jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of
nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we
may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall
basis we incur a net loss for the period

     our effective tax rate before nonrecurring items for the year ended
december 31 2002 was approximately 30 compared with 35 in 2001 this
reduction reflects the effects of a restructuring of our european
operations and other tax initiatives in addition we recorded a onetime
benefit of 231 million during the second quarter of 2002 related to the
completion of a tax restructuring program and related tax audits

environmental matters

     we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of
contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances

     we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with
environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad we
are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the
remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states
and abroad in addition some of these facilities have or had been in
operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and
disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the
future such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent
waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to
additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our
results of operations or financial condition

inflation

     inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use the
competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to
recover higher costs through increased selling prices moreover there may
be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the
major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products
which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed
to operations in china latin america and eastern europe which have
experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have
not had a material effect on our operating results however as our
presence in china latin america and eastern europe increases these
inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating
results



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and do not use them for trading purposes

     we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
economically hedge shortterm intercompany balances with our foreign
businesses such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and
unfavorable currency fluctuations a sensitivity analysis to changes in the
us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currencydenominated contracts
indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by 10
against all of our currency exposures the fair value of these instruments
would decrease by 29 million at december 31 2002 as compared with 53
million at december 31 2001 any resulting changes in fair value would be
offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the
sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange
rates the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may
overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as
described under effect of currency on results of operations

     we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to
limit our exposure to increases in interest rates these contracts are more
fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements
the market value of these contracts as at december 31 2002 and 2001 was
negative 44 million and negative 17 million respectively based on our
agreements outstanding at december 31 2002 a 100 basis point increase in
interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market
value of these instruments of 14 million as compared with 60 million
at december 31 2001 conversely a 100 basis point decrease in interest
rates would result in a 14 million net reduction in the net aggregate
market value of these instruments as compared with 60 million at
december 31 2001 any change in fair value would not affect our
consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the
variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled

     we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our
net investments a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on
such debt at december 31 2002 indicates that if the us dollar weakened
by 10 against the swiss franc the fair value of such debt would increase
by 73 million as compared with 38 million at december 31 2001 any
foreign exchange translation gains and losses arising from debt qualifying
as a nonderivative hedging instrument are recorded in comprehensive income
and offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange
translation gains and losses related to the hedged net investments

critical accounting policies

     managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing
basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts
inventories intangible assets revenue pensions and other postretirement
benefits income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions

     we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our
consolidated financial statements

 retirement plans pension and postretirement benefit plan expense and
obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations these
assumptions include discount rate and expected return on plan assets in
accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual
results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over
future periods while management believes the assumptions used are
appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
affect our plan obligations and future expense in 2002 we adjusted the
expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets to 85 down
from 95 and adjusted the discount rate used for all us pension and
postretirement plans to 70 from 75 in april 2002 we froze our us
pension plan and discontinued our us retiree medical program for certain
current and all future employees consequently no significant future
service costs will be incurred on these plans as a net result of these
changes consolidated recurring pension and postretirement expense in 2003
is expected to decrease by approximately 06 million in december 2002 we
made a 19 million payment to reduce the underfunded status of the us
pension plan however if the equity markets continue recent trends we
could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the
339 million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december 31
2002

 inventory we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand
and related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than
those projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be
required excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast
usage orders and technological obsolescence

 acquired intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in
goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future
period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will
incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated
financial statements

 income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items
reflected in the financial statements we record a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not
to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net
recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase
income in the period such determination was made likewise should we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net
deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset
would be charged to income in the period such determination was made in
2002 provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed
earnings of nonus subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate
these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them

 revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to a product has
transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled
other than a few small software applications mettlertoledo does not sell
its software products without the related hardware instrument as the
software is embedded in the instrument the companys typical solution
requires no significant production modification or customization of the
hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the
products revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the
contract period

new accounting standards

     in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 sfas 146
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit
or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no
943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and
other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a
restructuring the provisions of sfas 146 are effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002

item 1  business

overview

     mettlertoledo is a leading global supplier of precision instruments
we are the worlds largest manufacturer of weighing instruments for use in
laboratory industrial and food retailing applications we also hold
topthree market positions in several related analytical instruments and
are a leading provider of automated chemistry systems used in drug and
chemical compound discovery and development in addition we are the
worlds largest manufacturer and marketer of metal detection and other
endofline inspection systems used in production and packaging we also
derive a competitive advantage from our applicationoriented software
which processes the data captured by our instruments and integrates it into
customers information technology systems

     we focus on the high valueadded segments of our markets by providing
innovative instruments that are often integrated into applicationspecific
solutions for customers we design our instruments not only to capture
valuable data but also to facilitate the processing and transfer of this
data into customers management information systems

competitive strengths

     we believe our franchise has a number of competitive strengths which
allow us to compete successfully in high valueadded segments

o    worldwide market leadership positions we believe that we have a
     leading position in each of our markets and at least 80 of our
     product sales are from products that are the global leaders in their
     segment in the weighing instruments market we are the only company
     to offer products for laboratory industrial and food retailing
     applications globally and we believe that we hold a market share more
     than twice that of our nearest competitor we believe that in 2001 we
     had approximately 50 of the global market for laboratory balances
     including the largest market share in each of europe the united
     states and asia excluding japan and the number two position in
     japan in the industrial and food retailing markets we believe we
     have the largest market share in europe and the united states in
     asia we have a substantial industrial and food retailing business
     which has gained market share in recent years this business is
     supported by our established manufacturing presence in china in
     addition to our weighing franchise most of our other sales come from
     product lines where we hold a topthree global position

o    global brand and reputation the mettlertoledo brand name is
     identified worldwide with accuracy reliability and innovation
     customers value these characteristics because most of our instruments
     significantly impact customers product quality productivity costs
     and regulatory compliance furthermore precision instruments
     generally constitute a small percentage of customers aggregate
     expenditures as a result we believe customers focus on accuracy
     product reliability technical innovation service quality reputation
     and past experience when choosing precision instruments rather than
     cost alone we have one of the strongest brand names in the
     laboratory in fact laboratory balances are often generically referred
     to as mettlers the strength of this brand name has allowed us to
     successfully extend our laboratory balance line to include other
     analytical instruments

o    technological innovation we have a long and successful track record
     of innovation and remain at the forefront of technological development
     by focusing on the high valueadded segments of our markets we
     believe that we are the global leader in our industry in providing
     innovative measurement solutions to enhance our customers processes
     our technological innovation efforts benefit from our knowledge of
     customer processes and related requirements our manufacturing
     expertise in sensor technology precision machining and electronics
     as well as our strength in software development

o    comprehensive high quality solution offering we offer a more
     comprehensive range of instruments and solutions than any of our key
     competitors our broad product line addresses a wide range of
     applications across and within many industries and regions we
     manufacture our products in modern facilities most of which are iso
     9001 certified our broad range of high quality products and the
     ability to provide integrated solutions allows us to leverage our
     sales and service organization product development activities and
     manufacturing and distribution capabilities

o    global sales and service we have the only global sales and service
     organization among weighing instruments manufacturers and one of the
     largest of any precision instrument company we believe that this
     capability is a major competitive advantage at december 31 2001
     this organization consisted of more than 4200 employees organized
     into locally based customerfocused groups that provide prompt
     service and support to our customers and distributors in virtually all
     major markets around the world the local focus of our sales and
     service organization enables us to provide timely responsive support
     to our customers worldwide and provides feedback for manufacturing and
     product development when we survey our current and potential
     customers on their needs they often name service as the most
     important criteria for choosing their instrument suppliers in
     addition we believe there is a trend in many of our customer segments
     to outsource service activities which provides us a growth
     opportunity for the future

o    largest installed base we believe that we have the largest installed
     base of weighing instruments in the world from this installed base
     we obtain service contracts that provide a strong stable source of
     recurring service revenue service revenue represented approximately
     21 of net sales in 2001 of which almost half was derived solely from
     service contracts and repairs with the remainder derived from the sale
     of spare parts and software support we believe that our installed
     base of instruments represents a competitive advantage with respect to
     repeat purchases and purchases of other instruments we offer because
     customers tend to remain with their existing suppliers in addition
     switching to a new instrument supplier entails additional costs to the
     customer for training spare parts service and systems integration
     requirements close relationships and frequent contact with our broad
     customer base also provide us with sales leads and new product and
     application ideas

o    geographical product and customer diversification our revenue base
     is diversified by geographic region product range and customer many
     different industries including pharmaceuticals food processing food
     retailing and chemicals cosmetics and logistics utilize our broad
     product range we supply customers all over the world and our largest
     single customer accounted for no more than 3 of net sales in 2001
     our diverse revenue base reduces our exposure to regional or
     industryspecific economic conditions and our presence in many
     different geographic markets product markets and industries enhances
     our attractiveness as a supplier to multinational customers in 2001
     our sales were 1148 billion of this total 44 came from europe 43
     from north and south america and 13 from asia and other countries
     for additional information regarding our segment disclosure see note
     15 to our audited consolidated financial statements

growth strategies

     we believe that our growth opportunities arise from our solutions
approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base these
include the need for increased efficiency for example in accelerating
time to market achieving better yields improving work processes and
outsourcing noncore activities the desire to integrate information
captured by instruments into management information systems the drive for
ever higher quality products and services including the need to adhere to
stringent regulatory and industry standards and the move towards
globalization in all major customer groups

     we continue to execute the business strategies that we outlined at the
time of our buyout in 1996 which are described below the successful
implementation of these strategies has allowed us to achieve a compound
annual sales growth rate in local currencies of 10 since 1996 and to
improve our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and
development and selling general and administrative expenses before
amortization and nonrecurring costs from 578 million 68 of net
sales for 1996 to 1651 million 144 of net sales for 2001 earnings
per share increased from 014 in 1996 pro forma for our buyout to 202
in 2001 before nonrecurring items nonrecurring items in 2001 comprised a
146 million charge net of tax associated primarily with headcount
reductions and manufacturing transfers in addition our ratio of net debt
to ebitda decreased from 46 in 1996 to 18 in 2001 and our interest
coverage increased from 23 to 114 during the same period ebitda
represents adjusted operating income plus depreciation we believe that
adjusted operating income earnings per share before nonrecurring charges
and ebitda provide important financial information in measuring and
comparing our operating performance adjusted operating income earnings
per share before nonrecurring charges and ebitda are not intended to
represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as
alternatives to gaap earnings loss as a measure of financial performance
or to gaap cash flow as a measure of liquidity

     our key growth strategies are as follows

     expanding our technology leadership we attribute a significant
portion of our recent margin improvement to our research and development
efforts we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to
provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and
new applications over the last three years we have invested approximately
178 million in research and development and rd spending in local
currency has grown an average of 14 over this period while we expect rd
spending to generally grow faster than sales we do not expect it to
continue to grow at this rate of growth our research and development
efforts fall into two categories

     o  technology advancements which increase the value of our products
        these may be in the form of enhanced functionality new
        applications for our technologies more accurate or reliable
        measurement additional software capability or automation through
        robotics or other means and

     o  cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
        products through better overall design

     our research and development efforts have contributed to a pipeline of
innovative and new products significant reductions in product costs and
reduced time to market for our new products examples of recent product
introductions include

     o  the multimaxir performs realtime insitu ftir reaction monitoring
        and analysis directly in multiple vessels in a parallel synthesis
        system which enhances automated process rd by allowing chemists
        to analyze a wide range of organic chemistry

     o  optimizer being launched in 2002 a modular process development
        software platform which uses an array at lab reactor vessels for
        performing multiple chemical reactions simultaneously

     o  xmatepro a portable measuring instrument in our process analytics
        business which has interchangeable sensor modules that make it
        capable of measuring up to ten different parameters at programmable
        time intervals

     o  the unicorn family of products our secondgeneration pcbased
        network retail solution including weighing and labeling solutions
        for prepacking applications networked counter scales and
        perishable goods data management software these solutions are
        easily integrated into local networks and are designed for maximum
        flexibility and can be customized for countryspecific promotions
        unique user habits and differing preferences in data requirements

     o  the viper line of compact bench scales using monobloc technology
        which offer high resolution and accuracy for rugged industrial
        environments

     o  rondo 60 a configurable titrator that enables titration of up to
        60 samples without any user interaction featuring a built in
        keypad removable sample racks an automated rinsing system and an
        optical beakerrecognition system and its smaller sibling the
        rondolino for up to 9 samples

     o  the ax64004 comparator the first commercially available mass
        comparator with a continuous weighing range of up to 64 kg and a
        resolution of 01 mg and

     o  airweigh a highperformance checkweigher that weighs as many as
        900 packages per minute has an easytouse graphical user
        interface and stores individual product setups for fast and easy
        product changeover

     increasing our market share and capitalizing on opportunities in
developed markets we recognize that to be a successful company we must
not only develop excellent solutions but we must market and distribute
them effectively  more effectively than our competitors we view the key
elements of our sales and service strategy as follows

     o  we utilize what we believe are the most sophisticated marketing and
        sales techniques in our industry these techniques include the
        development and utilization of marketing databases we develop
        these databases to better understand the full potential of our
        market by customer location industry instrument and related
        application we then utilize this data to more efficiently direct
        our field resources and complement our direct and distributor sales
        forces with targeted mailing and telemarketing campaigns to more
        fully exploit our markets potential the transparency of the
        marketplace created through these databases allows us to more
        effectively identify penetration opportunities among customers and
        noncustomers we have seen this strategy take hold as evidenced by
        significant market share gains in certain targeted segments such as
        pharmaceutical and biotech

     o  with our developing ecommerce project we plan to create a
        configurable internet portal which will allow customers channel
        partners and suppliers to customize the information presented to
        them and to interact with us in the way they choose over time we
        will develop a knowledge base which will allow us to gain deeper
        insight into our customers patterns of behavior and give us better
        market transparency from this we will be able to refine our
        marketing efforts gain quicker market penetration with new
        products and services and ultimately reduce our marketing costs

     o  our service capabilities stretch across the globe and include
        aroundtheclock availability of welltrained technicians which is
        highly valued by our customers we believe that no other competitor
        has our capabilities and that our service capabilities are a
        critical success factor for us our valueadded services encompass
        maintenance calibration traceability of weights certification
        asset management software upgrades data integration and training
        service xxl which we recently expanded worldwide is a
        comprehensive suite of services covering regulatory compliance for
        design manufacture installation operation and maintenance of our
        customers instruments

     o  we also utilize a dual brand strategy for certain market segments
        to improve our overall market penetration for example we sell
        balances under the ohaus brand name as an alternative to the
        mettlertoledo brand name in certain distribution channels such as
        the education market

     capitalizing on opportunities in emerging markets we believe that
emerging markets will continue to provide growth opportunities for us
these growth opportunities are being driven primarily by economic
development and multinationals use of additional and more sophisticated
precision instruments as they shift production to emerging markets in
addition we believe that over the long term the trend toward
international quality standards the need to upgrade mechanical scales to
electronic versions and the establishment of local production facilities by
our multinational client base will add to the opportunities in emerging
markets

     to date our emerging market expansion has primarily focused on asia
and we grew by approximately 18 percent in that part of the world in 2001
in asia excluding japan we are the market leader in laboratory weighing
instruments and have a substantial industrial and food retailing business
that has gained market share in recent years for instance we have two
profitable operations in china a facility that manufactures and sells
industrial and food retailing products and a facility that manufactures and
distributes laboratory products we also have direct marketing
organizations in taiwan korea hong kong singapore india thailand
malaysia and eastern europe beyond asia we are also expanding our sales
and service presence in latin america and other emerging markets

     china represents a significant opportunity for us product
introductions and local market strength enabled our chinese businesses to
post another year of doubledigit sales growth in 2001 over the past two
years we have more than doubled the percentage of products we manufacture
in china we want to continue leveraging our chinese manufacturing and rd
as a platform for lowend products which are necessary to increase our
penetration of emerging markets at the same time we supply these products
to complementary channels in north america and europe for example in the
near future we plan to launch viking a global balance targeted for the
entrylevel user  one who is costconscious but who demands high quality
using the platform designed for this technology over the next 12 months
we will introduce a series of entrylevel balances with wideranging
resolutions to fully cover this market segment

     pursuing selected acquisition opportunities acquisitions are an
integral part of our growth strategy we believe that we have a powerful
acquisition platform in the instrument industry our acquisitions leverage
our global sales and service network respected brand extensive
distribution channels and technological leadership we are interested in
pursuing acquisitions which have strong strategic fit  for example
companies with complementary products that will benefit from our brand name
and global distribution channels and companies with solutions we can
combine with our own technologies to create overall better solutions for
our customers in addition our acquisitions should anchor more of our
business in fastergrowing markets we are particularly attracted to the
following end markets

     o  life sciences the impact of scientific developments including the
        human genome project is fundamentally changing the pharmaceutical
        industry and its need for automation in recent years we have
        acquired a variety of companies in the field of life sciences
        including bohdan asi berger and rainin we offer these companies
        the infrastructure to expand globally and take advantage of the
        mettlertoledo brand name rainin instrument is the leading
        manufacturer of pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical biotech
        and medical research applications a premier company with a strong
        growth rate and excellent operating margins rainin broadens our
        marketleading offering of instruments and solutions to the life
        sciences market

     o  process analytics our pharmaceutical and biotech customers need to
        comply with increasing quality standards at the same time they
        are seeking inline control instruments to improve their yields in
        december 2000 we acquired thornton a leader in pure and ultrapure
        industrial water monitoring instrumentation used in semiconductor
        microelectronics pharmaceutical and biotech applications their
        conductivity technology and knowhow are complementary to our
        strength in ph and oxygen measurements with a broader technology
        offering we are better able to serve our expanded customer base

     o  packaging control systems increasing safety and consumer
        protection requirements are driving the need for more and more
        sophisticated endofline inspection systems we are the worlds
        leading provider of metal detectors and checkweighers which when
        combined with our applicationspecific software packages provide
        food and drug packaging lines an integrated solution to check the
        quality and quantity of their packages in 2000 we acquired avs
        which allowed us to add xraybased vision technology to our
        offering

     o  transportation and logistics the effects of globalization the
        move to justintime processes and ecommerce are all causing our
        customers to invest in our weighing and dimensioning solutions our
        customers are the major express carriers freight forwarders
        thirdparty logistic entities and warehousing and distribution
        companies we are currently the leading supplier of automatic
        identification and data capture solutions which incorporate
        weighing and dimensioning technology to optimize the shipment and
        tracking of packages worldwide in 2000 we announced that we would
        acquire full ownership of our cargoscan subsidiary the premier
        provider of dimensioning technology

     these are not the only opportunities and end markets we are focusing
on we are also alert for opportunities to expand our solution scope
particularly by adding more applicationspecific software and to
consolidate fragmented markets or expand geographically finally once we
have made these acquisitions we will continue to invest in them in order
to realize and expand the value they offer

     reengineering and cost savings we have improved our profitability in
recent years partly through a series of initiatives aimed at reducing our
cost structure we plan to undertake similar initiatives in the future with
the goal of further improving our operating margins these initiatives
include

     o  continuing to leverage our chinese manufacturing and rd as a
        platform for lowend products which are necessary to increase our
        penetration of emerging markets we are also transferring
        production of many of our lowend products from europe and north
        america to china  the most recent example being our ohaus
        electronic laboratory balances and our shipping scales we now have
        almost 700 employees in china including approximately 110 rd
        professionals

     o  the first wave of our procurement initiative launched in 1999 has
        brought us substantial cost savings our global procurement
        initiative aims to reduce our supplier base to a select group of
        highquality suppliers from all parts of the world by doing so we
        believe we can ensure maximum cost effectiveness and improve the
        quality of our product and processes we are well into the second
        phase of this initiative and expect to continue to improve
        operating margins through a more effective procurement effort over
        the coming years

     o  opportunities in our service business we have approximately 2000
        employees worldwide engaged in service we have instituted a
        fourphase services costproductivity plan which we expect to
        enhance operating margin profit over its threeyear implementation
        by exploiting available technology and best practices

     o  we are taking advantage of the globalization of our customer base
        and the harmonization of regulatory standards worldwide to
        standardize our product lines on a global basis and streamline our
        organizational structure as much as possible we will harmonize
        our product lines worldwide with global standardized offerings
        our sales and service professionals will require less frequent
        training and reduced parts inventory rd resources will be
        redeployed for new valueadded products allowing us to gain
        incremental growth in addition consolidated operations will
        produce significant savings and more efficient use of invested
        capital

     we believe that these initiatives and others will place us in a
position to build on our recent improvement in profitability furthermore
we believe that we can leverage our existing infrastructure particularly
our recent investments in asia to obtain continued sales growth without
significant additions to our overall cost base

instruments and solutions

laboratory instruments

     laboratory balances the balance is the most common piece of equipment
in the laboratory we believe that we sell the highest performance
laboratory balances available on the market with weighing ranges from one
tenmillionth of a gram up to 32 kilograms our brand name is so well
recognized that laboratory balances are often generically referred to as
mettlers the mettlertoledo name is identified worldwide with accuracy
reliability and innovation in our judgment this reputation constitutes
one of our principal competitive strengths

     to meet our customer needs we seek to connect and integrate our

service

     we believe service capabilities are a critical success factor in our
business through our own dedicated service technicians we provide
contract and repair services in all countries in which our products are
sold this global service network also is an important factor in our
ability to expand in emerging markets we estimate that we have the largest
installed base of weighing instruments in the world and our contract and
repair services generate significant revenues in 2001 service
representing service contracts repairs software support and
replacement parts accounted for approximately 21 of our total net sales

     beyond revenue opportunities service is a key part of our product
offering and helps significantly in generating repeat sales the close

research and development manufacturing

producing organizations

     our product development research and manufacturing efforts are
organized into a number of producing organizations pos pos are product
development teams comprised of personnel from our marketing development
research manufacturing engineering and purchasing departments pos often
seek customer input to ensure that the products developed are tailored to
market needs we have organized our pos to reduce product development time
improve customer focus reduce costs and maintain technological leadership
the pos work together to share ideas and best practices and some employees
are in both mos and pos

research and development

     we attribute a significant portion of our recent margin improvement to
our research and development efforts we intend to continue to invest in
product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to
our customers for existing and new applications over the last three years
we have invested more than 178 million in research and development in
2001 we spent approximately 56 of net sales on research and development
our research and development efforts fall into two categories

     o  technology advancements which increase the value of our products
        these may be in the form of enhanced functionality new
        applications for our technologies more accurate or reliable
        measurement additional software capability or automation through
        robotics or other means and

     o  cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
        products through better overall design

     we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and
development budget to software development this includes
applicationspecific software as well as software utilized in sensor
mechanisms displays and other common components which can be leveraged
across our broad product lines

     we closely integrate research and development with marketing
manufacturing and product engineering we have over 750 professionals in
research and development and product engineering as part of our research
and development activities we have frequent contact with university
experts industry professionals and the governmental agencies responsible
for weights and measures analytical instruments and metal detectors in
addition our inhouse development is complemented by technology and
product development alliances with customers and original equipment
manufacturers

manufacturing

     we manufacture some of our own components usually components that
contain proprietary technology however when outside manufacturing is more
efficient we contract with others for certain components and in turn use
these components in our own manufacturing processes we use a wide range of
suppliers and we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate from time
to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a
particular component even then adequate alternative sources are generally
available if necessary supply arrangements for electronics are generally
made globally for mechanical components we generally use local sources to
optimize materials flow

     we strive to emphasize product quality in our manufacturing
operations and most of our products require very strict tolerances and
exact specifications we use an extensive quality control system that is
integrated into each step of the manufacturing process this integration
permits field service technicians to trace important information about the
manufacture of a particular unit which facilitates repair efforts and
permits finetuning of the manufacturing process many of our measuring
instruments are subjected to an extensive calibration process that allows
the software in the unit to automatically adjust for the impact of
temperature and humidity

     we are a worldwide manufacturer with manufacturing plants in the
united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france and china
laboratory products are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser
extent in the united states and china while industrial and food retailing
products are produced worldwide most of our manufacturing facilities have
achieved iso 9001 certification we believe that our manufacturing capacity
is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs

backlog

     manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to
permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products which
helps to limit inventory costs backlog is therefore generally a function
of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to
two months

employees

     as of december 31 2001 we had approximately 8500 employees
throughout the world including approximately 4400 in europe 2900 in
north and south america and 1200 in asia and other countries we believe
our employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material
employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years labor unions
do not represent a meaningful number of our employees

     in certain of our facilities we have a flexible workforce
environment in which hours vary depending on the workload this flexible
working environment enhances employees involvement thus increasing
productivity it also improves efficient payroll management by permitting
us to adjust staffing to match workload to a greater degree without
changing the size of the overall workforce

intellectual property

     we hold approximately 1500 patents and trademarks primarily in the
united states switzerland germany the united kingdom france japan and
china our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological
innovations some of which are protected by patents and some of which are
not products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents
and as a result no one patent or group of related patents is material to
our business we have numerous trademarks including the mettlertoledo
name and logo which are material to our business we regularly protect
against infringement of our intellectual property

regulation

     our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals
by weights and measures regulatory authorities although there are a large
number of regulatory agencies across our markets there is an increasing
trend toward harmonization of standards and weights and measures
regulation is harmonized across the european union our food processing and
food retailing products are subject to regulation and approvals by relevant
governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug
administration products used in hazardous environments may also be subject
to special requirements all of our electrical components are subject to
electrical safety standards we believe that we are in compliance in all
material respects with applicable regulations

environmental matters

     we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in
the jurisdictions in which we operate including provisions relating to air
emissions wastewater discharges the handling and disposal of solid and
hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the
use and disposal of hazardous substances we wholly or partly own lease or
hold a direct or indirect equity interest in a number of properties and
manufacturing facilities around the world including north and south
america europe australia and china like many of our competitors we have
incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures
and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the
united states and abroad

     we are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect
to the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in
both the united states and abroad in addition certain of our present and
former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and over
such time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is
possible that such sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties
to which we have sent wastes may in the future be identified and become
the subject of remediation accordingly although we believe that we are in
substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with
environmental matters it is possible that we could become subject to
additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations

     we or in some cases the former owner of toledo scale have been named
a potentially responsible party under cercla or analogous state statutes at
the following thirdparty owned sites with respect to the alleged disposal
at the sites by toledo scale during the period before we owned it
granville solvents site granville ohio aquatech environmental inc
site greer south carolina and seaboard chemical company site jamestown
north carolina pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement
between us and the former owner of toledo scale the former owner is
obligated to indemnify us for various environmental liabilities to date
with respect to each of the foregoing sites the former owner has
undertaken the defense and indemnification of toledo scale in addition
our subsidiary hispeed checkweigher is subject to an administrative
consent order aco from the new jersey department of environmental
protection that provides for the remediation of the former gei site in
landing new jersey however under the terms of the stock purchase
agreement between gei and hispeed gei assumed all responsibility for the
aco to date gei has performed and paid for the action required by the
aco based on currently available information and given our contractual
rights of indemnification we believe that the costs associated with the
investigation and remediation of these sites will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

competition

     our markets are highly competitive furthermore weighing instruments
markets are fragmented both geographically and by application particularly
the industrial and food retailing weighing instruments market as a result
we face numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are
well established in their markets in addition some of our competitors are
divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
resources than our own taken together the competitive forces present in
our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and
geographic markets

     we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their products and to introduce new products with
competitive prices although we believe that we have certain technological
and other advantages over our competitors we may not be able to realize
and maintain these advantages in any event to remain competitive we must
continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and
customer service and support we cannot be sure that we will have
sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will
be successful in identifying developing and maintaining any competitive
advantages

     we believe that the principal competitive factors in our us markets
for purchasing decisions are accuracy and durability while in europe
accuracy and service are the most important factors in emerging markets
where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a
more important factor than in developed markets competition in the united
states laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large
distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors
as well

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
         and results of operations

     the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements

overview

     we operate a global business with net sales that are diversified by
geographic region product range and customer we hold leading positions
worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several
factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation our
comprehensive solution offering the quality of our global sales and
service network our continued investment in product development our
pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on
opportunities in developed and emerging markets while all of our
businesses have significant strategic links in terms of technology or
customer base we have a geographically diverse business that serves
customers in relatively healthy and stable end markets including the
pharmaceutical biotech and food industries

     our financial information is presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us
gaap

     net sales in local currency increased 7 in 2001 9 in 2000 and 16
in 1999 the strengthening of the us dollar versus our major trading
currencies reduced us dollarreported sales growth in each year net
sales in us dollars increased 5 in 2001 3 in 2000 and 14 in 1999 in
2001 we had local currency sales growth of 10 in europe 1 in the
americas and 18 in asia and other markets

     we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come
primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing
our customer base these include the need for increased efficiency for
example in accelerating time to market for new products achieving better
yields improving work processes and outsourcing noncore activities the
desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management
information systems the drive for ever higher quality of our customers
products and services including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory
and industry standards and the move towards globalization in all major
customer groups

     acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy our
acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network respected
brand extensive distribution channels and technological leadership we are
particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or
increase our solutions capability for example software acquisitions in
addition we continue to focus on the following end markets drug
discovery process analytics food and drug packaging and transportation
and logistics

     we increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research
and development and selling general and administrative expenses before
amortization and nonrecurring costs as a percentage of net sales from
116 in 1999 to 144 in 2001 this improved performance was achieved
while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution
and manufacturing infrastructure we believe that a significant portion of
the increase in our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to
reduce costs reengineer our operations and focus on the highest
valueadded segments of the markets in which we compete we believe that
adjusted operating income provides important financial information in
measuring and comparing our operating performance adjusted operating
income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and
should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator
of our performance

recent acquisitions

     we have completed several acquisitions in the last few years
including the following

     in november 2001 we acquired rainin instrument llc based in
california usa rainin is the leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions
used in pharmaceutical biotech and medical research applications rainin
has a market leadership position in north america a truly differentiating
technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting
ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs this acquisition further
broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences
market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers assuming
we acquired rainin as of the beginning of 2001 the acquisition would have
added additional sales of approximately 65 million adjusted operating
income of approximately 20 million and diluted earnings per share of
negative 001 per share on a pro forma basis

     in 2000 we acquired thornton inc based in massachusetts usa
thornton is the leader in pure and ultrapure industrial water monitoring
instrumentation used in semiconductor microelectronics pharmaceutical
and biotech applications we believe the acquisition of thornton is an
excellent strategic move to expand our process analytics business and gain
access to new markets its conductivity technology and knowhow are
complementary to our strength in ph and oxygen measurements with a broader
technology offering we are better able to serve our expanded customer
base

     in 1999 we acquired the testutlutrana group a leading manufacturer
and marketer of industrial and retail weighing instruments in france with
annual sales of approximately 50 million we believe this acquisition is
an excellent strategic fit given testutlutranas extensive sales and
service network in france and excellent brand recognition by virtue of
this acquisition we assumed the leading position in food retail weighing
in europe and are well positioned to meet the rapidly changing demands of
our european customer base

     in 1999 we also signed an agreement to convert our 60 subsidiary in
changzhou china into a legal structure that provides us with full
control through this change in ownership we are able to fully leverage
this lowcost manufacturing base for international markets this move
underscores our strategic commitment to asia and our belief in the
fundamental growth factors for the region

     since the time of its buyout in 1996 the company has recorded
charges in 1996 1997 and 1998 for purchased research and development for
products that were being developed that had not established technological
feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and if unsuccessful had no
alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise
these research and development projects related to several projects at the
company at the time of its buyout safeline metal detection projects and
bohdan automation these purchased research and development projects have
been completed and there have been no material differences between actual
and projected results assumptions taken at the time of these acquisitions
continue to appear reasonable based upon actual results and in no cases
have there been significant shortfalls to the companys original
projections

cost reduction programs

     as further described in note 13 to our consolidated financial
statements as part of our efforts to reduce costs we recorded a charge in
2001 of 152 million associated primarily with headcount reductions and
manufacturing transfers in 2000 we recorded a charge of 14 million
related to the closedown and consolidation of operations in light of our
intention to continue to develop china as a lowcost manufacturing resource
and to seek other manufacturing costsaving opportunities we also recorded
a charge of 80 million in 1999 associated with the transfer of production
lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities
these charges relate primarily to severance and other related benefits and
costs of exiting facilities including lease termination costs and the
writedown of impaired assets and are expected to be completed during the
first quarter of 2002 during 1999 we also exited our glass batching
business based in belgium in this respect we incurred losses of 41
million during 1999 primarily for severance and other costs of exiting this
business we completed our exit of the glass batching business by the end
of 1999

     as part of our ongoing cost saving programs we have launched an
initiative to improve our procurement of materials and services the
initiative is intended to eliminate price differences between units
leverage potential opportunities to increase buying power and establish
worldwide sourcing arrangements we estimate that we are currently
receiving annualized savings of between 10 to 14 million from this
project

a  in connection with acquisitions in 1999 including the acquisition of
     the testutlutrana group we allocated 998 of the purchase price to
     revalue certain inventories principally workinprogress and finished
     goods to fair value net realizable value substantially all such
     inventories were sold during the second quarter of 1999

b  other charges net generally includes interest income foreign

     items the 2001 amount also includes a charge of 15196 related
     primarily to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers the
     2000 amount includes a charge of 1425 related to the closedown and
     consolidation of operations the 1999 amount includes a gain on an
     asset sale of approximately 3100 a charge of 8007 to transfer
     production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2000

     net sales were 11480 million for the year ended december 31 2001
compared to 10955 million in the prior year this reflected an increase
of 7 in local currencies during 2001 results for 2001 were negatively
impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies
net sales in us dollars during 2001 increased 5

     net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales
in europe increased 10 in local currencies during 2001 versus the prior
year principally due to strong results in our retail product lines related
to the introduction of the euro currency offset in part by a weakening in
our industrial product lines during the second half of the year net sales
in local currencies during 2001 in the americas increased 1 net sales in
asia and other markets increased 18 in local currencies during 2001 the
results of our business in asia and other markets during 2001 reflect
particularly strong sales performance in china and japan

     net sales growth in the americas was lower than europe and asia and
other markets primarily due to a deterioration in economic conditions to
the extent that economic conditions significantly deteriorate in the
americas or other parts of the world our sales growth and profitability
may be adversely affected

     as previously mentioned we acquired rainin instrument in november
2001 assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of 2000 the
acquisition would have added approximately 65 million of sales to both
2000 and 2001 on a pro forma basis in total acquisitions added
approximately 2 to 2001 sales growth

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 461 for 2001 and 452
for 2000 this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost
saving initiatives

     research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were
56 for 2001 compared to 51 for the prior year we continue to make
significant investments in research and development which increased 16 in
local currencies in 2001

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased to 261 for 2001 compared to 271 for the prior year in
part due to lower distribution costs associated with changes in our sales
mix

     adjusted operating income increased 16 to 1651 million or 144 of
net sales for 2001 compared to 1428 million or 130 of net sales for
the prior year the increased operating profit reflected the benefits of
higher sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity we
believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial
information in measuring and comparing our operating performance adjusted
operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us
gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an
indicator of our performance

     interest expense decreased to 172 million for 2001 compared to
200 million for the prior year the decrease was principally due to
reduced debt levels throughout the year

     other charges net were 154 million for 2001 compared to other
charges net of 26 million for the prior year the 2001 amount includes a
charge of 152 million 146 million after tax primarily associated with
headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers the 2000 amount includes
a charge of 14 million related to the closedown and consolidation of
operations

     our effective tax rate of 35 before nonrecurring items in 2001 was
consistent with the previous year

     net earnings were 869 million in 2001 compared to 715 million in
2000 before the previously mentioned charges associated with headcount
reductions and manufacturing transfers of 146 million in 2001 and 14
million in 2000 this represents an increase in net earnings of 21

year ended december 31 2000 compared to year ended december 31 1999

     net sales were 10955 million for the year ended december 31 2000
compared to 10655 million in the prior year this reflected an increase
of 9 in local currencies during 2000 results for 2000 were negatively
impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies
net sales in us dollars during 2000 increased 3

     net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales
in europe increased 11 in local currencies during 2000 versus the prior
year the increase reflected organic growth in our business and the effect
of the testutlutrana acquisition net sales in local currencies during
2000 in the americas increased 6 net sales in asia and other markets
increased 13 in local currencies during 2000 the results of our business
in asia and other markets during 2000 reflect strong sales performance in
china and japan

     the operating results for testutlutrana which were included in our
results from may 1 1999 would have had the effect of increasing our net
sales by an additional 163 million in 1999

     gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 452 for 2000 and 1999
before nonrecurring acquisition costs in 1999 during 2000 we experienced
an increase in certain raw material costs including electronics

     research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were
51 for 2000 compared to 54 for the prior year this decrease is the
result of exchange rate movements

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased to 271 for 2000 compared to 282 for the prior year

     adjusted operating income increased 15 to 1428 million or 130 of
net sales for 2000 compared to 1237 million or 116 of net sales for
the prior year the 1999 period excludes the previously noted nonrecurring
acquisition charge of 10 million for the revaluation of inventories to
fair value the increased operating profit reflected the benefits of higher
sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity we believe
that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in
measuring and comparing our operating performance adjusted operating
income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and
should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator
of our performance

     interest expense decreased to 200 million for 2000 compared to
220 million for the prior year the decrease was principally due to
reduced debt levels

     other charges net were 26 million for 2000 compared to other
charges net of 105 million for the prior year the 2000 amount includes
a charge of 14 million related to the closedown and consolidation of
operations the 1999 amount also included a gain on an asset sale of 31
million charges of 80 million regarding the transfer of production lines
from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities losses
of 41 million to exit our glass batching business based in belgium and a
charge of 08 million relating to the secondary offering completed in
1999

     our effective tax rate of 35 before nonrecurring items in 2000 was
consistent with the previous year

     net earnings were 715 million in 2000 compared to 579 million in
1999 before the 14 million charge to close down and consolidate
operations in 2000 and expenses for the secondary offering acquisition
charges and the 80 million charge to transfer production lines from the
americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities in 1999 this
represents an increase of 23

liquidity and capital resources

     cash provided by operating activities totalled 1016 million in 2001
compared to 847 million in 2000 and 913 million in 1999 the increase
in 2001 resulted principally from increased adjusted operating income and
improved working capital management the decrease in 2000 from 1999
resulted principally from a onetime payment of 42 million associated
with an early retirement plan from previous years as well as an increase
in inventory levels associated with product introductions production
transfers and increased safety stocks of electronics in 1999 we also
increased our accounts payable terms with many suppliers to improve our
working capital efficiency this resulted in an increase in cash provided
by operating activities of 162 million in 1999 we maintained these
payment terms in 2000 and therefore accounts payables were not a source
of cash in 2000 cash provided by operating activities includes payments
for restructuring certain acquisition integration activities and a
onetime payment in 2000 associated with an early retirement plan from
previous years these amounts totalled 107 million 103 million and
59 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively excluding these amounts
cash provided by operating activities totalled 1123 million in 2001
compared to 950 million in 2000 and 972 million in 1999

     during 2001 we spent approximately 3098 million on acquisitions
including the issuance of shares of 1443 million and additional
consideration related to earnout periods associated with acquisitions
consummated in prior years the cash portion of these purchases were funded
from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings we continue
to explore potential acquisitions in connection with any acquisition we
may incur additional indebtedness in addition we may make additional
earnout payments relating to certain of these and previous year
acquisitions in the future including up to 60 million for rainin up to
half of any additional contingent payment for rainin may be paid in shares
of our common stock and the remainder will be paid in cash

     capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made
primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of
facilities our capital expenditures totalled 332 million in 2001 293
million in 2000 and 292 million in 1999 we expect capital expenditures
to increase as our business grows and fluctuate as currency exchange rates
change we also expect capital expenditures to increase between 5 to 10
million in 2002 principally due to spending associated with rainins new
facility in california usa

     at december 31 2001 our consolidated debt net of cash was 3320
million we had borrowings of 3328 million under our credit agreement and
269 million under various other arrangements as of december 31 2001 of
our credit agreement borrowings approximately 944 million was borrowed
as term loans scheduled to mature in 2004 and 2384 million was borrowed
under a multicurrency revolving credit facility at december 31 2001 we
had 1622 million of availability remaining under the revolving credit
facility

     at december 31 2001 approximately 2785 million of the borrowings
under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were
denominated in us dollars the balance of the borrowings under the credit
agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain
of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately 812
million at december 31 2001 changes in exchange rates between the
currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our
borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity in addition because we
borrow in a variety of currencies our debt balances fluctuate due to
changes in exchange rates

     under the credit agreement amounts outstanding under the term loans
are payable in quarterly installments in addition the credit agreement
obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with
the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness
and with certain excess cash flow the credit agreement imposes certain
restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions and
limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders incur
indebtedness make investments grant liens sell financial assets and
engage in certain other activities we must also comply with several
financial and other covenants including requirements that we maintain the
following criteria as specifically defined in our credit agreement

     o    a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda less capital
          expenditures to interest expense of 3251 at december 31
          2001 this ratio was more than 851

     o    a debt to ebitda ratio of no more than 41 at december 31 2001
          this ratio was less than 21 and

     o    a minimum net worth as specifically defined in the credit
          agreement of at least 300 million at december 31 2001 we
          exceeded the minimum by more than 25 times

     a deterioration in our financial performance could result in a breach
of these covenants and trigger the lenders right to require immediate
repayment of all or part of the indebtedness

     however at december 31 2001 the company is in compliance with all
covenants set forth in its credit facility and other indentures in
addition the company does not have any downgrade triggers that would
accelerate the maturity dates of its debt

     the interest rates for our borrowings under the credit agreement are
based in part on our credit rating for so long as standard  poors
ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rates our
debt at bbb or above and moodys investors service inc rates our debt
at baa3 or above the applicable interest rates are determined from a
grid that sets out the interest rates for each rating grade however if
our credit rating falls below bbb or baa3 then the applicable interest
rates are set by reference to a separate grid in which interest rate levels
are determined by our debt to ebitda ratio we estimate that if our credit
rating was reduced to below investment grade our interest expense would
increase by approximately 07 million per year

     the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at
december 31 2001 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on
our liquidity and cash flow in future periods we do not have significant
outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments during the
ordinary course of business we enter into contracts to purchase raw
materials and components for manufacture in general these commitments do
not extend for more than a few months

     a as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

     b as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

     we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities
together with borrowings available under the credit agreement and local
working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund currently
anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements as well
as debt service requirements for at least several years but there can be
no assurance that this will be the case

effect of currency on results of operations

     because we conduct operations in many countries our operating income
can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
swiss francdenominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our
operating expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net
sales in part this is because most of our manufacturing costs in
switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland moreover
a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and
general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland therefore
if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading
currencies eg the us dollar the euro other major european
currencies and the japanese yen our operating profit is reduced we also
have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss
franc than we have expenses in those currencies therefore when european
currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc it also
decreases our operating profits in recent years the swiss franc and other
european currencies have generally moved in a consistent manner versus the
us dollar therefore because the two effects previously described have
offset each other our operating profits have not been materially affected
by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus european currencies
however there can be no assurance that these currencies will continue to
move in a consistent manner in the future we estimate that a one percent
strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a
decrease in our earnings before tax of 08 million to 12 million on an
annual basis in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on
operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange
rates particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc

taxes

     we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of
factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions
the tax rates in such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions
the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate
income and changes in law generally the tax liability for each taxpayer
within the group is determined either i on a
nonconsolidatednoncombined basis or ii on a consolidatedcombined
basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same
jurisdiction in either case without regard to the taxable losses of
nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we
may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall
basis we incur a net loss for the period

environmental matters

     we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
including those relating to air emissions wastewater discharges the
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of
contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances

     we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with
environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad we
are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the
remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states
and abroad in addition some of these facilities have or had been in
operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and
disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the
future such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent
waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
remediation accordingly it is possible that we could become subject to
additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our
results of operations or financial condition

inflation

     inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use the
competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to
recover higher costs through increased selling prices moreover there may
be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the
major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products
which may limit our ability to recover increased costs we remain committed
to operations in china latin america and eastern europe which have
experienced inflationary conditions to date inflationary conditions have
not had a material effect on our operating results however if our
presence in china latin america and eastern europe increases these
inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating
results



page


seasonality

     our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal
variation with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than and sales
in the fourth quarter slightly higher than sales in the second and third
quarters this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from
operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across
all quarters



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and do not use them for trading purposes

     we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
shortterm intercompany balances with our foreign businesses such
contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency
fluctuations a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and
swiss franc on these foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that
if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by 10 against all of
our currency exposures the fair value of these instruments would decrease
by 53 million at december 31 2001 as compared with 12 million at
december 31 2000 any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by
changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position the sensitivity
analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates the
assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the
impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in
a foreign currency we also have other currency risks as described under
effect of currency on results of operations

     we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to
limit our exposure to increases in interest rates these contracts are more
fully described in note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements
based on our agreements outstanding at december 31 2001 a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate
market value of these instruments of 60 million as compared with 08
million at december 31 2000 conversely a 100 basis point decrease in
interest rates would result in a 60 million net reduction in the net
aggregate market value of these instruments as compared with 07 million
at december 31 2000 any change in fair value would not affect our
consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the
variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled

     we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our
net investments a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on
such debt at december 31 2001 indicates that if the us dollar weakened
by 10 against the swiss franc the fair value of such debt would increase
by 38 million as compared with 97 million at december 31 2000 any
changes in fair value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive income and
offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange changes on
the net investments they hedge

critical accounting policies

     managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we
evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories
intangible assets pensions and other postretirement benefits income
taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

     we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 in our
consolidated financial statements

 accounts receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments
additional allowances may be required

 inventory we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market the
estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and
related pricing if actual market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management reductions in the value of inventory may be
required

 acquired intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in
goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future
period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will
incur the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated
financial statements

 deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net
recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase
income in the period such determination was made likewise should we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net
deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset
would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

new accounting standards

     in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued
statements of financial accounting standards no 141 sfas 141
business combinations and no 142 sfas 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets sfas 141 prospectively prohibits the pooling of
interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after
june 30 2001 and also provides new criteria for recognizing acquired
intangible assets separately from goodwill sfas 142 effective for fiscal
years beginning after december 15 2001 requires that goodwill no longer
be amortized to earnings but instead be reviewed for impairment under sfas
142 upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going
forward in addition any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed
after june 30 2001 is not amortized we estimate the adoption of these
statements will increase our net earnings by 65 million and our diluted
earnings per share by 015 per share on an annual basis or 014 per
share adjusting for additional shares issued in connection with our
acquisition of rainin we estimate the adoption of these statements would
have had the following effects on our quarterly financial results for the
year ended december 31 2001

     sfas 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment
using a twostep process the first step is to identify a potential
impairment and in transition this step must be measured as of the
beginning of the fiscal year however a company has six months from the
date of adoption to complete the first step we expect to complete that
first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of
2002 the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount
of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of
adoption if any and must be completed by the end of the companys fiscal
year intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested
for impairment using a onestep process which compares the fair value to
the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year
and pursuant to the requirements of sfas 142 will be completed during the
first quarter of 2002 any impairment loss resulting from the transitional
impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the first quarter 2002 we have not yet determined
what effect these impairment tests will have on our earnings and financial
position

     in october 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting
standards no 144 accounting for impairment or disposal of longlived
assets sfas 144 sfas 144 supersedes statement of financial accounting
standards no 121 accounting for impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of sfas 121 and amends accounting
principles bulletin opinion no 30 reporting results of operations 
reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business sfas 144
develops one accounting model for longlived assets that are disposed of by
sales based on the model previously developed in sfas 121 this statement
also makes changes to the manner in which amounts from discontinued
operations are measured and expands the scope of the components of an
entity that qualify for discontinued operations treatment this statement
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2001 we have
not fully evaluated the impact of adopting this statement on our
consolidated financial statements

periods

12           taxes  continued

     the company has recorded valuation allowances related to its deferred
income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of
future benefits from such assets the 2001 net change in the valuation
allowance is primarily attributable to the changes as enumerated above that
are related to the increased uncertainty of the realization potential
andor increases in associated deferred tax assets

     the potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
near term is dependent on the future realizability of the deferred tax
assets that are affected by the future profitability of operations in
various worldwide jurisdictions but primarily in the united states a
valuation allowance has been provided on the companys net deferred tax
assets related to its united states operations because of the uncertainty
regarding their realizability due to the expectation that deductions from
future employee stock option exercises and related tax deductions will
exceed future taxable income deferred tax assets of 193 million at
december 31 2001 pertain to net operating loss carryforwards resulting
from the exercise of certain employee stock options when recognized the
tax benefit of these losses will be recorded in shareholders equity

     the total valuation allowances relating to acquired businesses amount
to 143 million and 155 million at december 31 2001 and 2000
respectively the reduction for the current year is primarily attributable
to the utilization of net operating losses and the expiration of the useful
life of various deferred tax assets future reductions of these valuation
allowances will continue to be credited to goodwill when realized

     at december 31 2001 for us federal income tax purposes the
company had net operating loss carryforwards of 626 million that expire
in various amounts through 2021 and other tax credits of 04 million that
have no expiration the company has various us state net operating losses
and various foreign operating losses that expire in varying amounts through
2021

     the company is currently under examination in various taxing
jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations while the company
has not yet received any material assessments from these taxing
authorities the company believes that adequate amounts of taxes and
related interest and penalties have been provided for any adverse
adjustments as a result of these examinations and that the ultimate outcome
of these examinations will not result in an adverse material impact on the
companys consolidated results of operations or financial position

         we focus on the high  valueadded  segments of our markets by providing
innovative  instruments  that are  often  integrated  into  applicationspecific
solutions for customers  we design our instruments not only to capture valuable
data but also to  facilitate  the  processing  and  transfer  of this  data into
customers management information systems

competitive strengths

         we believe our franchise has a number of competitive  strengths  which
allow us to compete successfully in high valueadded segments

o        worldwide market  leadership positions   we believe  that  we  have  a
         leading  position  in each of our  markets  and  at  least  80 of our
         product sales are from  products  that are the global  leaders in their
         segment in the weighing instruments market we are the only company to
         offer   products  for   laboratory   industrial   and  food  retailing
         applications  globally  and we believe that we hold a market share more
         than twice that of our nearest  competitor  we believe that in 2000 we
         had  approximately  50 of the global market for  laboratory  balances
         including the largest market share in each of europe the united states
         and asia  excluding  japan  and the number two position in japan in
         the  industrial  and food  retailing  markets  we  believe we have the
         largest market share in europe and the united states  in asia we have
         a substantial  industrial and food retailing  business which has gained
         market  share in  recent  years  this  business  is  supported  by our
         established  manufacturing  presence  in  china  in  addition  to  our
         weighing  franchise  most of our other sales come from  product  lines
         where we hold a topthree global position

o        global  brand  and  reputation   the  mettlertoledo   brand  name  is
         identified   worldwide  with  accuracy   reliability  and  innovation
         customers value these  characteristics  because most of our instruments
         significantly  impact customers product quality  productivity  costs
         and regulatory compliance furthermore precision instruments generally
         constitute a small percentage of customers aggregate expenditures  as
         a result we believe customers focus on accuracy  product reliability
         technical innovation  service quality  reputation and past experience
         when choosing  precision  instruments  rather than cost alone we have
         one of the strongest brand names in the laboratory  in fact laboratory
         balances are often generically referred to as mettlers  the strength
         of this brand name has allowed us to successfully extend our laboratory
         balance line to include other analytical instruments

o        technological innovation we have a long and successful track record of
         innovation and remain at the forefront of technological  development by
         focusing on the high valueadded  segments of our markets  we believe
         that we are the global leader in  our industry in providing  innovative
         measurement  solutions  to   enhance  our  customers  processes   our
         technological   innovation  efforts   benefit  from  our  knowledge  of
         customer  processes  and   related   requirements   our  manufacturing
         expertise in sensor technology  precision   machining and electronics
         as well as our strength in software development

o        comprehensive   high  quality  solution  offering  we  offer  a  more
         comprehensive  range of  instruments  and solutions than any of our key
         competitors   our  broad  product  line  addresses  a  wide  range  of
         applications   across  and  within  many  industries  and  regions  we
         manufacture  our products in modern  facilities  most of which are iso
         9001  certified  our  broad  range of high  quality  products  and the
         ability to provide integrated solutions


                                       2
page

         allows  us to  leverage  our sales and  service  organization  product
         development activities and manufacturing and distribution capabilities

o        global  sales and  service  we have the only global  sales and service
         organization among weighing instruments  manufacturers  and one of the
         largest of any  precision  instrument  company  we  believe  that this
         capability is a major competitive advantage at december 31 2000 this
         organization  consisted  of more than 4000  employees  organized  into
         locally based  customerfocused groups that provide prompt service and
         support  to our  customers  and  distributors  in  virtually  all major
         markets  around the  world  the local  focus of our sales and  service
         organization  enables us to provide timely  responsive  support to our
         customers worldwide and provides feedback for manufacturing and product
         development  when we survey our current  and  potential  customers  on
         their needs they often name service as the most important criteria for
         choosing their instrument suppliers in addition we believe there is a
         trend in may of our customer segments to outsource service  activities
         which provides us a growth opportunity for the future

o        largest  installed base we believe that we have the largest  installed
         base of weighing instruments in the world from this installed base we
         obtain  service  contracts  that  provide  a strong  stable  source of
         recurring service revenue  service revenue  represented  approximately
         18 of net  sales in  2000  of which  approximately  half was  derived
         solely from service  contracts and repairs with the  remainder  derived
         from the sale of spare  parts  we believe that our  installed  base of
         instruments  represents a competitive  advantage with respect to repeat
         purchases  and  purchases  of  other  instruments  we  offer   because
         customers  tend to remain with their existing  suppliers  in addition
         switching to a new instrument  supplier entails additional costs to the
         customer for  training  spare parts  service and systems  integration
         requirements  close  relationships and frequent contact with our broad
         customer  base also  provide us with sales  leads and new  product  and
         application ideas

o        geographical product and customer diversification our revenue base is
         diversified  by geographic  region  product  range and customer  many
         different industries including pharmaceuticals  food processing food
         retailing and  chemicals  cosmetics  and  logistics  utilize our broad
         product  range  we supply  customers  all over the  world  and no one
         customer  accounted for more than 3 of net sales in 2000  our diverse
         revenue  base  reduces our  exposure  to regional or  industryspecific
         economic  conditions  and our  presence in many  different  geographic
         markets  product markets and industries enhances our attractiveness as
         a supplier to  multinational  customers  in 2000  our sales were 11
         billion  of this total 44 came from europe  44 from north and south
         america  and  12  from  asia  and  other  countries   for  additional
         information  regarding  our  segment  disclosure  see  note  15 to our
         audited consolidated financial statements

growth strategies

         we believe  that our  growth  opportunities  arise  from our  solutions
approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base these include the
need for increased  efficiency  for example  in  accelerating  time to market
achieving  better  yields  improving work  processes and  outsourcing  noncore
activities  the desire to integrate  information  captured by instruments into
management  information  systems the drive for ever higher quality products and
services  including  the need to adhere to  stringent  regulatory  and industry
standards and the move towards globalization in all major customer groups

         we continue to execute the business  strategies that we outlined at the
time  of our  buyout  in  1996  which  are  described  below  the  successful
implementation  of these  strategies has allowed us to achieve a compound annual
sales  growth rate in local  currencies  of 11 since  1996  and to improve our
adjusted  operating  income  gross  profit less  research and  development  and
selling   general  and   administrative   expenses  before   amortization   and
nonrecurring  costs from 578  million 68 of net sales for 1996 to 1428
million 130 of net sales for 2000  earnings per share  increased from 014
in 1996 pro forma for our buyout to 170 in 2000 before nonrecurring items
in addition  our ratio of net debt to ebitda  decreased from 46 in 1996 to 16
in 2000 and our  interest  coverage  increased  from 23 to 84  during the same
period

         our key growth strategies are as follows

         expanding our technology leadership we attribute a significant portion
of our recent margin  improvement to our research and  development  efforts  we
intend  to  continue  to  invest  in  product  innovation  in order  to  provide
technologically  advanced  products  to  our  customers  for  existing  and  new
applications  over the last three years  we have invested  approximately  160
million in research and development  our research and development  efforts fall
into two categories

         o    technology advancements which increase the value of our products
              these  may  be  in  the  form  of  enhanced   functionality   new
              applications  for our  technologies  more  accurate  or  reliable
              measurement  additional software capability or automation through
              robotics or other means

         o    cost reductions which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
              products through better overall design

         our research and development  efforts have contributed to a pipeline of
innovative and new products significant reductions in product costs and reduced
time to market for our new products  examples of recent  product  introductions
include

         o    our new ax line of analytical  balances  which gives scientists a
              wealth of new capabilities through its embedded software internet
              connection for remote  monitoring and  downloadable  applications
              and sensors that provide for singlehanded operation

         o    our internetenabled  industrial terminal  jagxtreme which gives
              production   managers  the  ability  to  perform   monitoring  and
              diagnostics  offsite  including  predicting  equipment  problems
              before they disrupt manufacturing processes and

                                       4

         o    multimax our highthroughput lab reactor which combines multiple
              vessels with robotic and ftir technologies that enable chemists to
              reduce  process  development  time by running  realtime  chemical
              analysis

         increasing  our  market  share and  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in
developed  markets  we recognize that to be a successful  company  we must not
only  develop  excellent  solutions  but we must  market  and  distribute  them
effectivelymore  effectively than our competitors we view the key elements of
our sales and service strategy as follows

         o    we utilize what we believe are the  most  sophisticated  marketing
              and sales techniques in our industry these techniques include the
              development  and  utilization of marketing  databases  we develop
              these  databases to better  understand  the full  potential of our
              market by customer  location  industry  instrument  and related
              application  we then utilize this data to more efficiently direct
              our field  resources  and  complement  our direct and  distributor
              sales forces with targeted mailing and telemarketing  campaigns to
              more fully exploit our markets potential the transparency of the
              marketplace  created  through  these  databases  allows us to more
              effectively identify penetration opportunities among customers and
              noncustomers

         o    with  our  developing   ecommerce project  we  plan  to create a
              configurable  internet portal which will allow customers  channel
              partners and suppliers to customize the  information  presented to
              them and to interact with us in the way they choose over time we
              will  develop a knowledge  base which will allow us to gain deeper
              insight  into our  customers  patterns  of  behavior  and give us
              better market  transparency  from this we will be able to refine
              our marketing  efforts  gain quicker market  penetration with new
              products and services  and also  ultimately  reduce our marketing
              costs

         o    our service  capabilities  stretch   across the  globe and include
              aroundtheclock  availability of welltrained technicians  which
              is  highly  valued  by our  customers  we  believe  that no other
              competitor has our capabilities and that our service  capabilities
              are a critical  success factor for us customers are continuing to
              outsource  noncore  activities  such as  service  in almost all
              cases we can provide  higherquality  service at lower costs than
              the customer can  therefore  it is important  that our customers
              have  the  right  partner  in  these  outsourcing   efforts   our
              valueadded   services   encompass    maintenance    calibration
              traceability of weights certification asset management software
              upgrades data integration and training

         o    we also utilize a dual brand strategy for certain market  segments
              to improve our overall market  penetration  for example  we sell
              balances  under  the ohaus  brand  name as an  alternative  to the
              mettlertoledo brand name in certain distribution  channels  such
              as the education market

         capitalizing  on  opportunities  in emerging  markets  we believe that
emerging  markets will continue to provide  growth  opportunities  for us these
growth  opportunities  are being driven  primarily by economic  development  and
multinationals use of additional and more sophisticated  precision  instruments
as they shift production to emerging markets in addition  we believe that over
the long term the trend toward  international  quality  standards  the need to
upgrade mechanical scales to electronic  versions and the establishment of local
production  facilities  by  our  multinational  client  base  will  add  to  the
opportunities in emerging markets

                                       5

         to date our emerging market expansion has primarily focused on asia in
asia  excluding  japan  we are  the  market  leader  in  laboratory  weighing
instruments and have a substantial  industrial and food retailing  business that
has gained market share in recent years  for instance  we have two  profitable
operations in china a facility that  manufactures and sells industrial and food
retailing  products and a facility that manufactures and distributes  laboratory
products  we also have direct marketing  organizations in taiwan  korea  hong
kong singapore  india thailand  malaysia and eastern europe beyond asia we
are also  expanding  our sales and service  presence in latin  america and other
emerging markets

         we want to continue  leveraging our chinese  manufacturing and rd as a
platform for lowend  products  which are necessary to increase our penetration
of  emerging  markets  at the same time  we are  supplying  these  products to
complementary  channels in north  america and europe  we are also  transferring
production  of many of our lowend  products  from  europe and north  america to
china  the most recent example being our ohaus electronic  laboratory  balances
and our shipping scales

         china is itself a great market for us china is striving to meet global
quality standards so it can be a significant  exporter  an increasing number of
multinationals  are investing in china  also the local market is continuing to
switch over from mechanical to electronic  weighing  for these reasons  we are
working to win a larger share of the market we developed and launched a host of
new products in china in the past two years and our  objective is to continue to
gain momentum

         pursuing  selected  acquisition  opportunities   acquisitions  are  an
integral  part of our  growth  strategy  we  believe  that  we have a  powerful
acquisition platform in the instrument industry  our acquisitions  leverage our
global  sales and  service  network  respected  brand  extensive  distribution
channels  and   technological   leadership   we  are   interested  in  pursuing
acquisitions  which have strong  strategic  fit  for  example  companies  with
complementary  products  that  will  benefit  from our  brand  name  and  global

drug discovery

         our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are all too aware of the
costs involved in drug research and development  to take a drug from the bench
to the bottle  costs on average  500 million and takes in the region of ten to
twelve  years  the  mission  of our  drug  discovery  group is to  provide  our
customers  with  integrated  solutions  that enable  chemists to increase  their
productivity and accelerate the drug discovery  process  the potential benefits
to our customers are enormous each day that a pharmaceutical company is able to
accelerate the introduction of a blockbuster drug can translate into millions of
dollars of additional revenue

         the number of drug targets and potential  lead  compounds has increased
significantly as a result of combinatorial chemistry techniques highthroughput
screening  methods and the initial  findings of the human  genome  project  the
increasing  number of targets and compounds  resulting  from these  developments
have created severe bottlenecks in the drug discovery  process  we believe that
our portfolio of integrated  technologies can bring significant  efficiencies to
the drug discovery  process  enabling our customers to create larger numbers of
higher quality candidate compounds

         the drug rd process essentially comprises six distinct phases

         o    target  identification
         o    lead identification
         o    lead optimization
         o    preclinical development and product development
         o    clinical development and process development
         o    production

         our current drug discovery  solution offering is focused on key aspects
of the lead identification lead optimization and process development phases of
the drug rd process our overall value proposition is to speed up and integrate
these phases by offering  systems  which  perform the many tasks which a chemist
has to perform in parallel and fully automated

                                       9

         in the target  identification  phase  researchers seek to identify the
genes  responsible  for disease states and  ultimately the proteins  produced by
these genes which become the target for a therapeutic drug

         lead  identification  is  the  process  of  producing  large  diverse
libraries  of tens of  thousands of  potential  drug  candidates  which are then
screened for possible biological activity against the target protein

         lead  optimization  is the process  used by  chemists  to evaluate  the
hundreds of drug candidates that may emerge from the lead identification  phase
chemists  perform  successive  rounds of chemical  synthesis to create  numerous
variants of the drug  candidates to find  compounds  likely to have  appropriate
drug  properties  chemists then  optimize the  compounds  for their  biological
potency thus creating lead compounds

         in preclinical  development and product development  process research
chemists  investigate  practical  ways to produce  individual  lead compounds in
larger quantities  also laboratory tests are performed to check the compounds
ability to pass into and out of the body without seriously toxic sideeffects

         clinical  development  and process  development is the process in which
chemists test clinical  candidates  in animals and humans to  demonstrate  their
safety and as well as efficacy  the successful  outcome of clinical  trials may
result in regulatory approval to commercialize the new drug product during this
time period process chemists optimize the method of compound synthesis prior to
commencement of large scale manufacturing of the drug

         production is the process of manufacturing bulk quantities of the final
drug both the production methodology and the analytical methods which check the
drugs composition are tightly regulated and monitored

         within our drug discovery group the chemistry  systems team focuses on
lead identification and optimization  and the reaction engineering team focuses
on process research and development  the chemistry  systems business offers the
following  solutions to  combinatorial  and medicinal  chemists  working on lead
identification and optimization

information  generated  by  checkweighing  hardware  to find  production  flaws
packaging  and  labeling  errors  and  nonuniform  products  as well as to sort
rejects and record the  results  our  checkweighing  equipment  can  accurately
determine  weight in dynamic  applications  at speeds of up to  several  hundred
units per minute checkweighers generally range in price from 8000 to 40000

         endofline  inspection  solutions   increasing  safety  and  consumer
protection  requirements  are driving  the need for more and more  sophisticated
endofline inspection systems we are the leading global provider of integrated
endofline  inspection  solutions  these high throughput solutions incorporate
sensor  technologies and software to assist  customers in fulfilling  validation
requirements  and in  improving  their  quality and yield  for  example  metal
detection  systems  control  the  removal of  products  that are  identified  as
contaminated by metal during the  manufacturing  process in the food processing
pharmaceutical  cosmetics  chemicals  and other  industries  metal  detectors
therefore   provide   manufacturers   with  vital   protection   against   metal
contamination  arising  from  their  own  production  processes  or  from  using
contaminated  raw  materials  metal  detectors  are  most  commonly  used  with
checkweighers   as  components  of  integrated   packaging  lines  in  the  food
processing  pharmaceutical  and other  industries  prices for metal  detection
systems generally range from 5000 to 20000  through our recent  acquisition
of avs we added xraybased vision  inspection  which is ideal for identifying
nonmetallic  contamination   we  feel  that  avs  is  an  excellent  strategic
complement  to our  existing  offering  of metal  detection  checkweighing  and
related quality control software systems

food retailing instruments and solutions

         we offer food retailing measurement solutions to customers in a variety
of  industries  often  in the  same end  markets  where we sell our  industrial
solutions  weighing  instruments  are among the most broadly  used  measurement
devices in industry and food retailing  we estimate that  approximately  20 of
our sales are to customers in food  retailing  environments  we believe that we
have the largest market share in the food retailing market in each of europe and
the united states in asia we have a substantial food retailing  business which
has gained  market  share in recent  years  this  business is  supported  by an
established  manufacturing  presence in china  we believe  that we are the only
company with a true global presence across food retailing weighing applications

retail weighing solutions

         retail   scale   systems  and   prepackaging   systems   supermarkets
hypermarkets and other food retail  establishments make use of multiple weighing
applications for the full handling of perishable goods for example  perishable
goods are weighed on arrival to determine payment to suppliers and some of these
goods are repackaged  priced and labeled for sale to customers other goods are
kept  loose and  selected  by  customers  and either  weighed at the  produce or
delicatessen counter or at the checkout counter we offer standalone scales for
basic counter weighing and pricing price finding and printing in addition we
offer  network  scales and  software  which can  integrate  backroom  counter
selfservice and checkout  functions  and can incorporate  weighing data into a
supermarkets overall perishable goods management system

customers and distribution

         our business is geographically diversified  with sales in 2000 derived
44 from  europe  44 from north and south  america and 12 from asia and other
countries  our customer base is also  diversified by industry and by individual
customer  our largest single customer accounted for no more than 3 of 2000 net
sales

         principal   customers  for  our  solutions  include  companies  in  the
following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech
companies  as well as independent  research  organizations  food  processors
packagers  and  retailers  specialty  chemicals and  cosmetics  companies  the
transportation  and logistics  industry  the metals  industry  the electronics
industry and the academic market

         our  laboratory  products  are sold  through a  worldwide  distribution
network  our  extensive  direct  distribution  network  and our dealer  support
activities  enable us to  maintain  a  significant  degree of  control  over the
distribution of our products  mid to highend products in the united states are
handled by our own sales force we sell laboratory  products in asia through our
own sales force and distributors  and in europe primarily through direct sales
european and asian distributors are generally fragmented on a countrybycountry
basis

         ohaus  branded   laboratory   balances  are  generally   positioned  in
alternative  distribution channels to those of mettlertoledo  branded products
this  means  that we can fill a greater  number  of  distribution  channels  and
increase penetration of our existing markets  since acquiring ohaus in 1990 we
have  expanded  this brand  beyond its  historical  us  focus  ohaus  branded
products are sold exclusively through distributors

         in the industrial and food retailing  market  we sell both directly to
customers  including  oems and  through  distributors  in the united  states
direct sales exceed distribution sales and in europe  direct sales predominate
with  distributors  used in certain  cases  we sell products in asia  primarily
through  distributors  except in china where we sell  products  through our own
sales force and distributors where we use distributors we seek to provide them
with significant support

         we  also  offer   customers  the  ability  to  shop  online  for  basic
instruments  with  global  appeal  such  as  balances   pipettes  ph  meters
electrodes titrators and density meters launched in mid1999  wwwmtshopcom

below  by  providing   feedback  on  manufacturing   and  product   development
initiatives and relaying innovative product and application ideas

         we have the only global sales and service  organization  among weighing
instruments  manufacturers  at december 31 2000  our sales and services group
consisted of more than 4000 employees in sales  marketing and customer service
including related administration and aftersales technical service this field
organization  has the capability to provide service and support to our customers
and distributors in virtually all major markets across the globe

         sales managers and  representatives  interact  across product lines and
markets in order to serve customers that have a wide range of instrument  needs
such as  pharmaceutical  companies that purchase both  laboratory and industrial
products  we classify customers  according to their potential for sales and the
appropriate  distribution  channel  is  selected  to  service  the  customer  as
efficiently  as  possible   larger   accounts  tend  to  have  dedicated  sales
representatives   other  representatives  specialize  by  product  line  sales
representatives  call  directly on endusers  either alone or in regions  where
sales are made through distributors jointly with distributors

         we utilize a variety of advertising  media  including  trade journals
catalogs  exhibitions and trade shows in addition  we also sponsor  seminars
product  demonstrations and customer training programs we utilize sophisticated
marketing  techniques  in  our  sales  efforts  these  techniques  include  the
development and utilization of marketing  databases  we develop these databases
to better  understand  the full  potential of our market by customer  location
industry instruments and related application we then utilize this data to more
efficiently direct our field resources and complement our direct and distributor
sales forces with  targeted  mailing and  telemarketing  campaigns to more fully
exploit our markets potential

         we also utilize a dual brand  strategy for certain  market  segments to
improve our overall market penetration for example we sell laboratory balances
under the ohaus brand name as an alternative to the mettlertoledo brand name in
certain distribution channels

         we use the mettlertoledo web site wwwmtcom  to provide current and
prospective  customers and other audiences with the  information  they need in a
convenient manner with several thousand pages of information  our web site has
become  a  principal  source  of  answers  for  customers   questions  on  many
laboratory industrial and food retailing processes

         in addition  we use the information  gained through visits to our site
to make our marketing  messages  even more relevant to customers  this includes
employing onetoone marketing techniques

                                       17

service

         we believe service  capabilities  are a critical  success factor in our
business through our own dedicated service technicians we provide contract and
repair  services in all  countries in which our  products are sold  we estimate
that we have the largest  installed  base of weighing  instruments in the world
and our contract and repair services  generate  significant  revenues  in 2000
service  representing   service  contracts   repairs  and  replacement  parts
accounted  for  approximately  18 of our total net sales  service  revenue  is
included in the laboratory and industrial and food retailing  sales  percentages
given above approximately half of this amount is derived from spare parts with
the  remaining   portion   derived  from  service   contacts   beyond   revenue
opportunities  service  is a  key  part  of  our  product  offering  and  helps
significantly in generating  repeat sales the close  relationships and frequent
contact with our large  customer base provides us with sales  opportunities  and
innovative  product and  application  ideas a global service network also is an
important  factor in our ability to expand in emerging  markets  moreover  the
widespread  adoption of quality  laboratory and manufacturing  standards and the
privatization of weights and measures  certification  represent favorable trends
for  our  service  business  as  they  tend  to  increase  demand  for  onsite
calibration services

         our  service  contracts  provide  for repair  services  within  various
guaranteed  response  times  depending on the level of service  selected  many
contracts also include periodic calibration and testing contracts are generally
one year in length  but may be longer  if the service  contract  also includes
products of other manufacturers we will generally perform calibration  testing
and basic repairs  directly  and contract out more significant  repair work as
application  software  becomes more complex  our service  efforts  increasingly
include installation and customer training programs as well as product service

research and development manufacturing

producing organizations

         our  product  development   research  and  manufacturing  efforts  are
organized  into a number of  producing  organizations  pos  pos are product
development  teams  comprised  of  personnel  from our  marketing  development
research manufacturing  engineering and purchasing departments pos often seek
customer  input to ensure that the  products  developed  are  tailored to market
needs  we have organized our pos to reduce product  development  time  improve
customer focus reduce costs and maintain technological leadership the pos work
together to share ideas and best  practices  and some employees are in both mos
and pos  we recently  implemented  a number of  projects  that we believe  will
further increase  productivity and lower costs for example we restructured the
order and product delivery process in europe to enable us to deliver many of our
products  to our  customers  directly  from the  manufacturing  facility  within
several  days  which  minimizes  the need to store  products  in  decentralized
warehouses  in addition we have centralized our european spare parts inventory
management  system  allowing all spare parts for europe to be  delivered  from a
single highly automated location

                                       18

research and development

         we attribute a significant  portion of our recent margin improvement to
our research and development efforts we intend to continue to invest in product
innovation  in  order  to  provide  technologically  advanced  products  to  our
customers for existing and new applications  over the last three years we have
invested more than 160 million in research and  development  in 2000 we spent
approximately  51 of net sales on research and  development  including  costs
associated with  customerspecific  engineering projects  which are included in
cost of sales for financial  reporting  purposes  our research and development
efforts fall into two categories

         o    technology advancements which increase the value of our products
              these  may  be  in  the  form  of  enhanced   functionality   new
              applications  for our  technologies  more  accurate  or  reliable
              measurement  additional software capability or automation through
              robotics or other means

         o    cost  reductions  which  reduce  the  manufacturing  cost  of our
              products through better overall design

         we  have  devoted  an   increasing   proportion  of  our  research  and
development budget to software  development  software  development for weighing
applications  includes  applicationspecific   software  as  well  as  software
utilized in sensor mechanisms  displays and other common components  which can
be leveraged across our broad product lines

         we  closely   integrate   research  and  development   with  marketing
manufacturing  and  product  engineering  we have  over  700  professionals  in
research and  development and product  engineering  as part of our research and
development  activities  we have  frequent  contact  with  university  experts
industry professionals and the governmental agencies responsible for weights and
measures  analytical instruments and metal detectors in addition our inhouse
development is complemented by technology and product development alliances with
customers and original equipment manufacturers

manufacturing

         we manufacture  some of our own  components  usually  components  that
contain  proprietary  technology  however  when outside  manufacturing is more
efficient  we contract with others for certain components and in turn use these
components in our own manufacturing  processes we use a wide range of suppliers
and we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate from time to time we rely
on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component even
then adequate alternative sources are generally available if necessary  supply
arrangements  for  electronics  are  generally  made  globally  for  mechanical
components we generally use local sources to optimize materials flow

         we strive to emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations
and  most  of  our   products   require   very  strict   tolerances   and  exact
specifications  we use an extensive  quality  control system that is integrated
into each step of the  manufacturing  process  this  integration  permits field
service  technicians to trace important  information  about the manufacture of a
particular unit which facilitates repair efforts and permits finetuning of the
manufacturing  process  many of our measuring  instruments  are subjected to an
extensive   calibration  process  that  allows  the  software  in  the  unit  to
automatically adjust for the impact of temperature and humidity

                                       19
page

         we are a  worldwide  manufacturer  with  manufacturing  plants  in the
united  states  switzerland  germany  the united  kingdom  france and china
laboratory products are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in
the united states and china  while  industrial and food retailing  products are
produced worldwide  most of our manufacturing facilities have achieved iso 9001
certification  we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet
our present and currently anticipated needs

backlog

         manufacturing  turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to
permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products which helps to
limit inventory  costs  backlog is therefore  generally a function of requested
customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months

employees

         as  of  december  31  2000  we  had  approximately   8250  employees
throughout the world  including  approximately 4500 in europe  2750 in north
and south  america  and  1000 in asia and  other  countries  we  believe  our
employee relations are good and we have not suffered any material employee work
stoppage or strike  during the last five years  labor unions do not represent a
meaningful number of our employees

         in certain of our facilities we have a flexible workforce environment
in which hours vary depending on the workload this flexible working environment
enhances employees involvement  thus increasing productivity it also improves
efficient  payroll  management  by  permitting  us to adjust  staffing  to match
workload to a greater degree without changing the size of the overall workforce

intellectual property

         we hold more than 1100 patents and trademarks primarily in the united
states  switzerland  germany the united kingdom france japan and china our
products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations some
of which  are  protected  by  patents  and some of which are not  products  are
generally not protected as a whole by individual  patents  and as a result  no
one patent or group of related  patents is  material  to our  business  we have
numerous  trademarks  including  the  mettlertoledo  name and logo  which are
material to our  business  we regularly  protect  against  infringement  of our
intellectual property

regulation

         our products are subject to various regulatory  standards and approvals
by weights  and  measures  regulatory  authorities  although  there are a large
number of regulatory  agencies across our markets  there is an increasing trend
toward  harmonization  of  standards  and weights and  measures  regulation  is
harmonized  across the european  union  our food  processing and food retailing
products  are subject to  regulation  and  approvals  by  relevant  governmental
agencies such as the united states food and drug administration  products used
in hazardous  environments may also be subject to special  requirements  all of
our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards we believe
that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations

                                       20

environmental matters

         we are subject to a variety of  environmental  laws and  regulations in
the  jurisdictions  in which we operate  including  provisions  relating to air
emissions  wastewater  discharges  the  handling  and  disposal  of solid  and
hazardous  wastes and the remediation of  contamination  associated with the use
and disposal of hazardous  substances  we wholly or partly own lease or hold a
direct or indirect equity  interest in a number of properties and  manufacturing
facilities  around  the  world  including  north  and  south  america  europe
australia and china  like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will
continue  to incur  capital  and  operating  expenditures  and  other  costs in
complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad

         we are currently involved in or have potential  liability with respect
to the remediation of past  contamination  in certain of our facilities in both
the united  states and abroad  in  addition  certain of our present and former
facilities  have or had been in operation  for many decades and over such time
some of these  facilities may have used  substances or generated and disposed of
wastes which are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that such sites
as well as disposal  sites owned by third  parties to which we have sent wastes
may in  the  future  be  identified  and  become  the  subject  of  remediation
accordingly  although we believe  that we are in  substantial  compliance  with
applicable environmental  requirements and to date we have not incurred material
expenditures in connection with  environmental  matters  it is possible that we
could become subject to additional environmental  liabilities in the future that
could result in a material adverse effect on our financial  condition or results
of operations

         we or in some cases the former owner of toledo scale  have been named
a potentially  responsible party under cercla or analogous state statutes at the
following  thirdparty  owned sites with respect to the alleged  disposal at the
sites by toledo scale during the period before we owned it  granville  solvents
site  granville  ohio  aquatech  environmental   inc  site  greer  south
carolina  and  seaboard  chemical  company  site  jamestown  north  carolina
pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase  agreement between us and the former
owner of toledo scale the former owner is obligated to indemnify us for various
environmental liabilities to date with respect to each of the foregoing sites
the former owner has undertaken the defense and indemnification of toledo scale
based on currently  available  information and given our  contractual  rights of
indemnification we believe that the costs associated with the investigation and
remediation  of these  sites  will not have a  material  adverse  effect  on our
financial condition or results of operations

competition

         our markets are highly competitive  furthermore  weighing instruments
markets are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the
industrial and food retailing weighing  instruments market as a result we face
numerous regional or specialized competitors many of which are well established
in their markets  in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger
companies with potentially  greater  financial and other resources than our own
taken  together  the  competitive  forces present in our markets can impair our
operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets

         we expect  our  competitors  to  continue  to  improve  the  design and
performance  of their  products and to introduce new products  with  competitive
prices  although  we  believe  that we have  certain  technological  and  other
advantages  over our  competitors  we may not be able to realize  and  maintain
these  advantages  in any event  to remain  competitive  we must  continue to

                                       21

page

invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and
support we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to
make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying  developing
and maintaining any competitive advantages

         we believe that the principal  competitive  factors in our us markets
for purchasing  decisions are accuracy and durability  while in europe accuracy
and service are the most important factors in emerging markets  where there is
greater demand for less sophisticated products price is a more important factor
than in developed markets competition in the united states laboratory market is
also  influenced  by the presence of large  distributors  that sell not only our
products but those of our competitors as well

item 7       managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
              results of operations

         the following  discussion  and analysis of our financial  condition and
results  of  operations   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  our  audited
consolidated financial statements

overview

         we operate a global  business  with net sales that are  diversified by
geographic  region  product  range  and  customer  we hold  leading  positions
worldwide  in many of our  markets  and  attribute  this  leadership  to several
factors   including  the  strength  of  our  brand  name  and  reputation  our
comprehensive  solution  offering  the quality of our global  sales and service
network  our  continued  investment  in  product  development  our  pursuit of
technology  leadership  and  our  focus  on  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in
developed and emerging  markets  while all of our businesses  have  significant
strategic   links  in  terms  of  technology   or  customer   base  we  have  a
geographically diverse business which serves customers in relatively healthy and
stable end markets including the pharmaceutical biotech and food industries

         our financial  information  is  presented  in accordance with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  in the united states of america us gaap

         net sales in local currency increased 9 in 2000 16 in 1999 and 8 in
1998 the  strengthening of the us dollar versus our major trading  currencies
reduced  us  dollarreported  sales  growth  in each  year  net sales in us
dollars  increased 3 in 2000 14 in 1999 and 7 in 1998 in 2000 we had local
currency  sales growth of 11 in europe  6 in the americas and 13 in asia and
other markets

         we  believe  our sales  growth  over the next  several  years will come
primarily  from our solutions  approach to the principal  challenges  facing our
customer base these include the need for increased  efficiency for example in
accelerating time to market for new products achieving better yields improving
work processes and  outsourcing  noncore  activities  the desire to integrate
information  captured by instruments into management  information  systems  the
drive for ever higher quality of our customers products and services including
the need to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards  and the move
towards globalization in all major customer groups

         acquisitions  are also an  integral  part of our growth  strategy  our
acquisitions  leverage our global sales and service  network  respected  brand
extensive   distribution   channels  and   technological   leadership   we  are
particularly  attracted to  acquisitions  which  leverage  these  attributes  or
increase our solutions  capability  for  example  software  acquisitions  in
addition  we are most attracted to the following end markets  drug  discovery
process analytics food and drug packaging and transportation and logistics

         we increased our adjusted  operating income gross profit less research
and  development  and  selling   general  and  administrative  expenses  before
amortization and nonrecurring costs as a percentage of net sales from 108 in
1998 to 130 in 2000 this improved performance was achieved while we continued
to invest in  product  development  and in our  distribution  and  manufacturing
infrastructure  we believe  that a  significant  portion of the increase in our
adjusted   operating   income  resulted  from  our  strategy  to  reduce  costs
reengineer our operations and focus on the highest valueadded  segments of the
markets in which we compete

recent acquisitions

         in 2000 we acquired berger instruments thornton inc and avs we also
increased our shareholding in cargoscan to 100

         berger  instruments  based in delaware  usa is the market  leader in
supercritical fluid chromatography sfc a highperformance  technology used to
analyze and purify chemical compounds during drug discovery  berger instruments
is an  excellent  complement  to  our  portfolio  of  automated  drug  discovery
solutions  we  already  have a  leading  position  in  sample  preparation  and
synthesis  purification is the next process step after synthesis berger allows
us to further our strategy of providing  solutions  that  automate and integrate
the drug  discovery  process  and  therefore  help  our  customers  improve  the
efficiency throughput and accuracy of their processes

         thornton inc based in  massachusetts  usa is the leader in pure and
ultrapure  industrial water monitoring  instrumentation used in semiconductor
microelectronics  pharmaceutical  and  biotech  applications  we believe the
acquisition  of thornton is an  excellent  strategic  move to expand our process
analytics business and gain access to new markets their conductivity technology
and knowhow are  complementary  to our strength in ph and oxygen  measurements
with a broader technology offering we will be better able to serve our expanded
customer base

         avs  ukbased  is a leader in xray  visioning  solutions used in the
inspection of packaged  goods  we are the leading global provider of integrated
endofline  inspection  solutions  these high throughput solutions incorporate
sensor  technologies and software to assist  customers in fulfilling  validation
requirements  and in  improving  their  quality and yield  through  avs we add
xraybased  vision  inspection  which is ideal  for  identifying  nonmetallic
contamination  in  packages  and where metal  packaging  prevents  detection  by
conventional means we feel that avs is an excellent strategic complement to our
existing offering of metal detection  checkweighing and related quality control
software systems

         cargoscan is the premier  provider of  dimensioning  technology used by
major express carriers  freight forwarders  thirdparty  logistic entities and
distribution  companies  we believe we are  uniquely  positioned  to serve this
industry  given  our  global  presence  and our  technical  knowledge  of  local
regulatory  requirements  this  transaction  underscores  our commitment to the
transportation and logistics sector and will allow us the flexibility and faster
decisionmaking necessary to exploit the substantial growth of this market

         in 1999 we acquired the testutlutrana  group a leading  manufacturer
and marketer of industrial and retail weighing instruments in france with annual
sales of approximately 50 million  we believe this acquisition is an excellent
strategic  fit given  testutlutranas  extensive  sales and service  network in
france  and  excellent  brand  recognition  by virtue of this  acquisition  we
assumed  the leading  position  in food  retail  weighing in europe and are well
positioned to meet the rapidly changing demands of our european customer base

         in 1999  we also signed an agreement to convert our 60 joint  venture
in changzhou  china into a legal structure that provides us with full control
through this change in  ownership  we are able to fully  leverage this lowcost
manufacturing  base  for  international   markets  this  move  underscores  our
strategic  commitment to asia and our belief in the  fundamental  growth factors
for the region

                                       29

         in  1998  we  acquired  three   technologically   advanced  instrument
companies in the drug discovery sector applied systems  bohdan automation inc
and myriad

         applied  systems  designs   assembles  and  markets   instruments  for
inprocess  molecular  analysis   which  is  primarily  used  for  researching
developing and  monitoring  chemical  processes  applied  systems  proprietary
sensors  together with its innovative  fourier transform  infrared  technology
enable  chemists to analyze  chemical  reactions  as they  occur  which is more
efficient than pulling samples

         bohdan is a leading  supplier of  laboratory  automation  and automated
synthesis  products to the automated drug and chemical compound discovery market
used in research for life science  applications  myriad designs  assembles and
markets  instruments that facilitate and automate the synthesis of large numbers
of chemical compounds in parallel  which is a key step in the chemical compound
discovery  process  its products can be used in all stages of synthesis in drug
discovery

cost reduction programs

         as part of our efforts to reduce  costs  we evaluate from time to time
the cost  effectiveness  of our  global  manufacturing  strategy  in  2000  we
recorded a charge of 14 million related to the closedown and consolidation of
operations over the next few years we also intend to continue to develop china
as a lowcost manufacturing resource and to seek other manufacturing costsaving
opportunities  in this  respect  we recorded a charge of 80  million in 1999
associated with the transfer of production  lines from the americas to china and
europe  and the  closure  of  facilities  these  charges  relate  primarily  to
severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including
lease  termination  costs and the writedown of impaired assets we believe that
the future cash benefits of these  programs will exceed the costs  although the
cash outflows  will precede the cash flow  benefits  activities  related to the
charge recorded in 1999 were significantly completed in 2000

         in 1999 we launched a worldwide  procurement  project  the project is
intended to  eliminate  price  differences  between  units  leverage  potential
opportunities  to  increase  buying  power  and  establish  worldwide  sourcing
arrangements  we envision it will take at least two years to obtain anticipated
benefits from this project

         during  1999  we also  exited  our glass  batching  business  based in
belgium  in this  respect  we  incurred  losses of 41  million  during  1999
primarily for severance and other costs of exiting this  business  we completed
our exit of the glass batching business by the end of 1999

a   in connection with acquisitions in 1999  including the acquisition of the
      testutlutrana  group  we allocated 998 of the purchase price to revalue
      certain inventories  principally  workinprogress and finished goods to
      fair value net realizable value substantially all such inventories were
      sold during the second quarter of 1999

b   in  connection  with the  bohdan  acquisition  we  allocated  based upon
      independent valuations 9976 of the purchase price to purchased research
      and  development  in  process  this  amount  was  recorded  as an expense
      immediately following the bohdan acquisition

c   other charges  net generally  includes interest income  foreign currency
      transactions  gains  losses from sales of assets and other  items  the
      2000 amount also includes a charge of 1425 related to the closedown and
      consolidation  of operations  the 1999 amount includes a gain on an asset
      sale of approximately  3100  a charge of 8007 to transfer  production
      lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of  facilities
      and losses of  approximately  4100 in connection  with the exit from our
      glass batching business based in belgium for the years ended december 31
      1999 and 1998 the amount shown also includes 825 and 650 respectively
      of  expenses  incurred  on  behalf  of  certain  selling  shareholders  in
      connection with our secondary offerings in 1999 and 1998 respectively

d   adjusted  operating  income is defined as operating  income  gross profit
      less  research and  development  and selling  general and  administrative
      expenses before amortization and nonrecurring costs nonrecurring costs
      which have been  excluded  are the costs set forth in note a  above  we
      believe  that  adjusted  operating  income  provides  important  financial
      information in measuring and comparing our operating performance adjusted
      operating income is not intended to represent  operating income under us
      gaap and should not be considered as an  alternative to net earnings as an
      indicator of our operating performance

year ended december 31 2000 compared to year ended december 31 1999

         net sales were 10955  million for the year ended  december 31 2000
compared to 10655 million in the prior year this reflected an increase of 9
in local currencies  during 2000  results for 2000 were negatively  impacted by
the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies net sales in us
dollars during 2000 increased 3

         net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in
europe increased 11 in local currencies during 2000 versus the prior year the
increase  reflected  organic  growth  in our  business  and  the  effect  of the
testutlutrana  acquisition  net sales in local  currencies  during 2000 in the
americas  increased  6 net sales in asia and other  markets  increased  13 in
local  currencies  during  2000  the results of our  business in asia and other
markets during 2000 reflect strong sales performance in china and japan

         the operating  results for  testutlutrana  which were included in our
results from may 1 1999 would have had the effect of increasing  our net sales
by an additional 163 million in 1999

08 million relating to the secondary offering completed in 1999

         our  effective  tax  rate of 35 before nonrecurring items in 2000 was
consistent with the previous year

         net earnings were 715  million in 2000  compared to 579 million in

charges  and the 80  million  charge to  transfer  production  lines  from the
americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities were 579 million in
1999  compared to 483 million in 1998  this represents an increase of almost
30 excluding the onetime tax benefit of 36 million received in 1998

liquidity and capital resources

         at december 31 2000  our  consolidated  debt net of cash was 2666
million  we had  borrowings of 2377  million  under our credit  agreement and
507 million under various other  arrangements  as of december 31 2000 of our
credit agreement  borrowings  approximately

                                       33
page

1278 million was borrowed as term loans scheduled to mature in 2004 and 1099
million was  borrowed  under a  multicurrency  revolving  credit  facility  at
december 31 2000 we had 2935  million of  availability  remaining  under the
revolving credit facility

         at december 31 2000  approximately  1102  million of the borrowings
under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated
in us  dollars  the balance of the borrowings  under the credit agreement and
local  working  capital  facilities  were  denominated  in  certain of our other
principal  trading  currencies  amounting  to  approximately  1782  million at
december 31 2000  changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
generate cash flow and the currencies in which our  borrowings  are  denominated
affect our liquidity in addition because we borrow in a variety of currencies
our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates

         under the credit  agreement  amounts  outstanding under the term loans
are  payable in  quarterly  installments  in  addition  the  credit  agreement
obligates us to make  mandatory  prepayments in certain  circumstances  with the
proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital  stock or  indebtedness  and with
certain excess cash flow the credit agreement  imposes certain  restrictions on
us and our subsidiaries  including  restrictions and limitations on the ability
to pay dividends to our  shareholders  incur  indebtedness  make  investments
grant liens  sell financial assets and engage in certain other  activities  we
must also comply with  several  financial  covenants  the credit  agreement  is
secured by most of our assets

         cash  provided by operating  activities  totaled 847 million in 2000
compared to 913  million in 1999 and 720  million in 1998  the  decrease in
2000 resulted  principally  from a onetime  payment of 42 million  associated
with an early  retirement  plan from previous  years  as well as an increase in
inventory levels associated with product introductions production transfers and
increased safety stocks of electronics  in 1999 we also increased our accounts
payable  terms with many  suppliers to improve our working  capital  efficiency
this resulted in an increase in cash  provided by operating  activities of 162
million in 1999 we  maintained  these  payment  terms in 2000  and  therefore
accounts payables were not a source of cash in 2000

         during 2000  we spent  approximately  555  million on  acquisitions
including  approximately  102 million of additional  consideration  related to
earnout periods  associated with acquisitions  consummated in december of 1998
seller financing of 276 million and working capital retained by sellers these
purchases  were  funded  from cash  generated  from  operations  and  additional
borrowings  we continue to explore potential  acquisitions  in connection with
any acquisition we may incur additional indebtedness in addition we expect to
make additional  earnout payments relating to certain of these  acquisitions in
the future

         capital  expenditures  are a  significant  use of  funds  and are  made
primarily for machinery equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities
our capital  expenditures  totaled 293 million in 2000  292 million in 1999
and 286 million in 1998  we expect  capital  expenditures  to increase as our
business grows and fluctuate as currency exchange rates change

         we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities together
with borrowings  available under the credit  agreement and local working capital
facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently  anticipated  working  capital
needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for
at least  several  years  but there can be no  assurance  that this will be the
case

effect of currency on results of operations

         because we conduct  operations in many countries  our operating income
can be significantly  affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates swiss
francdenominated  expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating
expenses than swiss francdenominated sales represent of our net sales in part
this is  because  most of our  manufacturing  costs  in  switzerland  relate  to
products  that  are  sold  outside  of  switzerland   moreover  a  substantial
percentage   of  our   research  and   development   expenses  and  general  and
administrative  expenses are incurred in  switzerland  therefore  if the swiss
franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg the
us dollar  the euro  other major european  currencies and the japanese yen
our  operating  profit is  reduced  we also have  significantly  more  sales in
european  currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those
currencies  therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar
and the swiss franc it also decreases our operating  profits  in recent years
the  swiss  franc  and  other  european  currencies  have  generally  moved in a
consistent  manner versus the us  dollar  therefore  because the two effects
previously described have offset each other our operating profits have not been
materially  affected  by  movements  in the us  dollar  exchange  rate  versus
european  currencies  however  there can be no assurance that these currencies
will continue to move in a consistent  manner in the future  in addition to the
effects of exchange  rate  movements on operating  profits  our debt levels can
fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates particularly between the us dollar
and the swiss franc

european economic and monetary union

         within  europe  the european  economic and monetary  union the emu
introduced a new currency the euro on january 1 1999 switzerland is not part
of the emu

         on january 1 1999  the  participating  countries  adopted the euro as
their local  currency  initially  available  for  currency  trading on currency
exchanges and noncash banking transactions the existing local currencies or
legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january 1 2002  beginning
on  january 1  2002  eurodenominated  bills and coins will be issued for cash
transactions  for a period of six months from this date both legacy currencies
and the euro will be legal tender  on or before july 1 2002 the participating
countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro

         we have recognized the introduction of the euro as a significant  event
with potential  implications for existing operations  currently  we operate in
all of the  participating  countries  in the  emu  we  expect  nonparticipating
european union countries where we also have operations may eventually join the
emu

         we have  committed  resources to conduct risk  assessments  and to take
corrective  actions   where  required  to  ensure  we  are  prepared  for  the
introduction of the euro we have undertaken a review of the euro implementation
and have  concentrated on areas such as operations  finance  treasury  legal
information  management  procurement  and  others  both in  participating  and
nonparticipating  european  union  countries  where we operate  also  existing
legacy  accounting  and  business  systems and other  business  assets have been
reviewed for euro compliance  including assessing any risks from third parties
progress regarding euro implementation is reported periodically to management


                                       35

         because of the staggered  introduction  of the euro regarding  noncash
and cash transactions we have developed our plans to address our accounting and
business  systems first and our business  assets second  we were euro compliant
within our accounting  and business  systems by the end of 1999 and expect to be
compliant within our other business assets prior to the introduction of the euro
bills and coins compliance in participating and nonparticipating countries will
be achieved primarily through upgraded systems which were previously planned to
be upgraded remaining systems will be modified to achieve compliance we do not
currently  expect to experience any  significant  operational  disruptions or to
incur any significant costs including any currency risk which could materially
affect our liquidity or capital  resources  we are  preparing  plans to address
issues within the  transitional  period when both legacy and euro currencies may
be used

         we continue to assess our pricing strategy throughout europe due to the
increased  price  transparency  created by the euro and are attempting to adjust
prices in some of our markets  we are also  encouraging our suppliers  even in
switzerland  to commence  transacting  in the euro  we do not believe that the
effect of these adjustments will be material

         we have a disproportionate amount of our costs in swiss francs relative
to sales  historically  the potential  currency  impact has been muted because
currency   fluctuations  between  the  swiss  franc  and  other  major  european
currencies have been minimal and there is greater balance between total european
including  swiss sales and costs  however  if the  introduction  of the euro
results in a  significant  weakening of the euro  against the swiss  franc  our
financial performance could be harmed

         the statements set forth herein concerning the introduction of the euro
which are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements that involve risks
and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ  materially  from
those in the  forwardlooking  statements  in particular  the costs associated
with our euro  programs  and the  timeframe  in which we plan to complete  euro
modifications are based upon  managements best estimates  these estimates were
derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events there can be
no guarantee  that any  estimates or other  forwardlooking  statements  will be
achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated

taxes

         we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  throughout the world
our  effective  tax rate  and tax  liability  will be  affected  by a number  of
factors such as the amount of taxable income in particular  jurisdictions  the
tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent
to which we transfer  funds between  jurisdictions  and repatriate  income  and
changes in law generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group
is determined either i on a  nonconsolidatednoncombined  basis or ii on a
consolidatedcombined  basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in
the same  jurisdiction  in either case without  regard to the taxable losses of
nonconsolidatednoncombined affiliated legal entities as a result we may pay
income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a
net loss for the period

environmental matters

         we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including
those  relating  to air  emissions  wastewater  discharges  the  handling  and
disposal of solid and  hazardous  wastes

                                       36
page

and the  remediation  of  contamination associated with the use and disposal of
hazardous substances

         we  incur  capital  and  operating   expenditures   in  complying  with
environmental  laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad we are
currently  involved  in  or have  potential  liability  with  respect  to  the
remediation of past  contamination  in facilities  both in the united states and
abroad in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for
many decades and may have used  substances  or generated  and disposed of wastes
that are hazardous or may be considered  hazardous in the future such sites and
disposal  sites  owned by  others to which we sent  waste  may in the  future be
identified as contaminated and require remediation  accordingly it is possible
that we could become  subject to  additional  environmental  liabilities  in the
future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition  however
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition as a result of future costs of environmental compliance

inflation

         inflation  can affect the costs of goods and services  that we use the
competitive  environment  in which we operate  limits  somewhat  our  ability to
recover higher costs through  increased selling prices  moreover  there may be
differences  in inflation  rates  between  countries in which we incur the major
portion of our costs and other  countries in which we sell  products  which may
limit our ability to recover  increased costs we remain committed to operations
in china latin america and eastern europe which have experienced  inflationary
conditions  to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on
our  operating  results  however  if our presence in china  latin america and
eastern europe  increases  these  inflationary  conditions could have a greater
impact on our operating results

seasonality

         our business has  historically  experienced a slight amount of seasonal
variation with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than and sales in the
fourth quarter  slightly  higher than  sales in the second and third  quarters
this trend has a somewhat  greater effect on income from  operations than on net
sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

         we have only limited involvement with derivative financial  instruments
and do not use them for trading purposes

         we have  entered  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to hedge
shortterm  intercompany  balances with our foreign  businesses  such contracts
limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable  currency  fluctuations  a
sensitivity  analysis  to  changes in the us  dollar and swiss  franc on these
foreign  currencydenominated  contracts  indicates that if the us  dollar and
swiss franc uniformly worsened by 10 against all of our currency exposures the
fair value of these  instruments  would decrease by 12 million at december 31
2000 as compared with 27 million at december 31 1999 any resulting  changes
in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying  hedged balance sheet
position  the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency
exchange rates  the assumption  that exchange rates change in parallel  fashion
may overstate the impact of changing  exchange  rates on assets and  liabilities
denominated  in a  foreign  currency  we also  have  other  currency  risks  as
described under effect of currency on results of operations

                                       37
page

         we have entered into certain  interest rate swap agreements in order to
limit our exposure to  increases in interest  rates  these  contracts  are more
fully  described  in note 5 to our audited  consolidated  financial  statements
based on our  agreements  outstanding  at december  31  2000 a 100 basis point
increase in  interest  rates  would  result in an increase in the net  aggregate
market value of these instruments of 08 million as compared with 94 million
at december 31 1999  conversely  a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates
would result in a 07 million net reduction in the net  aggregate  market value
of these  instruments  as compared with 94 million at december 31 1999  any
change in fair value would not affect our  consolidated  statement of operations
unless such  agreements  and the variable rate debt they hedge were  prematurely
settled

         we have  designated  certain of our swiss  franc debt as a hedge of our
net  investments  a sensitivity  analysis to changes in the us dollar on such
debt at december  31 2000  indicates  that if the us  dollar  weakened by 10
against  the swiss  franc  the fair value of such debt would  increase  by 97
million as compared with 51 million at december 31 1999 any changes in fair
value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive  income and offset the impact on
comprehensive  income of foreign exchange  changes on the net investments  which
they hedge

new accounting standards

         in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission staff released
staff  accounting  bulletin sab no 101  revenue  recognition in financial
statements  which  provides  guidance  on the  recognition  presentation  and
disclosure  of  revenue  in  financial  statements  sab no  101 did not have a
material impact on our financial position and results of operations

         in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of  financial   accounting   standards  no  133   accounting  for  derivative
instruments and hedging activities this statement  establishes  accounting and
reporting  standards for derivative  instruments  including certain  derivative
instruments   embedded  in  other   contracts   collectively   referred  to  as
derivatives  and for hedging activities  it requires that an entity recognize
all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities in the statement of financial
position  and  measure  those  instruments  at fair  value  this  statement  is
effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000
the adoption of this statement will not have a material  effect on our financial
condition or results of operations

12           taxes  continued

         the company has recorded  valuation  allowances related to its deferred
income tax assets due to the  uncertainty of the ultimate  realization of future
benefits  from such assets  the 2000 net change in the  valuation  allowance is
primarily  attributable to the changes as enumerated  above which are related to
improved  realization  potential andor  utilization of associated  deferred tax
assets

         the potential  decrease or increase of the  valuation  allowance in the
near term is  dependent on the future  realizability  of the deferred tax assets
which  are  affected  by the  future  profitability  of  operations  in  various
worldwide  jurisdictions  but  primarily  in the  united  states  a  valuation
allowance has been provided on the companys net deferred tax assets  related to
its  united  states  operations  because  of  the  uncertainty  regarding  their
realizability  due to the expectation that deductions from future employee stock
option  exercises and related tax deductions  will exceed future taxable income
deferred  tax  assets of 12  million  at  december  31  2000  pertain  to net
operating loss  carryforwards  resulting  from the exercise of certain  employee
stock options when recognized the tax benefit of these losses will be recorded
in shareholders equity

         the total valuation  allowances  relating to acquired businesses amount
to 155 million and 167 million at december 31 2000 and 1999  respectively
the reduction for the current year is primarily  attributable to the utilization
of net  operating  losses  and the  expiration  of the  useful  life of  various
deferred  tax assets  future  reductions  of these  valuation  allowances  will
continue to be credited to goodwill when realized

         at december 31 2000 for us federal income tax purposes the company
had net operating  loss  carryforwards  of 213 million which expire in various
amounts  through  2012 and other  tax  credits  of 06  million  which  have no
expiration  the company has various us state net operating losses and various
foreign operating losses that expire in varying amounts through 2012

13           other charges net

         other charges net consists primarily of foreign currency transactions
interest income  charges related to the companys  costreduction  programs and
gains on the sale of property plant and equipment

         as part of its efforts to reduce costs the company evaluates from time
to time the cost  effectiveness of its global  manufacturing  strategy  in this
respect  the company recorded  charges of  approximately  14 million and 80
million  in 2000 and 1999  respectively  associated  with the  closedown  and
consolidation  of operations in 2000 and the transfer of production  lines from
the  americas to china and europe and the  closure of  facilities  in 1999  the
charges  comprised  primarily  severance and other related benefits and costs of
exiting  facilities  including  lease  termination  costs and the writedown of
impaired  assets  in  connection  with  these   activities   the  company  has
involuntarily  terminated  approximately  180 employees  and expects to further
terminate  60 employees in 2001  activities  related to the charge  recorded in
1999 were significantly completed in 2000
